la verdad quisiera poder decir algo de este juego pero sus servidores se la pasana eternamente ocupados y cuando me ha dejado entrar no me deja ni siquiera avanzar en la creación del personaje cuando ya me boto muy mal pésimo en ese sentido

infestation survivor stories was by far my favorite game back in the day minus the cheaters infestation newz has brought back memories old friends and just a great pvp game in general with new independent developers that had nothing to do with the old scam s i am enjoying this game to the moon and back its sad to see people give out bad reviews because they are either a bad at the game or b thinking its the same old devs dont listen to the spam negative reviews check for the honest reviews

early access reviewone rocket thats four hundred and fifty credits please thanks now whave a nice day you bassicaly spent thirteen of the credits your going to earn this match from that one rocket and it takes about three to kill a tank so enjoy earning absolutely nothing this match its obvious that this game promotes paying to win or grinding all day to get a single wepon trust me about this look how many hours i spent playing this trash you spend more time grinding in this game than actually playing it not worth spending any time playing this just go and play ww2 online its the same except theirs no where near the grinding and the game is one huge map what takes hours to walk from one side to the other seriously its the most realistic war game ever instead of the same six maps over and over

the devs continue to ruin this game with their consistent poorlyexecuted patches theyve turned what used to be a fastpaced actionpacked flight game into a tortuous grind to get new planes and then more grind to maxout the features each plane has engine power guns ammoordinance etcthe mods are far too heavyhanded with their chat bans if you say a word they dont agree with or talk about anything other than planesthe game itself you stand a good chance of being muzzled for variable durations at their whim and mood too many of the other players are either forced to be selfcentered greedy little psychopaths or for whatever reason are just maladjusted human flotsam that choose to play against the team the objectives or just cause grief and mayhem at every opportunity the game itself is really amazing if you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint youll probably enjoy the hell out of it for awhile good luck
just a great game if you love neverwinter i like the fact that i can play with my nine year old grandson and now he wants to play table top dd when i was young you where told that you would go to hell for playing these types of games i truly beleive it has opened my grandsons eyes to a world that feeds his imagination while schooling him in math i give this game an a along with eveonline
this game is awesome here is my session in a nutshell join match die twenty times kill someone gets happy and dies again repeat game does get a little lagy at really intense battles but most of the time its good great game get it its freeeeeeeeee
heroes generals is a game with much potential or rather had much potential a while ago hell id even say the game is quite good but its the developers and the insane grind that ruin this game if you want any info on why the devs are completely awful i reckon you can just read another review that is negative and see what i mean but the reason this game was ruined for me personally was the insane grind that comes with the game this game is not free2play its pay2win and thats a shame because the core concept of the game is good its a shame that the developers and completely unable to do anything good to the game thanks for reading
i love this and dont even really know why haha its kinda like when everybody had firbies or when everybody had those digital pet things back in the 90s i guess the combination of micromanaging resources as well as inventory management quests and dweller trainingmanagement keeps it fun enough for me to want to check back in a few times a day for like three thousand and forty minutes to do random crap i played this in beta through bethesdas launcher alot more than i have through steam but back then it was missing alot of the cooler features it has now like the branching quests and stuff i thought that was a great addition and several of the dialogue options i had when stumbling accross a random quest in the wasteland were actually better than dialogue options in fo4 at least thats what i thought but hey im just some random dood who doesnt know crap about that kinda stuff this game is awesome up until your base gets rekt by deathclaws and all your dwellers are dead and you dont have enough caps to revive them at that point i think its pretty normal to ragequit and promise yourself youll never play this stupid addictive game again as long as you still have breath only to return the next day and do it all over again dont ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever pay for the lunchboxes the wonders of pc gaming make it so lunch boxes are still accessible without paying a dime if thats how you want to play some people may find it more interesting to get everything the hard way and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that just have fun and dont spend your hard earned cash on microtransactions that are completely superfluous
early access reviewive tried this game and it is actually great good things about it it is similar to csgo with the keybinding and stuff ranking system good aim and yea probably loads of other good stuff bad things when you buy the armor which gives u fifty defense then buy twentyfive defense one you get the twentyfive defense one and loses fifty which should be fixed imo u should either get seventyfive or a windows appearing saying you already own this etc also when you die your weapon should drop and you have to rebuy them from the shop makes the game more challening and fun dalthough i know its early access but still thanks for me great game still
at first i didnt understan why so many people hated this game when i first launched it it made me sign up for an account it was a bit of an inconvenience but not horrible i entered a server and the loading time took around two minutes so then i thought well if it takes this long to load it must have stunning graphics right no the trees leaves looked smudged the grass was just a single color and the sky wasnt that badokay maybe the character animations are good i said nyeti took a swim and the regular swim animation is fine not very realistic but fine but then i pressed shift you break into a buggy animaton where you become an unrealisticly amazing olympic swimmer the sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoyingokay once i find some itens itll be more funneini wasnt able to find any items because i was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower wellâ â â â â â i say at least ill respawn instantlynieyou have to wait three minutes to respawn in a game youll most likely die fairly often if you want to spawn back in instantly you have to useechhhjust thinking about makes me sick to my stomach you have to use in game currency at this point im so fed up i uninstall it as fast as would uninstall again
a fun game to get into for the air combat however the ground combat leaves somthing to be desired as you will be constantly one shoted i know that the game is ment to be realistic however the rendering range for the ground is terable air combat is good overall however i would advise you look away from arcade battles and more into realistic in arcade the person with the mostbigger guns is usually the winner only other grib with the game is microtansactions and a pay to win modle
time to update the review and it will be negative developers prooved themselves compared to dire wolf the new update ruined the perfomance of the game not to mention the glitches you ruined the game completely
currently my favorite game really fun moba with normal movement tps camera skillshots and a hella lot of fun it isnt p2w you can get the normal currency very easily by playinglogging in and you can get gems aka the premium currency by logging in doing certain promotional stuff thanatos i â â â â ing love you
early access reviewwonderfull graphic with great and simle systemalsow good dayly event sys alsow its not that hard to buy new shipsmuch better balans than in other popular mmo vechaicle gamesjust try if you like sf d
one of the best free games i ever played in this kind of games when i first started playing it i wouldnt have thouight that it was much for the world but after severals hours behind it i could just say that this game gott me hooked it is not a pay to win game you could spend money on it but its just not worth it since you will end upp with things you really want after a couple of hours behind it what you doo need is a good team on the battelfield and you will suceess with almost everything the only bad things thats commes too my mind when i am writing this is that autobalance some times split partys too get more even teams we should at least have been giving an option for if we want to be splited or not some minor buggs has comes out on the newest patch but the devlopers of the game is already working on a fix for it
the latest update module six marked the demise of neverwinter the often ptw mrpg is now fubar characters are nerfed and opponents buffed in an attempt to get you to buy too much too soon too bad
dcs world is a great sim however it does have a huge learning curve for those who like the hard core sim where every buttion and switch is modeled in the aircraft look no further lucky for people who arent so hard core there is the flaming cliffs three module although this module still takes a bit to figure out how to use the planes some you tube vids and some button mapping to a good quality joystick and dogfighting is a blast fc3 adds the f15c su27 these planes are pretty easy to fly you dont have to pull twenty switches to fire a cannon after playing a bit in fc3 and finally getting the hang of radar and beyond vis fighting i found dcs fc3 to be and enjoyable and challanging sim dodging heat seekers by dropping flares and pulling hard 79g turns only to have the missile pass beneath the belly of the aircraft by a factor of meters is such a rush and then winning your first airvictory and then your first combat sortie is somthing that instills a sort of pride in you tldr dcs world modules like a10cblack shark two and other stand alone planes are more suited to the hard core players even though there is a game mode its not very well explained fc3 with a small amount of learning can be a rewarding and fun module for the sim junkie ps look up youtube tutorials as they tend to explain how to use the systems better i found this one helped alot with the f15 http www youtube comwatch however dont try to learn it all at once you wont reamember and become frustrated
this game is like a celebrations chocolate tin looks nice on the outside but has a sewing kit inside what i dont understand how this game mechanic microtransaction menu and general ai is worst than simraceway which is just about deadcaptain picard facepalm
i love this game as someone who hates how most pc games spead the ui all over my big 1200p monitor its nice to have a game which makes everything big and close enough that i dont have to worry about looking at the game i also have tons of money and hate how most games only allow me to spend it on the base game this game has no such issue and its loading screens tell me about all the best things to spend my money on rant time i hate how so many pc games these days have all these fancy and confusing options menus all the massive textures filling up my hard drives all the audio sliders and color blind modes who cares about color blind mode i hate it i hate it all its confusing and takes up too much hard drive spacerant overbut seriously guys the only thing i dont like about this game is that they got the stupid voice actor from the movie and hes everywhere in the tutorial the options menus arent confusing only five options yay the textures are small and compressed to minimize hdd space and i can spend my money as much as i want and ill never run out of things to buy1110 would play sheep football again
early access reviewbefore i start i would like to say that i am not trying to hate if you like the game how it is now that is totally in your hands and is fantastic for you i liked the game i think it was a year ago that i played it for the first time i had seen my friends play it and when i got in i had massive amounts of fun and it was one of the games that got me into the entire gaming thing after a while i stopped playing i was never someone who plays a game for more than a month after a while i came back there was a massive update they said so i went online and searched the community was raging so i start the game i see that levels are now used for items it annoys me i played together with my friends and my friends played for far longer but i had the highest level because somehow i gor far more kills so now the game would be too easy for one of us or too hard for someone else i quit and now i came back when my friend said that game had updated again they had removed the wierd level thing but instaid of that they had installed another wierd system you now have loot soooo that means that its like destiny now i have nothing against destiny but i dont really like the loot system well i think they should take the game back to the beta version back when levels where for blocks currency for blocks and tech points still existed cons one wierd irritating challange ratings2 random loot three pay to wincons for players that played the beta one you have to build an entire new robot2 all money is gone3 new play styles4 too much new weapons5 very different progres system tops one a lot of customization2 the actual battle moments are good3 more than one weapon sort on one robot conclusion well if you are a new player i would say you should try it if you are a beta player you are in for a shock the game now has so many weapons that everybody has his own play style that said i am stil using a modified version of my old vehicle and i am doing ok the thing is that you will almost never stumble into a game where people work together because everyone has different weapons and if you want to build a robot you will have to slowly build it up by the round
this is a very fun game that i would recommend to anyonei used to not play this game very often it just didnt seem interesting to me not one bit but then i slowly began to start playing it more and more and now im hooked and i just love it the characters the playable classes the maps the game modes its nothing but hours of endless fun sure youll come across hackers every once in a while and being put on a team with terrible teammates isnt exactly uncommon but all the negative stuff aside this game is amazingeven if you dont like shooter games give this game a chance it originally wasnt my thing but now its my favorite gamethere are a lot of things you can do in it inculding taunts with the playable classes and along with that theyre all different which distinct cosmetics hats and so on they also have their own personalites as shown in the meet the team videos on youtube but if youre interested in the actual game rather than the characters just dont search them up ive played each class at least once and yet its still really fun to experiment with them because there are plenty of things ive never done before with each of themas for gamemodes well theres a ton of them meaning that if you dislike one there will be one youll like gamemodes inculde payload control points mvm etc there are only a couple of problems with this game that i think are worth putting into this review the first one being matchmaking the weird way that servers are done i hope for this to undone in the future the second problem isnt with the game itself but with the playerbase but i understand that theres no way to control people and people are going to be rude no matter what online game youre playing the main reason i put the second one is because its common to come across twelve year old kids that are too young to even be playing this game screaming swear words into their micrphones but just mute them and all is good overall get this game but as i said earlier its nothing but hours of endless fun
ehh good at start but when at about level thirty or so it just starts to get boring as heck and one other thing to get chests the eazy way is for wasting your on stupid chests that arent even good at allalso never and i mean never get this piece of junk you call a game
early access reviewthis game isnt a game its a chore once you make something you feel good it has a problem a few minutes later you think you fix it then another problem arises its an infinite loop of chores and annoyance and it never even gives you any stats for anything or any way to tell what something does ive probably spent more time on this games discussion board asking how something works more than i have playing the game here is an example of one of the crappy descriptionsqueen bee she needs things to be just so before she gets the drones working theres no explanation to what just so is supposed to mean how are we supposed to know what we have to do to get it to work the swords and armors have no stats so we can never tell how much more armored and powerful we will beprosthe atmosphere in caves is nicepretty good graphicsthe creatures look goodconsbad physics my character flies like a bouncy ball on a trampoline boring repetitive gameplaybad optimizationis another cubebased creationadventure gamegod awful item descriptions
war thunder is a game that allows you to command planes tanks or other ground vehicles like trucks and eventually naval vessels in pvp and pve matches the selection of vehicles you have range from pre ww2 usually around the time of the spanish civil war all the way up to the korean war and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the usa germany ussr britain and japan at the moment japan only has aircraft but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too there could possibly be more nations added in the future but not much info has been provided on that additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations the game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches these are arcade realistic and simulator arcade battles are the most popular enemy nametags appear when in your line of sight mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a colored marker appears when youre aiming at an enemy with the three different colors greenyellowred indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate realistic battles has realistic mobility characteristics though not at the same level of simulator mode limited markers nametags still appear but the lead circle and the colored marker are gone and realistic team matchups you wont see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode simulator mode does what realism mode does but takes it up to eleven you can only view your plane from inside the cockpit some of the cockpit interiors arent out yet but you still get some kind of firstperson view nonetheless and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield the pvp portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets generally the role of attackersbombers and destroy enemy planes generally the role of in the common ground strike mode there are also the game modes domination which involves landing on air fields to capture them and air domination where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone the more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives like the attacking side is helping an ai ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them tank variety in objective types isnt much better which are usually just capture and hold points on the map this is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavymediumlight tanks spaa armored trucks regular trucks with mounted machine guns ussr plz the realistic modes objectives dont change much for ground forces but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time the pve portion of the game can be done solo or with friends at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content the pve content includes single missions where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective dynamic campaign where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map and historical battles which you have to buy with the steam pack or ingame which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cutscenes added though there doesnt seem to be much of a point to doing these pve activities because they dont provide much of a reward which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game the grind this game is very grind heavy especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription if you really want to try out the jets youre going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game but i can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play all of the vehicles are very well designed while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practicing and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle youre facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight the game isnt p2w either well i guess that depends on what your definition of p2w is most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics or speeding up game progression the only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew which improves the performance of your vehicle but if youre willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew while this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games in my opinion it isnt the absolute best if you want that go for dcs world if you decide to play this i would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there dont try to rush to the end game because it isnt that great if you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments just try to have fun in the end this review ended up being much longer than i expected
the game has a great concept i however found it hard to play as many times as it crashed froze i have a decent gaming computer this was unacceptable it was completely unplayable for friends but from what i could actually play it was fun i wish it was better
early access reviewalright listen here folks it was a good match all was well five kills then i go and loot this body and im on the ground then i try to stand up logically by pressing c like all games then i was killed this has happened three times and im very dissapointed serious reviewthe game is fun and all but the animationcharacter movement and control is absolute when i aim i dont expect for the camera and the gun to be flying over the place like princess leia in that one scene of star wars were she turns into a space fairy and flies off the graphics are alright but its not really treated well with the camera movement when you are in first person you can barely control yourself and in third person you feel asif you are trying to move in a giant ing soup ladle filed with grease and russian man juices one thousand and ten issa mastapiece babyy
early access reviewgreat game if youre into scifi and mobas totally paid for it even tho it is free to support the developers id love to see this game have more content in the future
although its kinda different from the game i remember this game is lit af definitely recommend to everyone who loved yugioh as a kidnever thought id go back to loving yugioh the original voice actors voicing everything makes it 10000x more nostalgic much love to dan green and his family pls never add synchro monsters or anything from 5ds or passed that bc i dont know from there lmao
avoid at all costs if you can even get the registation to work trove requires you to register with and use a seperate launcher which at registration asks for a bunch of details that no game on steam should need using the registration link from the launcher doesnt work it opens a registration page in your default browser which doesnt actually do anything and will not allow you to register if you use firefox it wont even have the input boxes labeled correctly if you go to the effort of actually tracking down a registration page that will actually do something when you click the submit button you will only be successful if you have given them enough information to sell your details for advertising including giving them an unsecure email address that can be easily spammed if you try to use any kind of secure email forwarder or even a more secure email provider like gmx they will not allow you to register at all a free game is not free is i have to sell my soul to play it and any game that demands i not use an email address because it has decent spam protection is not a game i want anything to do with
this game is a petri dish an enviroment for which the vilest and most putrid of gamers can thrive and cultivate to their hearts content i walked into this world unsuspecting and walked right back out changed scarred by the soviet fires and new meta revolutions i would favour my eyes being scooped out viscously with one of those mcflurry spoons than spend further time drowning in this cesspool of a f2p game unfortunately i still need my eyes in order to investigate this growing red menace and further stop the vlads stalins and ivans from further infiltrating the steam network and send them right back to the ak47 mines from which they spawned terrible910joe mccarthy had the right idea
the game in general is really fun and it captures the spirit of bloons wonderfully unfortunately its overshadowed by the absolute terrible balancing the game has the game has two main modes attack mode or defense mode attack mode allows you to send bloons at your foe for money and you will receive increased money per turn defense mode is just you going head to head with someone without sending the bloons attack mode is probably most popular and the best mode in my opinion its really great to select your towers for the game and plan out what youll do and send certain bloons at your enemy depending on the towers they have you can only choose three types of bloons and you can get a random one for energy this isnt too bad but it does often feel like you dont quite have enough bloons to cover all your bases there are two big issues in my eyes with attack mode its simply too easy to place one or two towers that can deal with the easy bloons at the start and save up the large amount of money to get the massive red blimp since this would still be relatively close to the start of the game theres no way you can defend against this and its normally a gameover its not always even a red bloon people can just flood you with a ton of bloons or even just higher level bloons you can defend against this more or less but depending on your setup it can easily overwhelm you this also leads to having to be very specific you have bloons to defend against these since youre only allowed three four towers the next big issue i see with attack mode is directly from the game once you get to around round thirtytwo they start sending an insane amount of powerful bloons at you this wouldnt be a problem if you actually had the finances map space or upgrades to actually deal with them but more often than not you just dont defense mode is just laughable in attack mode you start off with making two hundred and fifty after some amount of seconds defense mode only gives you seventy to start with that wouldnt be a problem if they adjusted the tower cost or the bloon difficulty but its exactly the same patterns as attack mode there are far too many bloons for the speed at which you can upgrade your bloons you can buy moneyperturn upgrades but the lowest tier gives you an extra two per turn for fifty thats a crazy amount of money when youre only getting seventy each time besides the two game modes there are lots of different events some of which are paytoplay they allow you to play special events once per day or you can get a membership to play it all the time you also do not have access to all towers and tower upgrades at the start you unlock the ability to purchase them by winning games you purchase them with coins in game which you can get either by paying with real money or various random methods in game this game is super great for playing with friends though unless you play against random people you wont have any towers or upgrades aside from the base ones you start out with its just super frustrating to play mainly because of the terrible balancing its free so id recommend trying it out for yourself and see what you think but as a good game i cannot really recommend it
early access reviewwell the game is what it is a 3d version of aqw the same simplistic mmorpg gameplay and the same monetization with guardian upgrade and currency you have to buy with real life money some stuff is lock behind the guardian and the special currency mostly been cosmetic boost that let you skip some of the sluggish grind and transformation than let you move faster than normal i can t recommend the game mostly because of the heavy grind to get anything but if you got time don t mind the grind or throwing money at them sure go ahead but personally all i can said is a okay game wait at least until it leave early access
i am never a great fan of the fourth edition mechanics in dungeons and dragons but neverwinter has managed to convience me that it works as an action rpg in a persistant mmo setting neverwinter is strongly based on the neverwinter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy mmorpg gameplay together with fresh tried and tested approach from star trek online and champions online while i am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like granado espada and maple story cryptics unique approach of astral diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players however i do question the motive and causality of making astral diaminds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place another feature borrowed from cryptics other games is the introduction of the foundary a virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy there are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players this feature is powerful enough to recreate entire dungeon and dragon modules written for table top play to exist in neverwinter like star trek online i am really cautious in approaching this game at this stage neverwinter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics but cryptic has demostrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem dungeons and drangons in the mmorpg market
in short pay to win game pay to get much better cards that can flat you out like truck hitting a bugits fun and gameplay really based on your own style however in order to win you need to have the best cards at least much better than your opponent so basically to obtain these cards manually is to use your own money or obtainable hardly thru ingame diamond currency obtainable it seems very unfair when someone has one or two better card than you easily destroys well planned strategy just because they have that one card no one has obtained point is you need very good card in order to win another player your basic or normal cards wont do but the thing is you can get those cards by pouring as much money as you want to obtain fast and easy cards then you can win against other players who have less good cards than yours in a word its a bit pay to win if you play for competitive mode against real players but if you play casually for fun or nostalgic visits this game might be good warning theres a difference when fighting versus npc and player there will be a huge gap fighing npc is like fighting a toddler who knows nothing and very straightforward whereas fighting real player is like you fighting a world championship ufc fighter where they use combos to beat you down and you cant do about it and because your gloves are made of cotton and his are made of spiky steel and will beat you down and you will be stunned all the way
where to begin the graphics are crap there isnt even an option to turn them up or down its just permalocked turdvision speaking of options character customization is absolute there are like two choices of hair and two choices of face both of which look as hell there are multiple bugs throught the game and they arent major except for the part where the mission youre on spontaneously termiantes and you cant move forward i was really looking forward to playing in the httyd universe and i understand that this is targeted at kids but cmon this is two thousand and fourteen this game plays like it just came out for the nintendo sixty four did you really release a game like this and expect no one to notice not to mension it takes so long for you to actually ride your beloved dragon i didnt even get to the point where i can actually ride it but i imagine it would be less like the movies and more like superman sixtyfour for anyone who remembers that game this should not be considered a complete game not even beta for that matter this is someone wiping there on a keyboard and somehow managing to write code that produces a barely functional program and deciding to publish his wipe exe to steam furthermore you have to pay to delete a character and there is only one character slot honestly wtf speaking of pay microtranactions microtransactions everywhere there is also a paid subscription option which unlocks for you an experience similar to that of eating turd flacored ice cream with sprinkles and caramel dont bother with this game
k just k the people that pay win its that simple in your early games you are gonna see people with upgrades and they will stomp you they will steal your soul you will cri you will die
why the would i need autoupdate in the region of the world where internet connection is drastically limited why the is there no option to disable any update for dcs world i purchased the game i have the right to play that version anywhere i want offline
im going to preface this by saying ive only played three mmos including this one and none for more than six hours i really wanted to like this as a huge forgotten realmsdd fan but the combat is truly dreadful and theres not enough detail from the onset to make me want to go further from a more technical aspect the graphics are mediocre but then they were obviosly set up to accomodate low end machines the audio is below par and the controls though not terrible couldbe mich better especially where the camera comes in to play
this game is probably the only mmo i have really enjoyed and have wanted to immerse myself in and it did just that the interface is spoton amazing i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys investing their time to complete loads of dungeons a friendly environment and a good character leveling up system especially a brilliant story im sure theres more that will be added to this review as i go through the game more and more otherwise gather some friends or siblings who love to game in this style and join the adventure its absolutely amazing
its amazing how every single patch they release the game just gets more ing broken not to mention ninety of the playerbase is toxic and dumb there will never be a time when this game is good stay the hell away from this trash oh and did i mention why tf did they give thoth a stun on his escape an escape that takes you from earth to neptune
early access review40 hour playtime builders reviewnote feel free to skip my backstory and head straight to the pros and consas someone who put a lot of time into minecraft a very similar game and stopped playing for a while after the project lost my interest creativerse did not really call to me at first after running out of steam for my usual casual multiplayers however i was coaxed into giving it a go it was either that or minecraft and there are only so many times one can redownload minecraft and optifine and get connected textures working with your desired aesthetic before you start to scream regardless of my hesitancy i jumped headfirst into a surprisingly pleasant few hours after giving myself some time to explore the world fighting mechanics power mining building and exploring all but one layer of the world i can safely say that creativerse is a step in the right direction for the block sandbox game genre especially where building is concerned ill focus on that aspect for my forty hour playtime review as i primarily craft and build in addition to being a fan of building and games i am also an artist with a background in graphic design if some of this comes across as more of an art critique or design notes that would be why hope fellow builders find this review helpfulpros lots of blocks to discover and craft all blocks can be rotated this includes furniture lighting etc unlockables crafted blocks are unlocked in crafting trees via discovering and crafting no guessing the recipes either the recipes are available in your crafting menu as long as you have unlocked that particular tree or picked up the recipe in a chest while exploring textures are beautifuly detailed seriously though check out some of the textures on the wiki from fancy diamond doors to subtle obsidian ore they really gave it their all in that department that being said im not comepletely satisfied with the textures and ill explain that in the cons sectionbiomes are very atmospheric and come with their own ambiance through the audio visuals and mechanics the dripping from the cave ceiling really gives splunking that extra boost of excitement biomes also have their own region specific creatures of both docile and hostile varieties mistakes honestly i feel like making mistakes and experimenting with building dont put as much of a dent on your mining tools and resources as playing around in minecraft survival does there are no pickaxes in creativerse instead you have a glove with different levels of mining cells they can be expensive to make but they last a lot longer cons crafting tree textures i love the crafting trees the system not the flora i love that crafting a block unlocks other recipes i do not however like how blocks of the same recipe class look next to each other wood for example has several block types that i would like to use together as the base of a build wood half slabs wood stairs wood walls the wood stairs are textured in a very high contrast way and are definitely in a different hue than the wood half slabs wood half slabs use a subtle wood floor texturing while the wood walls have very little texture at all together it looks like kind of weird mesh of textures like three different artists on three different projects designed them and set them side by side not a lot of textures look good next to each other and a lot of blocks feel high in contrast i have trouble getting particular builds to work especially when going for a rustic nordic feel obsidian to me is the biggest letdown i would have liked to use it as a darker metal framework for things but the block is too saturated and edging towards a dark purple instead of a more neutral feel that said the limestone tree has some goregeous blocks and i really enjoy building with those half slabs i thought half slabs in minecraft were the bane of my existence but surprisingly they do one simple thing that makes all the difference in the world comepared to these little buggers minecraft halfslabs stack on top of each other and creativerse half slabs dont this goes for any other block you attempt to place on a bottomset half slab in creativerse setting half slabs on the top half of the block space is super easy with the rotate function however not being able to put a halfslab down to fill the gap under a stair or to break up a repetative pattern in the wall is super annoying for building they are basically only good for crafting covering the floor and a few decoration touches very few comepared to if they stacked whats on fire torches cant catch trees on fire they cant catch wood on fire they cant catch me on fire but my hay roof went down in the blink of an eye why the gods were as displeased about the half slab discovery on my roof as i was apparently monster spawns monster spawning is a bit odd in this game ive seen rock lobsters on time out in 1x1 squares in the wall ive seen night pigsys falling from the heavens lighting up the night sky in their blue dying fire nearly every hour my friend and i have to play wheres the miru in our underground base because somewhere deep in the wall there is a 1x1 open space that a monster or two will spawn in a purr at us until we kill it and seal the hole more of a note than anything if you use too many natural blocks that have not being crafted after being mined there is a chance that monsters can spawn in that area my friends and i learned that the hard way after dying several times behind closed doors during bathroom breaks you have been warned conclusion all in all i have had fun in creativerse so far both as a builder and as an adventurer there are a lot of builds that i want to try in a lot of different biomes i have a lot of hope for this game its in early access still and my main complaints are just things that could build this good game into a great one if you have some time and you havent already give creativerse a shot especially if you are someone who enjoys unlocking materials and creating there are some bugs worth noting which i have detailed seperatedly in the steam discussion boards for creativerse but i have a feeling they will be fixed in due time hope this was helpful to fellow imaginative minds happy building
"if you are looking for online plane battles than stop looking this the game you want if you are deciding between world of warplanes and war thunder choose this it has better graphics better tech tree better flying better batles and its more realistic also the game is lots of fun nine thousand, nine hundred and ten"
early access reviewim preaching to the choir here i almost redownloaded this game after not playing for maybe a year i figured i would check the recent comments first since i saw that recently it had a ton of negative reviews needless to say im glad i didnt waste my time sad to see such a awesome concept of a game go to complete waste on this f2p marketing scheme i hope someone copies the concept of this game and succeeds greater than these fat cats ever couldve
"early access reviewno limit on blocks required for some guns makes the balance terrible if you enjoy one shotting someone from the sky while being unreachable this is for you if you enjoy tactical play avoid side note for items to be made the game requires you to sell recycle items you gain at the end of matches out of random loot boxes this wouldnt be so bad if the majority of the loot wasnt cubes that sell for one of the ingame currency even if you get a diamond box purple and gold loot sell for two hundred thousand, five hundred oh yeah top guns cost one hundred and forty two thousand of said currency per one this used to be such a good game i have around two thousands hours off steam via the standalone i downloaded it and played for a bit just to tell you all its complete"
love this game so many things you can do in it like fishing or fireball frenzy and you can train multiple dragons if you have diamonds i havent seen any bugs or glitches in the game as well if you love how to train your dragon you must get this game
easily gets outshined by other games too grindy the grind isnt rewarding quests are uninteresting and even annoying to complete the combat system and character customization are pretty rad dont know what else to say about this its a waste of time even if youre rich
planetside two is by no means perfect choppy performance sometimes and lag spikes but by the nine is it fun herrrruuuuuge battles in which each class plays an important role snipers take out dug in targets while calling out possible dangers light footsoldiers run around causing havoc heavys and maxs are the hard hitters whilst medics and engis keep the troops and vehicles going i feel this game can only get better
let me start by saying i used to frequent this location often the service is normally great and on any other day of the week i could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip however since the new change in management the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared i can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff to say the new waiters and chefs are unbearable is an understatement the new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children when my family and i went in this evening for dinner no one moved to greet or seat us until about fifteen minutes after we arrived i spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar i eventually cleared my throat and asked is it seat yourself today then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said actually no its not she proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us after scratching her in front of me my wife and our three children she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house looking at the menu i could see her greasy handprint remaining twenty minutes later a waitress approached us did not say a word started writing on her pad and then just walked away she came back five minutes later with five glasses of water none of which had ice she blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again five minutes after that another waitress came out this time she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening when we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff she assured us next time we come back we can expect better service she got us more menus wiped down the table and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table things finally seemed to start turning around after we placed our order we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant the carpets were new there was music playing and the tables when clean were quite comfortable for a moment we thought were in the clear just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve it was ruined again we heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff several people who sounded quite young were shouting do it do it immediately i was alarmed there were not many people seated at the restaurant i could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped the first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food all of them hiding a grin my wife looked alarmed my children were oblivious i said thank you but they didnt walk away my wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich but i stopped her i picked up it and opened it the three standing beside our table started looking nervoussomething wrong sir the second waitress askedi suppose were going to find out i responded i opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich most languages dont have the words to concisely describe the taste but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt i spat up the food immediately i stood up pushed the three aside grabbed my family and left the manager heard the commotion and made his way to us i cant believe myself but i simply gave him the middle finger right in front of my children and proceeded out of the restaurant in the car ride home i kept wincing at the aftertaste it was strangely familiar it was driving me crazy trying to think of what they might have put in it i considered going to the emergency room in case it was a poison of some sort i didnt go to see a doctor and felt fine after a shower and something to eat from home i longed for the old owner and staff i detested the vindictive people who were currently at that restaurant i wish the best for those old waiters and waitresses who got out of there while they could in the end the whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth but not nearly as bad as the one left by team fortress two
ok heres the real story yes you need a membership to hunt all animals but you can try the game for free and hunt muledeer with a rifle they give you for free if you like the game then fine you can order a thirty six or yearly memberships and its fairely cheep the bigger the memberhsip you order the more free stuff you get i ordered a six month membership and got everything i think id need to play forever in guns anyways if you have to collect everythign ingame yes it gets expensive but why do it a shotgun can hunt anything anything in game because it has three kinds of ammo there are fancy guns with ingraving for people who need those but never for free doh and several types of bows and arrows and sights scopes etc and on and on but you dont need all that for less than the cost of lottery tickets you can play all year long and hunt every animal you ever wanted in great detailed forests and on cold snowly mountains no its not all free but trying it out is so try it or leave it no problem but its a good game just not what many people hoped for
early access reviewthis game is really really good although it doesnt really bring anything new on the table it managed to create solid balance and interactions on its own and i would definitely recommend it as an alternative to mtg this game could be the next big tcg if more people were willing to try it
so bad its good the game is barely functioning though like i can mess around for a couple of minutes and get right to the edge of the map and climb up walls i wish i could add a screenshot as for the actual game its a p mediocre moneygrab
if you want to download this have in mind one game loads like five mins two connecting to server takes five mins three after you join someone kills you and you have to redo joining do not install this piece of crap game is just trash
early access reviewthis is actually on of if not the best ccg i have ever played lots of neat mechanics deck archetypes and a good pay model i can beat players who pay to win with a deck of cards i got for free havent spent a penny and had fun plus there are multiple ways to get whatever you need for new players a would reccomend forge to get some easy rares and legends
product received for freeearly access reviewwent from havings lots of money to almost nothing after the last update about eight million to the equivalent of just over about 200400k and thats being generous it takes sometime to grind it out too there was no point in completely changing what was already good and taking away my hard earned in game money do not play this game
early access reviewnot gonna write a long review although i have so much to talk about this game first ive played aqw for as long as i can remember from the beginning till the end of drakath and his thirteen chaos lord the thing that attracted me the most about aqw is exploration butt its a 2d game how can there be any exploration well some zones maps shops npcs chain quests etc that can only be accessed by doing certain things whether it is typing command doing a quest solving puzzles etc these coupled with the main story quest line really make an otherwise 2d world really feel alive and i just dont feel the same way about aq3d i really want to like this game ive been waiting for years but i just cant recommend it not at this state at least
early access reviewcompletely unplayableeverything is unbalancedpoorly optimizedeverything is unbalanced2000 ping after updateeverything is unbalancedi will continue to play but i cant recommend for competitive playersi know its still in alpha
early access reviewi might not get the timeline right havent played in a whilei am also a pure f2p in robocraft this game used to be epitome of a well balanced f2p game to me i hope freejam makes the game like that again ive been on and off lately but ive accumulated most of my hours before the dissappointing updates the developers brought us this game used to be my favorite only because of the game mechanics of creating robots and fighting with them i had many hours of fun playing well balanced battles with a great community i wasnt particularly good at the game but i still loved it then i left the game for almost a year and when i came back i was confused about the new system of weaponstier flatenning but i was fine with it as long as the game is still fun and not p2w i was around lvl80 out of one hundred at that time and i was saving up for a megabot the badass giant that gets all the medics then they removed it wow devs great now i grinded with my trusty little smg tank to go to wt used to be around tier eighty nine soon they started rapidly adding new weapons and systems which i didnt enjoy mostly because of balancing once i reached lvl100 they added the loot crate system which was really the final nail in the coffinrosefall he was the most subscribed youtuber who makes vids for this game and has left the game because of these updates moment of silence plz i decided to stick with the game because i saved up quite a bit of rp one thing i did enjoy at that time was that normal bots can have tx1 parts and having them doesnt bind you to only mega parts soon i built a very powerful smg tank with mega plates and t10 plates having a hefty amount of rp was the only reason i stayed in the game i played many battles and to be honest i was quite happy about the gameplay because i had a good bot after achieving lvl one hundred and twenty i decided that was enough a lot of robocraft players like to edit their bots when they get something new and i did that for every level that i achieved you gain ten cpu every level before one hundred and five cpu for every level after one hundred soon i reached some very high tiered battles and thats when i realized the balancing with normal bots with special shotgun telemport and mega weapons mega plasmas mega smg since these equipments costs an obsurd amount of rp and have somewhere around a thirteen chance of dropping in the most expensive crates few people have it thats where the developers got money hungry people who would buy premium acounts and all that will have better equipment and those special equipment they get really unbalance the game i was constantly in games with enemies using mega smgs and mega plasmas that can take down my t10 shield in one hit one hit wtf i was pissd off but i kept playing because i felt the game was still solid but after weeks of grinding without success for anything good i said thats it and i left the game i still loved the basic concept of the game but the moneyhungry developers ruined the game a few days ago i downloaded the game again because i wanted to see how the game is going and if there are improvements and i felt betrayed by the fact that the best robot ive ever built that ive used for hours cannot be used in battle because of cpu restrictions w tf it fit the restrictions perfectly before i dont know what update they made and i didnt want to know and i uninstalled overall i feel like this game had great potential but making a great game apparently wasnt the developerss goal this game is definitely still worth a try if you didnt know how much better the game was before the updates but i just cant stand the nonsense the devs put into this game i hope the devs realize what they have done to such a great f2p game and and do something about it this was my opinions on the game its f2p so you wont be losing much if you try it
most realistic flight simulator ever you will get confused about what does what in this game at first but you will learn what knobw and buttons to push after awhile you can even set the game to not worry about most of those knobs and buttons etc quick campaign is fun especially when you are playing in a tank etc i just wish the games ground units played a hell of a lot better though update this games rocks in vr
finally gotten to review this game almost four thousand hours of this game holy crap but imma drop the bomb here i gave this a thumbs down for a reason its current stagnation what i mean is valve has lost a bit of care with this game its a very strange game when it comes to the design over the years it is a completely different thing than what it was ten years ago originally that was awesome it was very unique and loaded with personality but now its a lost child abandoned in need of love and attention it isnt as bankable as csgo or dota anymore the updates have been awful radio silence from the devs it needs third party help and support badly in order to keep it alive valve must give development to the community or another company smissmass twenty eighteens was a horrible disappointment of an update adding terrible hats and doing nothing else i love this game still do but as of now the negative experiences in my near four thousand hours playing has outweighed my positive ones
"before playing this game take a look at all recent reviews and you will see they are more or less all negative and the only reason this game is on mixed is because this game used to be good this game has been in development for over five years and there is still huge amount of problems i will list just a few of them down below bad netcoding huge amount of bugsglitches that takes years to fix terrible optimized game end game pcs will have two hundred thousand, three hundred fps in the beginng of a match and once all the players spawn and get close to one another the end game pcs will drop down to six thousand and eighty fps on low graphics and medicore pcs will have one thousand, five hundred and forty fps insanely slow with the updates and when they finally do have an update it is just minor things like a new camouflage and a bunch of stupid balance changes that was unnecessary that nobody asked for unbalanced weaponstanksplanes and creditgold prices between the three factions insane grind even if you pay moneyunplayable for new players once they get out of the starting stage of the game because of the huge grind and veteran players will just instant kill them because of better badges weapons takes ages to find battles during the morningnight you will have to wait twenty minutes to find a battle people abuse game mechanics and reto dont care as long as the players abusing bring in the developers make the game worse by each update and all they think about is the if you dont have friends that already play this game you should not waste your time on this still in beta staged game the only reason this game is still not in beta is because the terms of service of steam prevented them you are only allowed to have a game that is under beta on steam for x amount of years or your game will get kicked out of the platform"
dont like the micromanagement it requires as its a originally for mobile if a few tweaks were to be made to timers and such for players on pc it would be a great time passer wont recommend it at this point but hopeful future updates will change my mind
great moba proseasy shop to learnoverall fun for new players and experienced oneesgods are familier and look niceauto build machanic that allows you to make the game do your builds so you dont have to touch the shop at all in gamelots of fun modesthe microtransations dont affect your charecters 3rd person so you can get closer to the actionconsmicro transactionsthe game modes can be boring at timesplaying one god for a very long time can be boring at times so buys the pack that gives you all the gods for free is a must side note although i dont have many hours on steam i have one hundred hours on console so my point is relitivly valid
a very fun game but the grind is rediculous ive been playing since the first day of ground forces and quite francly have given up ever getting to modern vehicles which is the only thing that tempts me to play the game the modern tanks are all over the trailers but dont kid your self unless you are prepared to spend hundreds of pounds you will never reach them so no i cant recomend this game not untill a massive reduction in grind time its a chame tho becasue the game is sound and fun and all the developers would have to do is too make an effort to reduce tyhe grind in a big way which could be as simple as the removal of silver lions or a massive and i mean massive reduction in research and lions costs i know the entire community agrees with me on this so i dont see why the devs arent smart enough too see that their game will die without it i mean just reed the recent reviews ffs all that needs to happen is some major changes to the grind and it they will gain the loyalty of the player base back and start getting the great reviews they got a few years ago again until then tho its a game not worth anyones time
early access reviewive only got two hundred and fourteen hours as i post this let me just say i dont play battle royale games very often i jumped on the pubg train for a minute but that was long ago this game is done right twentyone hours in three days this game is very fun for you and your friends the zipline is by far my most appreciated class that cap and the zipline distance is prettty insane combo anyways its free try it
im pretty new to the game but i just had to make a review thing that i rarely do first i want to talk about the community in my many years of playing video games i had rarely encountered such a friendly and welcoming community they embraced me from the beginning and they were really cool when we lost games because of my noobness which was quite often the devs work pretty close to the community most of them are big fans of their own game you will play with them quite often if you wanna team up or you have any questions just join the official discord the game is pretty cool too beautiful ships beautiful enviroment and plenty of pew pew and explosions you can get all the ships in the game quite fast just by playing the game no hidden stops or sneaky micro transactions you can get anything in the game with credits except the skins which still have a chance to drop from cargo boxes i got two this is the purest form of free to play that i have ever seen in a game especially in a moba this game is awesome not perfect dont get me wrong it still has some issues and it can be rough around the edges sometimes but you wont even notice it the community is awesome like i said but i still had one or two bad encounters morons are everywhere and you cant really avoid it but i used that lovely red report button its a game you should really try nothing to lose only to gain sorry for the horrible formatting and the huge block of text d
this game is great if youre nostalgic for yugioh and think you might want to try and play again but dont want to learn all of the modern meta and rules the game uses the speed duel format which makes it so the games only last about five minutes each despite having microtransactions the game doesnt really feel p2w to me because it absolutely showers you in gems sure you can buy a bunch of booster packs in order to farm particular cards though considering the usual price is one for a pack containing three cards it isnt really worth it constant events keep things interesting and i actually enjoy the pvp though keep in mind youre going to see a lot of cyber angel and ancient gear decks since thats just the current meta id say give this a try and see what you think
early access reviewpermanently banned for having a civil discussion about politics in the chat not even a warning or temporary ban apparently retomoto feels they are moral and political crusaders
ive been playing this games couple months maybe a year ago it was very fun yesterday i started it up again and could not believe myself how awful it gotdid not even spend more than an hour playing it will never play it again ever try it and youll know
fun game and unlike a lot of free to play games can be fully enjoyed without spending anything edit looking at this game some months later and i still think the real money aspect is completely optional not spending money does not this game any less fun sure you can spend some money but i feel i did that more to reward the devopler than to become op
early access reviewi can no longer say i enjoy this game the developers update it much too fast and take too many of the features we liked from the game adding new ones that made it unenjoyable unless they decide to revert it back to an earlier version or at least remove some of these godawful new features i can not recommend this game
early access reviewi am going to ignore all the technical issues with the game for this review for those things could be fixed the combat in bless is garbage for lack of a better term it was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is there are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion yet there is no such fun mobile movement in bless theres no dodge theres no blocking no teleporting nothing you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion the ranger class can dodge with a cool down of thirtyfive seconds beyond the combat bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours you kill things you collect things then you auto walk them back to turn them in rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon also all the story quests are instanced and theres no way to do them with friends similarly the first two dungeons are soloable so bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game also as im sure youve heard the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because youre not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing eventually you figure them out by trial and error people in the game are saying thats part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works but thats not what is happening here this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english if this is your type of challenge play a different mmo in a language you dont understand gear initially for the first thirty levels as far as i was willing to play you do not find armor save for in dungeons and even then you rarely get drops that are for your class basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that arent for you and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they arent close enough to bid on the item there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading maybe they will add trading later but this is just a minor annoyance anyway easily the worst mmo ive ever played most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign these listed above suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found without having to spend forty dollars by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left
nothing like dd in gameplay graphics are sort of ok but only because everything stays so zoomed out you cant see the lack of detail gameplay is a boring grindfest just like every other paytowin free korean mmo if you want something that plays like dd do turbines ddo the graphics are a bit dated but gameplay is truer to dd
early access reviewend game is missing servers are laggy you have to edit the game to get fps we were lied to you have to pay to revive at the same spot immediately you have to pay to tp to dungeons you queued for did i say the entire end game is missingnon existent
early access reviewthe game is great in single player great vehicles good for creativity howeverthe matchmaking queue sucks me my friends waited for an hour and we havent even been able to play the queue numbers kept going up and down
you just can not trust random people if you consider this to become your hobby know that you you willingly want to deal with stealing you thirty to sixty minutes compared to fpss oder singleplayergames you suck for your own and can improve however even if you you improve in dota you still will hardly notice that in every game since you get screwed once matched with unfriendly egomanic hatefilled people only play this with friends make a turn around dota if you are a casualgamer aswell
"not very beginner friendly ive spent two hundred and seventy dollars on this free to play game half of the money was spent on chests and most of the things i got from chests were avatars and voice packs extremely fun to play with friends great free game ive enjoyed almost every second of it parts i do not like about the game queue time is sometimes pretty crazy for some gamemodes loki is a fair and balenced piece of fairness that should go and stomp on legos and i cannot wait till baron samedi gets nerfed perfect free third person moba game nine thousand, nine hundred and ten fix loki or i will main him"
was a great game but then developers smoked some bad stuff i guess and so they started to release more and more updates which destroyed the whole game doesnt make fun anymore in my opinion but i still hope for updates whichwill make the game good again
after having spent enough time on it one thousand hours i can say i have mixed feeling with this game on the plus the idea of mixing rts map and your own units with a battle in the fps its great nothing i have seen before and the main strength of the game the weapon system and its improvements its addictive so you keep playing to unlock and improve some weaponsvehicles did i say how great is mixing a rts with fps on the minus the main problem id say is execution things in this game dont work as they should i will explain this the rts game is terrible the interface the performance the graphics everything is awful and slow you cannot group your units you cannot sort or search them the only way is micromanaging it doesnt matter what computer you have this will be laggy and slow it looks like it was designed by students ten years ago the game balance makes no sense at all the game is not realistic at all neither properly balanced so you find germans have the best weapons and then reto suddenly decides to improve their weapons with no explanation at all there are many examples regarding to this the lack of maps although there are several big maps after some days you will notice you are all the time playing the very same maps trough different lines but eighty of war game will be in town or mountain town two maps the engineperformance the graphics look old they cannot afford any comparison with any five years old game but even though the performance is laggy and bad i play it with gtx ten seventys and even sometimes the game is not smooth id say that developing your own engine with small resources is a huge mistake the stability is terrible i have never seen a game that needs to be restarted so many times every couple of hours you will have ctd no matter what the development policy is also total madness a perfect example there are four big maps although eighty of battles are played in only two you would think the first priority is creating new maps right no way reto will release new sounds new planes nonsense weapons modifications most of the time with no notice aka ninja update and many other useless things instead of maps tanks are a joke in this game i really dont know how to fix it but a tiger ii shouldnt be scared of every infantry soldier they see on a motorbike overall impressionwith all these defects issues and missmanagement heroes and generals its an exceptional game dont get me wrong the idea the core idea of playing an fps with your own troops and follow the progress in the rts is outstanding the problem is that is the only strong point of the game the implementation of it its really poor i would love to see this game managed by a more professionalbigger company i dont want to say reto is not professional but they are clearly short on resources so the game gets old unstable poor on performance unbalanced and their priorities makes no sense from my point of view i have to add that late changes done by reto are following a better direction and they finally implemented some really needed features like giving orders to several ats at the same time futurethis game will die soon i dont want it but i think it will happen i still have one year veteran people have a limited amount of patience and while reto mostly provide players with promises and poor results other games appear and they dont do the same mistakes i really hope this idea of fpsrts will be properly implemented by a big company they will make tons of money
early access reviewit has a pop up game launcher that always starts up whenever you turn on your computer ing annoying have to disable in startup apps why scumbag developers
i played both the original robocraft and the one currently available on steam the original one had and experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and lbocks with exp you earn after which you could buy these blocks with creddits you would earn or with money during the building of your bot your tier level would increase which would influance which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against battle were fought somewhere between ten v ten or twelve vs twelve but could be randomized like six vs nine depending on how strong the bots were battle was fought world of tanks style one life one enemy base one friendly base and go new version has different battle modes of which the main mode is a conquest based map with three different points to capture and respawn enabled there is no exp system and no tier system you have a maximum of two thousands points to use thats it blocks can be bought with points slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own dont know the numbers but seems like twenty or so of its original worth or with money they can also be earned with our all time favorite lootboxes now the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember really enjoying the old verison and to be fair although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round the new battle mode is still fun going around with bots building is still the same appart from the tiering stuf and its fun to build however what put me off was the ridiculous amount off i would describe it as rubbing it in that you are not currently a paying customer some examples when recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get four times as much dust if you were premium when opening lootboxes which you do get at a fair rate one hundred and twenty three a match you open eight blocks weapons etc off those you receive the bottom four the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying unlock with premium i would say i am resistent in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented but this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every ten minutes in short fun game went in the wrong direction still fun but not worth the trouble if you dont intend to get premmium
product received for freelooking for a game to compelety waste your life on well you found your maker bloons td battles is the absolute best way to do so considering the rounds can range from a couple minutes to hmmm i dont know days this game is actually pretty fun and its free sooo hecc yeah give it a shot
um dos melhores fps que já joguei team fortress two é uma escolha perfeita pra querer passar o tempo jogando um jogo de tiro o equilíbrio do jogo é sensacional todas as classes tem suas desvantagens e vantagens como suas armas também que deixam uma classe mais vulnerável a outra classe específica por exemplo o heavy pode ter bastante vantagem quanto a vida que possui a maior entre todas as classes com three hundred e ter uma metralhadora muito efetiva mas sua lentidão é evidente e é bastante vulnerável à facadas nas costas do spy e a headshots do sniper por ser um alvo fácil para ambos
early access reviewcombat doesnt make sense too linear some of the ccs aoes are hidden behind basic attacks makes it really hard for situational moves i like the idea but the way the skills have been set out just doesnt make sense to me the animations lock you in place for too long on almost every character im used to that on say a mage but ranger and warrior they should be mobile with at least dodge capabilities that will cancel an attack and get out of the way i wont mention the lag and optimisation as i would expect that to be fixed in the coming weeks as an early start to an early start fail such a shame its fixable though
early access reviewcant play the game servers are down please try again later neither the antivirus nor firewall is blocking the game if it works for me in the future i will edit this review edit turned off my firewall to play this game now im loving it https www youtube comwatch vzy6wod5mzy
early access revieweasily one of the best card games i have ever played i dont review any games but i can tell you this it is a great game i gave up hearthstone for this and have not looked back this is more of magic style game without being magic highly highly recommend
planetside two is one of the most impressive games i have played in terms of scale the maps or continents that you fight on are enormous and simulates a real war requiring both skill and strategy in order to be successful for a f2p game it is definitely worth a try saying this however planetside two has some frustrating flaws in ts presentation pros the game is huge in scale and beautiful in look large fights with platoons can be very fastpaced and exciting freeto play cons planetside two requires a decently strong computer to play and its scale can lead to a lot of travelling on foot just to get into a gunfight newcomers have very little room to improve and the game is easily dominated by those who have more experience certs the points with which you use to purchase upgrades take a long time to get and in order to unlock a gun you must play for a great deal of time lastly the any vehicle can quickly kill you which leads to many frustrating moments while playing
complete cash grab once there were four classes that you could play for free with others available to pay for with recent changes you have one class you can choose from and any past classes you might have leveled up were completely deleted and nothing returned a complete t game that is on the edge of being as as digital homicide games only difference is this actually works
this game took up so much of my life running the vault doing quests fighting off mole rats arranging love triangles fighting off more mole rats building weapons and fighting off rad scorpions avoid the ingame purchases and its well worth it
the new devs have done lots of good things for this game much better than when hammerpoint had control however still not everyones cup of tea but i find it quite addicting though it can be very frustrating at times dying from glitches
at first this game seems rather good i built a large vault and had many people in it however after i had sunk many hours into this game i came accross one flaw that ruins the game the fact that i cant go five minutes without radscopians raiders death claws mole rats and rad roaches attacking my base and harming my dwellers not only that but fires will randomly break out in completly empty rooms and these will usually spread to the rest of the vaukt where most of my dwellers will die
what could i say about team fortress that hasnt been said before its simply a great game not only is it free to play but it offers unique and fun gameplay characters and innovations that many games today lack
early access reviewdespite the long queues to get in and bad optimization the class i was playing berzerker is really satisfying and the game so far is a lot of fun as long as you dont mind the roughness of beta id reccomend to try the game
oh boy its that time againlets all say it in unison its a dlc plauged clone of minecraft i honestly would rather pay full price for a completed game or at least one that doesnt shove its own ads down your throat every ten seconds claiming to shave one seconds off of scratching your balls
this game plain and simple betrayed my trust what do i mean by that i picked up robocraft a while ago back in the days before there were walking mechs when there was a tech tree and i coudl feel myself progressing in the game i spent real money to gain access to a part i wanted to use and gain access to one of the premium robos that came with that purchase again this was way back in the day when it was all about building and protecting your captains chair making something unique that worked i had made myself a hovering ship in the same style as the floating ships in a mario game then the devs had an update not only did the update remove all of my progress thusfar it removed my robos and my premium ship that i paid real money to have and have access to i lost everythign when it updated but i decided to give it another chance and rebuild from the ground up this was the begining of a slippery slope of removal of progress updates that drastically altered the game and finally the death of what i thought was a unique and wonderful experience i played world of tanks for a long time about two years total before i picked up robocraft and the game felt more rewarding and interesting than both world of tanks and warthunder despite being in the same genre of game now the game is a husk of the creativity and interesting gameplay if you wanted to pick up robocraft now i couldnt reccomend it if you payed me it doesnt feel like you are making progress it doesnt feel like you can be successful with your own creation and worst of all it doesnt feel fun if the devs ever decide to make a seperate game that is more of the classic robocraft i would love to play it even pay for the experience of that again this game isnt gonna go out with a bang or with a graceful defeat in the likes of paragon the game will wither and that is a crime
early access review this game is in alpha give it time and it might be the next big thing i played the game for a bit and i actually enjoyed it the gunplay is better than fortnite like seriously its less rng people being people they would assume this is just a fortnite clone but me playing fortnite for a couple hours and experiencing how horrible the gunplay of that game has dont tell me to get good at that rng bs this game is actually pretty well made i hope in the future you add season events to make this game more interesting the graphics are nice and well optimized in my experience and while people are arguing about how their ping is horrible well this game just released this week and doesnt have most regions added but will be added in the future i hope i live in asia and i connect to eu and barely sense any lag tbh and its brilliant msg for the developers hirez this is a new game and it being a f2p game i hope you dont push the micro transactions like most f2p games do as what fortnite did they just made skins and didnt add p2w items to give the players that bought it an advantage over the f2ps i enjoyed the game even if i lose the match because of the teamwork envolved with it so dont take it away with overpowered bs that would destroy the flow of the game thanks for creating a battle royal game that i can run in five thousand and sixty fps and keep improving this game forgive any grammar errors due to english not being my first language
early access reviewim in a middle of a competitive game and all of a sudden out of nowhere this games launcher opens up right in the middle of a game like why its a stupid game anywaw just take it off of the store
early access reviewthey up this game this was better when they started it it just keeps getting worse i just went back to look at the game after a few months and it is still bad the game is even worse then beofre they shouldnt of chaged it i dont recommend this game to anyone
this and euro truck sim are my two favorite zen games its great to just sit back and learn to take apart and put back together all these different guns and vehicles and skeletons ive actually learned a little bit about the basic internal mechanisms of guns just from playing this to improve your world of guns experience get baked one thousand and ten chill
why this game better than pc version one good matchmakingtier one not facing tier four max tier twenty two no arty3 many tank have a same stat normal stat before they get nerf in pc ver4 you easly get premium tank in this game just when you lucky get it5 armor inspector
early access reviewthis really good just for begin games i really enjoied it and hopefully its get better and better like movement its something weird and other stuff but i really recommend this game
early access reviewthis game is amazing at first i did not know if i would like it because i am used to playing fortnite but after giving this game a chance i find myself playing this more
let me start off by saying this game is extremely unique and as such i cant find anything to compare it to as far as gameplay its simple at serface level jump in find a fight and take a point once you get into the technical parts of the game it becomes verry complex very fast with team work at the center of it all be ready to die alotthe games tutorial doesnt do the game justice as its long and uniformitive so youtube is your best friend progression can be grindy for new players as theirs no clear path to getting certs the games form of currancy but once a player gets past this hurtel is loads of fun
this is the best card game ive played and my new favorite unless the cyanide and happiness card game comes to pc somehow its got an incredible amount of tactical depth from being able to select an avatar from one of the elder scrolls races to affect how you collect cards as you progess through the game to being able to level up certain cards when youyour avatar levels up im eighteen battles into the story campaign and ive been presented with many story related options that gave me different cards based on the choices i made there are also many different types to the cards that are attributed to different stats as you play through the story or level up you unlock new decks that augment different play strategies based on the two main attributes that make up the deck in the deck editor you can pick up to two main attributes for your different decks what attributes you choose affect the types of cards you can put in those decks there are some duel class cards and a fair amount of neutral cards that dont belong to any attribute mostly monsters and dwemer constructs from what ive seen thus far but most cards belong to one attribute strength intelligence agility endurance and willpower each one provides more cards of that type that helps its playstyles as you level up for example a deck of strength and intelligence would likely have a lot of magic spells and creatures for intelligence and many that are focused on an aggressive playstyle in contrast a willpower and endurance deck would have a lot of smaller creatures and ways to augment them to be largertougher from the willpower and a lot of cards help you out more and more the longer the match goes on from the endurance theres also the fact that there are usually two lanes to the combat sometimes the lanes have special effects that change what happens to creatures in that lane for example theres a shadow lane that provides cover to creatures the first turn theyre placed so they cant be attacked by other creatures during that turn theres windy lanes that move a random creature from one lane to another and even an arena lane that gives a random item to any creature summoned to that lane with so many different variables and more being discovered every few matches this game is rapidly becoming one of my favorites edit you can only have up to seventy cards in your deckand a minimum of fifty cards a maximum of three copies of a card can be in your deck and some cards are legends ultra rare and you can only have one of those per deck excess cards can be trapped in soul gems and will give you a number of soul gems based on its rarity and how many there are of it you can then use those soul gems to soul summon cards you dont already have of course better cards have higher soul summon costs you can also collect gold from battles and use that gold to buy card packs or entry tickets to the arena battle up to ten opponents with a randomly drawn deck until you beat all ten or lose three timeschances for better than normal and more than normal prizes or you can save them up to purchase in game dlcthe dark brotherhood dlc appears to be able to be purchsed a la carte using ingame currencyyet another plus for the game in my opinion you can also earn more card packs in game through play and some of your cards have different paths they can be upgraded along
я считаю что дота вполне отличная игра отличный геймплей графика музыка радует донат который никак не влияет на игру а сделан для красоты мне всё в принципе понравилось но есть одно но нужно много часов потратить для изучения хода игры тактики и панмания действий всей команды включая тебя самого и следить за тактикой противника обидно то что люди начавшие играть начальных уровней буду сталкиваться с людьми не совсем понимающих действий происходящего и как никак в игре есть неодекваты которые есть в любом социуме в целом игра отличная главное не перебарщиватьнадеюсь вам понравился мой отзыв всем приятной игры спасибо за потраченное время
i found it verygood but it has no button to close it so i tried to get up but i was taped to my chair which i wondered how did that happen but when i tried to move my chair it was bolted to the ground and after that i looked out my window and i found out my house was in space so please do send help i have no idea where i am and i think im running out of oxygen i just hope my family finds this so they know what happend to me if you see this i love you all guys and i will miss you love thomas
very well made game the club system is completely broken though there needs to be a way to have people have the same level of power as the owner but not be able to kick the owner please fix this although they are a person who i can easily contact it still makes me very upset that this can still happen
i expected more form this game based on my expiriance playing wot pc battles are very very short no artillery limited options for gameplay etc all in all download wot pc if you can and youll be much happier
product received for freeearly access reviewafter coming back to the game after a few months it has changed very much from what i and what seems everyone else who first played it when it was released into early access remember the progression system was removed and replaced with a free chest system to unlock pieces but if you arent one for waiting you can purchase them and unlock even better things higher chance for things that are actually good i cant recommend this to anyone since the game isnt what i remember it to be that kept me playing it
early access reviewthis free2play battle royale has won me over it has snowboarding hand gliding mountain climbing and ziplining you can join a squad of up to four players play duo or solo pick your spawning point on the grid based map and your package of choice your objective is to survive the harsh cold you will be pushed around the map by a blizzard which will black out certain regions of the map which are randomly chosen so that no match can be predicted beforehand eventually there will be but one small space remaining and the numbers of players will have dwindled thin to all but the strongest and most evasive survivalists in these last moments before the blizzard completely engulfs the map the players have to fight for their seats aboard the escape helicopter teams will be at eachothers throats at this point as they all struggle to climb the ladder praying that they arent killed before comfortably claiming their seat one time i had almost claimed my seat and about one second before sitting down i was sniped it was agonizing yet the thrill this game delivers me in moments like that are just plain addictive when you do finally escape the blizzard that feeling of accomplishment is definitely there my fondest moment thus far was when my friend and i had both taken down two people each who had us cornered down in a three floor building the entire building was up in smoke and it was like a call of duty modern warfare campaign it was intense and as soon as i saw the silhouette of a person i unloaded with my origin twelve shotgun their buddy made the mistake of rushing to their aid and i downed him too we both were the last two players standing in the game and we claimed our seats and triumphantly escaped ive had many more satisfying experiences like this one and i could sit and name more but then this review would be absurdly long so let me just conclude by saying that the early access title ring of elysium is a game you will have a blast in and to me it feels like multiple games in one if you have friends play with them it will only enhance the experience tenfold i highly recommend ring of elysium with a nine hundred and ten and it is one of the few free2play games worth playing
its a very addictive and immersive game it requires strategic thinking and preplanning gameplay is relatively well balanced it would be better if you could enable better graphics on win10 versions similar to the pc version
every game have problems and new z clearly have a lot of them load screen bugs rendering delay fps drops bad optimization and sadly p2w but isnt for those reasons that i have to hate it like its hated i played war z infestation survivor stories a long time ago and one thing i know for sure new z doesnt deserve so much negative reviews like it is receiving of course my review it is based on my gameplay experience with the game its a funny game to play with friends or even solo some times doesnt exist one ing game in the world that you probably wouldnt pass through some bad times new z its a good game isnt perfect not even close but its a nice game dont deserve this whole hate6510
early access reviewi played about a year ago and it was fun and simple but now with all this fancy stuff the game just is not fun anymore i do not recomend this game sheepdog123
early access reviewgame is in early accesss for a reason all these negative reviews are from people who were expecting a full game on day 1alot of people are complaining about the tutorial where they get stuck equipping a skill cmon guys not that hard to figure it out i am enjoying the game has alot of content even at max level it wont take you one day to max out all your stats your gearyour pets stats and your mount stats so al these people complaining about their bein no content probably came from a fps game that you dont even need to level up try the game out up to you to really decide if you like it
you dont even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything youve built up i started a second game after getting a better understanding of the mechanics got an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward used training rooms to amp up the stats of my residents and how was i done in a single random group of burrowing mole rats made me burn through all of my stimpacks and killed over half of all my characters levels ranged from about five to twenty for an average of fifteen or so were talking about the second weakest enemies in the series besides radroaches here i swear on my honor and sanity during that same sequence that made me rage quit i had one vault dweller armed with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe had armorpiercing capabilities i uninstalled the game the second i quit so i cant confirm vs the last molerat in the vault fired about three to four vollys of shots and the the rat still killed him this would seem to suggest that standard enemies can get stronger if you dont meet some arbitrary gameplay milestones not that youd know given that the help section says nothing to that effect theres no level indicator for enemies and you also cant get a numerical value for their health or depending on the circumstances even a health bar i assume this because to get feral goul attacks in my previous run but i decided to wait on making babies to power level stats this time the final record for how long i lasted in the game before getting royally screwed was three goddamn days to clarify after the basics have been introduced and your vault population expands new training rooms that increase stats are unlocked this is because the only thing that leveling does is increase your characters health but said health increase is supposedly greater if the endurance stat is increased but just like everything else in this damn game theres absolutely no way to know what the hell impact its having let me just go over the things the game will never let you know the aforementioned extent to which endurance impacts health increase the numerical value of the characters health the default likelihood of anything happening when using the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or having a deathclaw randomly show up at your vault door what stat if any governs melee weapons effectiveness how closefar a character is from building up to a critical attack and with regards to rooms almost everything want to know to what extent merging rooms helps before spending money too bad want to know precisely to what extent increasing training room speed helps before spending thousands of caps to upgrade it too bad want to know if the help section aka bethesda is bsing you regarding training speed going faster with more people in the room well i sure as hell didnt notice any difference want to know whether you have the crafting resourcesrecipies necessary to make something in the later crafting menus before spending thousands of caps upgrading a weapon crafting room too badeven the radroaches can be completely absurd get like one stuck in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and itll be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be heard but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and five to six can turn into ten to twenty for no reason and one of the rooms is literally incapable of housing residents despite being a location enemies can spawn in and just to put the cherry on the garbage gameplay sundae your little vault minions could only be more incompetent if they shot themselves if an enemy walks into another room your poor helpless uberguard suffers from crippling depression that prevents himher from pursuing due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be dragged by you every single damn time but dont think that it ends there melee enemies on the other end of the room can still hit your sniperrifle weilding vaultdweller on the opposite side and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understands that if theres one thing that a timesensitive resourcedraining cluster f of a combat sequence needs its for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary locations within a room before actually opening fire or putting out a literal fire and on top of that human combatants will often stumble and stagger for what feels like an eon after loosing all their health dragging out the time that resources cant be produced for even longer thus putting you in the position of sitting there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of dramaqueen raiders drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dwellers being equally passive even as the sirens blare and the resource bar flashes like its actively being depleated i knew bethesda were hopelessly inept in most respects but i didnt think theyd find a way to screw up were giving you this for freethink thats the end of the bs nope if you look through the help section it turns out that the radio that can be used to attract people to your vault as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door opens has the capacity to bring deathclaws charging into the vault deathclaws and if my experience with the molerats and roaches is any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room never take any damage and somehow fill my computer with malware take money out of my account for microtransactions and give me cancer its never happened to me but again i only ever got as far as feral gouls so its probably a lategame thing with the gameplay being a mindless grindfest the only other possible asset is story which as one would naturally expect from a free game is nigh nonexistant in terms of being a source of sincere motiveation youre a vault and there are people in it the end oh there are quests that you can send vault dwellers out on assuming that you can spare any of them your valuable equipment and you build an overseer room even after all that youre rewarded with staring at a travel progress time for hours on end because it can take up to thirty hours likely more since the travel times seem to increase as the quests progress and i think i recall one having a thirtysix hour time to start with to get tofrom a location for one mission so good luck trying to stay invested in quests that have you sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for one or two lines of dialogue to give you any more story before making you do it all over again and on a personal note the game is an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because theres more incest than a southern probably should stop now before i violate steams guidelines regarding user posts before i finish that but the point is theres no amount of infamily screwing that cant occur in the game the weirdest thing is that the game actually kind of encourages it with the mechanics no im serious character names can repeat so its difficult to keep track of whos related to who and it takes hours for radio calls to bring people to your vault if they bring people to your vault that was one of the reasons i had only like thirty to forty characters for so long i was trying not get parents and siblings to get down with one another but with the way this game presents them youd think humans were mice or something anyway that was just a niggling aspect that bothered me the more substantive issue is the gameplay i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again if you havent played new vegas before then my question is what in the hell are you doing looking at bethesda to make a good fallout game go play new vegas instead id recommend wastland two but i havent played it yet though its in the same vein as fallout so i guess itd be worth a look
negatives one too many sniper rifles two same horrifyingly awful textures i dont even remember the old warz having textures this bad what happened three the footstep audio bubble is extremely small you cant hear someone walking around until youre right on top of them either that or footstep audio is extremely laggybugged4 foodwater isnt a concern whatsoever in this game5 still the same instantheal with meds which can make combat extremely unfair and cheesy healing over time the way h1z1 implemented healing makes combat fair its pure cheese in infestation6 still tons of cheaters pros one loot is great but they need to tone down sniper rifles2 still the same old warz combat which is good other than the instantheal from meds3 gear has stats now so we can actually see what damage damage resis gear has which is great its basically the same old warz just loot is a lot better although i dont know if thats only on beginner servers or what but the loot is currently great
this is by far the best game i ever played whoever says that tf2 is dying and is wrong because of one or two bad updates doesnt mean the game is and we as the community should know that and support valve for keeping alive this masterpiece but instead you just quiting the game because you are never happy with what you have
this game was my first mmo that got me in to mmos so i will say i was younger than now so i might have had a diffrent opnion if i played it now so this game to me was god amongst all its pvp is insane content nope but combat and skill system is some thing i would like to see in more mmos is it worth your time yes
early access reviewdont get me wrong but i absolutely love this game but there are specific issues i have with it for example to snipe someone is damn near impossible even if the scope is dead on the from twenty feet away and can we please get rid of the one hit pan it is so over powered and it completely ignores armor and they dont even have to be next to you sometimes the melee works from several feet away
would love to play the game some more but gameguard thinks everything on my computer is used to cheat somehow no amount of troubleshooting worked to get it running past the first time yet another victim of drm gone amok
thje game is fun but you have to buy stuff and everything is astral related so wahts the point with gold there is none really lol pvp really fun classes are a joy to play id rather have an option for a subciption or work to get the gear
was a good game some people like it now i personally hate most of the changes for balancing reasons inhibiting styles of play and the reduction of creativity so all the robots are samey now wait and keep in mind i have a lot of nostalgia from when i played the game and may be biased but thats whatever
early access reviewreally enjoying the game people need to understand that the servers were not going to be good at launch no mmo ever is im glad not all content isnt in right now mean they can tweak it all and release it when they feel like its ready one hundred and thirty founders and i dont regret it one bit
was not a fan the play is not as seemless as you would think and i never really felt like any of the battles had any effect on the big campaign i really tried to like this but was not a fan in the end the shooting and fighting part was sub par even compared to other ftp
its a minecraft clone im not going to say anything more on that subject because i feel its unnecessary if you dont like minecraft or clones of it then you be able to tell by the screenshots that you wont like this game and theres no point in complaining about something that was made so obvious yes thats a backhand to all the not recommended reviews complaining about it now if you do like minecraft and its clones or if you just like creative survival games like i do then i would definitely recommend the game its a pretty game and for how it looks it runs very wellim not someone with an ultraoverpowered pc but my crotchety old laptop can run it with decent frames its a little different from minecraft in terms of gameplay and progression and i think that makes it unique enough so as not to be essentially a duplicate of mc with different graphics it is something youll have to get used to if you come from playing mc though however despite being free to play you do have to pay to use a lot of features which i suppose is understandable but it does feel a bit deceiving consider this a free demo rather than a free game and youll be a little less disappointed by the number of premium features you have to pay for as it is you still get full gameplay out of the free version tldr if you like minecraft clones or survival games in general youll like this game and its still unique enough to be a different game from mcbut if you want the full list of features in the game be prepared to pay twenty for them and if you dont like mc clones why you even here bruh
okay so some people hate this game some love it so here are my thoughts the unique gameplay and artstylecharacter design is what truly holds this game together otherwise the advertising spamming insane microtransactions and onandoff lag would ruin it all so as youve probably figured out this is a top down shooter which as far as i know is pretty unique for a fantasy mmo this game is quite challenging it is a permadeath type game so if you die you must pick a new character and start completely over on the other hand it isnt terribly challenging as long as you play it smart there is also a hotkey command to bring you back to the safezone the permadeath can really turn you off especially if you have good items and was close to reaching level twenty reaching level twenty will unlock a new character class or two which is pretty much what keeps you playing this game also has a massive amount of enemies for you to fight many with different abilties which is also what makes this game unique id recommend everyone at least try this game you may hate it you may like it and let me just say i dont play this excessively its just something fun to play here and there also its a very tiny download and takes a few seconds its worth a try
if you play this game i hope your ready to die by more tanks than you can count and if your new you know whats great you cant kill the tanks so its endless amount of fun by dying to things you cant kill over and over and over
early access reviewthis game is one of the best f2p shooters in steam as it is not p2w but is easy to learn but hard to master like cs go i even bought the founders package that went on sale the only thing i want to complain about is ping as it is unstable especially in the sea server but overall its a great game and you should go and try it for yourself
this game is a joke right it in sucks the ai is agressive as hell they can slam into you even just slightly touch you and you spin outta control you can slam into them and they wont nudge half the veichales picutres when choosing dont ewven show up and the handling is disgusting just erase this game
want a game that is more diablo than diablo three is always thought hey wouldnt it be awesome if dark souls was a top down arpg i know you do and i know you have so why havent you played path of exile yet a while back they got rid of the three difficulties i thought it would be a crappy change but they went from four acts to ten acts in one update i dont miss the three difficulties at all this game gets new content and expansions faster than jimmy johns can deliver me a sandwich when i take a break from this game i always come back and go holy i was ninety done with this game now i am like ten done and that is awesome play this keep playing this and when you are done playing it they will shove a bajillion more maps into the game and add nine hundred and three thousand four hundred and fiftyfour more features and you have to go back you have no choice you have to that is how path of exile works it is the never ending game that is one hundred free why are you still reading this you should be downloading it thank you youre welcome
okay this is an edit to the original my opinion hasnt changed i still like the game the dev seems to be making improvements to the game things can go quickly or you have this nice drawn out space battle and just blow each other up which is what i like graphics are nice i love the detail of the ships mostly it seems like they took there time in that aspect overall still and eight out of ten i hope to see more people join up for the battles ok first i would like to say i have no idea how i got this game it just was in my library decided to install and go from there there is no tutorial but after a few matches you dont need one everything is kind of easy to learn i honestly believe this game would be even more awesome if there was no pay wall you can however earn things but simply playing the game it may take you longer but guess what if you got money get what you want overall i give the game an eight out of ten its fun fast paced sort of and its in space

early access reviewi started with this game before last patch it was good and funny as hell but after last patch its totaly gone everything that the game had different is gone hate it they totaly screw hole point of it never playing again see ya
early access reviewthis is an an amazing game and a different take on the genre sure there are still alot of things that need working but the concept is so amazing the game will never get old
you wanna good wwii combat simulator i am sure you do thats why you are here isnt it you want that game to be well balanced too right yes i am sure you doyou want a game with no nation bias of coursethen why the hell are you looking at war thunder seriously go play one of the red orchestra games they may not have planes and they may not be free but they are cheap and have really good tank gameplay that is both fun and balanced and still maintain historical accuracy in short basically everything war thunder is not the first thing you notice with war thunder is what i call the shell which is basically what you perceive the shell is probably the best part of war thunder the graphics are absolutely beautiful all the models for the tanks and planes are fully detailed down to every nook cranny and bolt but then you play the game the game is pretty fun at first but once you hit tier iiiii thats when the game starts to go down hill and that is when you really and i mean really start to notice something is incredibly wrong with the russian planestanks just to put it into perspective this is a true story by the way my tiger tank was unable to penetrate the front of a t34 at less than forty meters and he was directly in front of me he ended up killing me because the tiger really didnt have over one hundred mm thick armor and a ridculous gun thats just western propaganda according to gaijin i dont think they actually said that but it wouldnt suprise me if they did because that is their reasoning behind anything that is not russian being under powered another example would be the time i went into a head on fight with a yak9 in my typhoon mkib very historically accurate i know and naturally i killed him since four 20mm machine guns hurt but while his plane was a flaming and wingless wreck he managed to get one last cannon round out which caused both my wings and my tail to fall off and my plane was a flaming wreck just like his now that that is out of the way remember how i mentioned the shell well the shell is not really there for most people and while this problem has been delt with in the past it still exists but what is it well all those lush trees bushes and grass can just disappear if you go into the options menu and turn down your graphics and while on your screen you are very well camouflaged in your stug iii some russian guy across the map sees you with your pants down looking like a drooling idiot so how is the game developing you might ask well the devs are just adding content and not really fixing anything and the drooling middle schoolage masses that is the war thunder community is okay with this speaking of the community lets talk about them basically the type of brain youll be playing with are ones that are not developed enough to use logic and reason and if the match does not go in their way they will spam the chat all caps screaming at everyone who is still alive its to the point where reporting these people is usless since there is so many of them and gaijin doesnt do anything about them thats why they are too afraid to fix the bushes and trees problem they are too afraid to loose a handful of players there are so many more things i could go over but there are other reviews out there that will explain those things i failed to mention in greater detail than me i will end on this note i do not recommend war thunder to anyone there are so many promises that are unfulfilled it makes dayz look like a finished product and the sad part is this used to be a pretty good game but it has been on a steady decline ever since before they added tanks a couple years agowell goodbye my friends thank you for reading this review and i hope it helped
a good mmo for mangaanime fans w its fun and easy to play and has some good choices for classes it also has tons of items that can change how you look to others in the game from just the equipment to costume sets the skills you can learn for each class are aslo fun to use in combat
early access reviewi dont really like br games but this one i find it fun you got some classes every one with their signature weapons and multiple skills you can craft some good items on the points of control all in all it makes for a great action packed experience and you dont have to build dumb walls also for being early access its pretty good
i bouoght the original yeah the ripoff this is a copy of the same game with terrible microtransactions and horride graphics dont bother i wasted my life and money with this game dont repeat my mistakes
one of the best games of its genre truly worthy game which awaken my past excitements from the old days of diablo ii which i could replay infinitely graphics are a top notch gameplay is polished ingame talent system unique gear customizable beyond belief very much recommended to all fans of dungeon crawling
i really love these types of games ive played a lot and i feel i could easily sink a few hundred hours into this title pros great classes cool graphics easy to get into but with layers of complexity built in with formation strategies and placing toons in just the right spots and its great that it plays even if you log off so youre always making progress cons very very addictiveim really glad they added the game to steam because i think its great
do presentation in schooltopic is what inspires you mostpick memesdo a passionate speech about how memes inspire my dota playmy voice is shakingnobody says a word when i finishfeel extremely awkwardnobody really talks to me after class some girls gigglewhen i leave teacher holds me back and just quickly whispers i love memes toowe just smile at each other for some seconds before i leavei feel so alive right now
ive played long enough to form an educated opinion on the game its not enjoyable addicting yeah maybe to the right person but its an awful game from the ground up the game doesnt focus on nickel and diming you it focuses on pulling double and triple digits from you this game was designed for those japanese people who spend thousands on phone games and this is a phone game you can spend hundreds on a meta capable deck and if youre lucky it will be playable for a few months but its a complete waste of your money when a new banlist comes out every two or three decades people will throw their hands to the sky and say this is the best the game has ever been finally theres variety in decks do not listen to these people they are either ignorant or lying to you and themselves the game will very quickly tend towards a small handful of decks that beat everything else and thats to be expected it makes sense that there will be a handful of better decks but the problem is that after a certain point only those decks are played the exact same twenty card deck copied off duellinks gamea co and that means every game is decided by the coinflip konami is either too greedy to adjust the banlist to widen the meta or too stupid to add cards that would create variety i could go on and on about the fundamental problems this game and konami has dont spend money on this game do not play this game buying physical yugioh cards that you could win games and have fun with is much cheaper than buying digital lootboxes if you want to play yugioh for free go play ygopro percy or duelingbook
early access reviewprobably the best br game out on the market better than pubg cod wont mention that kids cartoon one thougame runs nice and smooth and i have experienced zero lag specs i79700k 1080ti11gig 32gigram 2tb ssdgun play feels really nicefreefreedid i mention its free
early access reviewok let me clear something with all of you the game as it is right now for me is not even a beta version it is so ungodly unfinished i could consider it as an alpha version more than anything i played the original aq df and aqw when i was younger but i did not expect a 3d version but here we are adventure quest 3d i forgot how sometimes nostalgia does not guaranty a good game and do not get me wrong change or upgrading is good but if it is done correctly at first i was happy and strangely excited to play it until i actually started the game for me was like having a kick on the balls just to see how bad everything looks moves controls and acts so if you are looking for a new mmo to try driven by nostalgia or even wanting to see what aq was all about ermmm i suggest you to skip this not worth your time
early access reviewseems like nothing kills a good game faster than game developers who simply dont care about the players who theyre designing the game for6man squads as if it wasnt hard enough getting twelve dedicated friends for a game like this oh and you cant group up to six people so its two randoms for your group who steal your loot at forge go rush six people with them and then lobby before you can even res them back from a unique class based battle royale to something a bit like fortnite without the building with more rng including random teammates if you want a full team so exciting not knowing whether youre going to be playing with illiterate adults or actual children and no ingame voice
the following review is from a vs heavy assault main no other classes except max are used by methis was the very first game where i started to use mouse keyboard oddly being plonked right into esamir biolabs no tutorial world for me c under new conglomerate assault this was where i realized three things a my aim sucked b i am not john rambo c what the fk thats unfair i shot him first after a quick revision of tactics a class change and using cover more often i gradually got a lot better sticking with my team and trying to be the main focus of enemy fire without dropping this was where i started to like the game a little more since i was so used to playing more laid back fps not ninety eight fpss graphics amazing lovely game visually when there arent nineteen snipers trying to pick you off ive not seen the graphics on any other setting other than its max but im sure it looks pretty on any but graphics isnt why i love the game gameplay the vehicles are designed extremely well each faction even has their own respective strengths and weaknesses that a player can use with their playstyle the weapons are different also for each faction with their respective strong points no bullet drop faster rate of fire etc with each weapon comes their modifications scopes silencers etc the game runs smooth when i shot an enemy it actually hits the enemy ive had no reason period to complain over stupidly large hitboxes vehicles are balanced and unlike most other games they dont suck bs when someone pulls out their lockon the warzone beautifully designed complex and various environments that have you changing your tactics or stalling your teams push for example a push toward the biolabs in vehicles can go stagnant with the actual assault on the biolab due to maxs being your only real support if you like being part of a huge assault force this game is for you i still suffer from whotoshootfirst syndrome and shoot all three targets to get no kill im getting better what i hate ill edit this out if i find a way to change it or get good but i hate how aircraft are piloted thats about it tldr if you like big fps fights where teamwork is key planetside two is the game oh dont think the medics are any brainier than battlefield medics when it comes to reviving you
early access reviewdo not buy the excuse of it being early access is a lie this game has been out for years in other regions and they improvedfixed none of the issues in fact they made it worse for starters i was so excited for bless online i really tried to enjoy it i really really tried in the end i ended up having to request a refund bless online is unplayable from the crashes to the fps issues and constant stuttering it is infuriating trying to get out of the starting zone this is if you can make it past the logincharacter select page without it freezing or having to close out multiple times and reopening the game despite all the technical and horrible translation issues the improved combat system is absolutely the worst there is such a huge delay on the combo abilities that the combat seems slow boring and more of a chore than anything i really do hope the developers actually buckle down and try again bless online has so much potential to be something amazing but until then ill find something else to pass the time
"the hunter let me start by saying that the ammount of hours ive accumulated on steam does not resemble my time ingame for i started playing before this game was on steam now to my opinion of the hunter its a free game in the sense that this free game lets you have a peak at the game before investing anything into it people these days expect everything for nothing this is not how it is sadly for those the hunter is an absolutely gorgeous game so far the best in simulating a real hunting enviroment you need patience skill and a good eye now to the oh so hated high price of the game if youre interested in the hunting part and not so much which weapon youre hunting withyou can lay down as little as one thousand, four hundred and ninety nine usd for three months of membership which allows you to do everything in the game and recieve the following guns twelve gauge single shot shotgun12 gauge pump action shotgun357 revolverand an assortment of clothing callers and scopes for your weapons the shotgun alone allows you to hunt every single animal in this game so summary of the price one thousand, four hundred and ninety nine gets you to the full game for three months"
early access reviewfirst of all i just want to say that everyone you see below me is right and totally and absolutely correct this game has gone so far south that it has managed to encompasses the globe enough times to reverse the earth rotation from its normal gravitational orbit of east to west and changed the course to north and south thereby effectively causing global warming okay but seriously though this game is so terrible that i cannot literally even begin to describe how bad this game has turned out to be without literally repeating what has already been said if you have not yet taken everyone else s word for it then please at least take mine i started playing this game last year and to be honest it was a heck of a lot of fun and all the things that people are talking about with play to win was well frankly not there and it was great skins for your soldiers and extra gun slots or commander perks all that was just as micro transactions were meant to be well simple pay if you wanted because you had the cash and as far as leveling up went it was just like any other regular fps such as call of duty or battlefield online easy simple and yes there was some grinding involved but it was never too far out of reach and unobtainable to the point that it was game breaking it was just play for fun leveling upbut now oh yes all the rumors are true they totally and completely and absolutely botched the system where now one hundred points per kill is definitely not going to cut it anymore to where just like in the old days you were leveling up at one hundred xp per kill and slashing though ranks like a boss you would watch your character go from private to major within a matter of no time and best part about it was it didn t feel like a chore there was no major grinding that was needed all you had to do was play a few casual games and boom there ya go wham bam thank you ma am and your ribbons were all caught up your guys was as previously stated a major just within a few hours or so of game play and it was fantazmastic now it s more like you have to put in one hundred hours not xp per week just to be able to level up and i get it game developers i totally get and understand that you don t want your game to be so super easy that everyone gets all the ribbons and rewards and achievements within a matter of days because if your game was that easy it would be where people could finish in a matter of weeks and leave your game then nobody would play anymore so i totally get and understand where you are coming from on that but to make the game so mind numbingly hard and grinding that just for me to even get to the next rank i would either have to shell out my soul for the cost of a premium account and again i get it you are a small developer so you need money or have to put in so many hours of work that i would never have to see the light of day again is pretty ridiculous so hopefully if the game developers read this then please please please i am begging you as well as many of us others just go back to the way it was there is nothing wrong with changing little things about a game like maybe adding extra guns or doing the paid subscriptiongold to make money but it should never have come to this so hopefully you guys will listen to us and actually hear us out on what we have to say as players thank you for your time of reading and sorry that it was so long if you felt like i wasted your time lol
i have only a few hours on this game and while i went with an open mind my first impresion are pretty bad the ui is akward and counterintuitive and the game doesnt bother to explain to much about its mechanics you could argue that you learn them over time but its hella frustrating doing even that however in spite of the crap ui the first few matches were okay everyone seemed to have the same gear semiautomatic rifles untill someone came around the corner with smg and just mow you down but hey i could get over it since it was just the lowly smg but than all of a sudden i was put in the same match with players with superior gear with one chance of winning a duel cause i was still stuck with the base rifle progresion is steep and its meant to be so to incentivise you to buy gold and get that nice gear i wanted to like this game but the ui unbalanced matchmaking ruined it for me
i have had this game for about two years now its really cool is this similar to minecraft yes is it minecraft no ive seen a lot of updates to the game and the way theyre taking the game is really interesting and fun
if u know how to play yugioh in ocgtcg youre good if not u gonna have a hard time in card rulings pvp sucks as opponent mod to win during event no japanese audio in steam version
this games tutorial is as much of a joke as its matchmaking and can only be adequately described as an infuriating sack of massochistic glee literally one of the worst gaming experiences i have ever subjected myself to and that includes the one that stabbed me repeatedly with pins
"early access reviewthis should be a good game and by all rights it is the gameplay is fun and the robot design mode usually works properly but there a few major problems worth mention there are a number of methods to get under the map and once there its a simple matter to wipe out the enemy team every ice map has somewhere to get underneath and its extremely frustrating to get destroyed and have the kill cam show the cheater sitting under the game on a huge sheet of ice that streaches the entire map the simple fix for this would be a killzone that streaches underneath insureing that when a cheater manages to get underground it would destroy them and respawn on a plus side ive only seen this on the ice maps some game modes have come and gone and while they were kind of nifty the game has changed to be more focused in thier absence however what was unacceptable was the removal of megabots the game has microtrasactions and to support the game i was having fun playing i purchased multiple megabots with us dollars a recent patch removed the megabots and gave nothing back the replaced power booster does nothing well ok full energy recharge takes eight seconds instead of ten seconds but youd never notice unless you took it to the test zone with a stop watch so its not in any way helpful the mega weapons take far too many flops to be placed on a regular bot since if you do itll take six million, one thousand, five hundred and fifteen pflops and then you still need a method of movement and chassis i requested a refund for the ten mega guns and four wheels and three hovers i bought with usd after spending forty worth of gc they returned two hundred and fifty unacceptable they let you return the mega parts back for the full rp nonpremium currency but you cant return them for gc and all of the cool vanity items are gc only i submitted a ticket about it but im not sure if it was anwsered because i have no idea where thier anwser would go for me to read it i dont even want the money back i just want my gc and i think its reasonable that if i bought them with gc i should get refunded gc tldrodd glitches in robot builder a number of cheaters and be careful what you spend you money on but otherwise awsome game with active devs worth playing but dont spend money in here until those issues are fixed"
early access reviewits fun with friends but thats about it it really only takes you a day or two of playing to get access to tanks and planes but then youre up against other people that have been playing longer or paid and have vehicles that stomp you as infantry its frustrating if no one on your team is playing as a pilot or tanker because it usually means that the entire team is nothing but bf109s dropping bombs on you when you spawn or tanks sniping you from across the map the matchmaking is atrocious in this regard not to mention how long it can take to get into a single match also i know its more of an arcade shooter but its absolutely ridiculous that i need to use an entire thompson magazine to kill a guy or any more than one or two shots from a boltaction rifle plus the recent timoshenko update is terrible the russians are horribly overpowered and youre pretty much guaranteed to lose against them their weapons and vehicles do way more damage than the americans or germans and the russians also get increased capture and spawn speeds then you even have the lack of initiative the developers are taking against hackers probably the worst of it all is there is shockingly little content for how long the game has been in development
early access reviewso far my favorite game graphics are beautiful controls are easy to use and unlike some people think its not pay to win even buying the most expensive ship doesnt mean you have a ship that better then someone using a starter ship thats one thing i love about this game
how to destroy worlds best game over years more precisely gun mettle updateask valve also as long as the pyro doesnt get a dramatic nerf this game is unplayable and rage inducing pyro totally ruins the games fun and skill fabric as it is designed for low intelligent and low skill players press wm1 to win
i played this game a lot on my phone so i can say that for yugioh fans this game can be fun at times as long as you build your deck carefully you get to play as a lot of characters from the anime though some of them i question as they dont really fit the whole legendary dulist catagoery kinda like bandit keith hes only been shown in a few episodes and frankly hes kinda underwhelming at best sure he uses machine type monsters but he also cheats at times just to steal a victory not really something a legendary dulist would do as for weevil underwood while having a few interesting cards of his own you can play around with hes also not much of a legendary dulist as bug brain also cheated a few times once by tossing all of yugi motos exodia cards off a boat they were on and for when he tried to fight against joey wheeler im actually surprised that we dont get to play as tristan taylor in this game as he had the 5headed dragon card as a boss monster and while some of his military themed cards werent the best he could be kinda fun to play around with other characters you wont be able to play as in the game i can think of off the bat chumley syruszane trusedale rubecca tyranno hassleberry atticus rhodes and even if he was for an event jesse anderson and maybe just for fun duke devlin this is also a good chance for the makers of the card game to look over some of the old archtypes in the game and give them some much needed updates like the neo spacians we need to have nex be more usable with the chaarcters shown on the card as it only affects a few of them it would also be nice if the normal battles we have with the npcs actually had some good card rewards as well as a list of cards we can look at when we battle them it can also be said that we can use more characters to play as even if some of them didnt do a whole lot in the anime or comics of which they are from overall the game can be fun at times just dont spend too much of your money on it unless its for the special sales they have every now and then all thats needed to make it better new cards for the old archtypes that havent been touched in a long time like the neo spacians i mentioned before or any other archtype that could really use some new cards to give them a much needed boost and relavance in competitive play as well as letting us in the game be able to use the banned cards outside of the pvp when dueling competitively as well as possible lifting the ban on some of the cards that dont really need a ban on them as the newer cards of today outside of this digital game well they can absolutely destroy some of the banned cards without much effort take a look at gaurdians for a moment and you can tell right away that they need some help as well as a certian spell card unbanned so that we can use the monster its supposed to let us use in the first place the same can be said for a few other archtypes as well other than that i suggest checking it out and hope that in time well be able to get some of the cards we really needed for the archtypes that caught our eyes but didnt have the tools needed to be useful on another note whatever you do dont use the auto duel function the a i for when youre set to auto duel can and will make so many mistakes it will fail to play certain cards that are in your hand that could of and would of given you a victory if it had just played them or at the very least gave you some breathing room in your duel against your opponent take any field spell card or magical mallet for example you have a good monster out on your side of the field and your opponent has two monsters out one of them being stronger than the other and yours unless you play the field spell you have a field spell card in your hand that can help you out the a i wont play it if youre in auto instead it was attack whatever it can and end your turn leaving you with a monster you could beaten if the a i was smart enough to play it first another example for magical mallet lets say you got a bad hand but have the spell card magical mallet to shuffle it all in your deck and get new cards if youre in auto duel the a i wont play it and just end your turn leaving you wide open for an attack that could very well lead to you losing before you even did anything
early access reviewadventurequest 3d will eventually become a great game as artix entertainment is focusing on it a lot hopefully the game keeps developing quickly and reaching its maximum potential
if you wanna play with just four skill slots limited skills you can buy skills or complete skill quests but the quests are long and tedious grinding which takes around two days worth of dungeon stamina to gather necessary materials be my guest as far as all the classes ive played each will only stand out and diss out dmg if you have enough skills to switch around quick slots are limited to thirty six with the transcendence patch pay to get more skills add in the only good thing about this is that you can relieve your stress on hacking monsters and critting them to death with full screen damage skill also enjoy watching combo counter on your screen rising thats the only thing satisfying for me sometimes you might run into people with classes with aoe skills you dont have and youd be like wtf i pick this class but thats ok you can always make a selfcomplain that classes are imba and the game is p2w or you would run into a badly design boss that would either two shot combo you to death and forced to use resurrection stones then you will wonder how to get more res stones then how to get this and that as you keep further progressing a notice of your inventory is full pops up or your pet is picky and wants el seeds or your stamina runs out or why you keep losing pvp or why pvp is so badly match tldr only play this if you have a clear goal of what you want to do with the game otherwise it would just be as good as any hack and slash genre play with your friends if you have any or good luck making friends with anyone in game lol p s skill slot extension is like ten last time i check you would rather spend that on some other things you like
world of guns what can i say im not a huge fan of guns but bigger fan of games to be honest so a long time ago ive started playing this game when it was a much smaller game at the time i liked it but it got boring so quickly because i couldnt have fun memorizing the parts that i was supposed to assamble so long story short i left it nowdays i came back to see what the developers did and made out of the game i was a little bit suprized when the game welcomed me as a newcomer because as i said i did played the game already so my progress whiped out oh well i personally left the game on the third gun i think so i wasnt that upset about it like the other ones who actually loved this game and spent hours of their lifetime assembling guns when i was searching for the next gun to check i was shocked how much models they created to assemble not minding the fact that i was only be able to play with two the tutorial one and an another oneso recommending this game would be missleading for those whos following my reviews because dear game developers making us players redo the tutorial is ok but whiping our progress and our achivements this is one of that kind of wound thats gonna remain in the hearts of your old fans forever
so tf2 eh this amazing idiotic and genuinely crazy fps is something set out from the crowd i can almost one hundred guarantee that you will not find a shooter game even perpetuously close to how insanic this game is with nine classes and probably about seventy unique weapons feb two thousand and sixteen you will never and i mean never become bored because of all the different class and weapon combinations be them stupidly over powered or just flat out derpy now you may say oh yea cs go is better because it has skins well no more because since the gun mettle and tough break updates came out all the stock weapons have atleast one reskin apart from a few things like the sapper and pdas with hundreds of community created content pieces and regular updates im sure team fortress two will stay popular for years to come ps valve we better get more free stuff on scream fortress and smissmas this year d
this is in the top two tcgs for me recently i switched to mtg arena from eternal but it is still a good game i have played all of the major tcgs hearthstone tes legends mtg arena other tcgs tes legends offers competitive premade decks that are affordable which would be helpful for this game as well mtg arena allows you to gain premium currency ingame without spending irl money through draft wins only tcg that allows you to do this that i know of eternal offers twitch drops which do something similar but no one wants to watch twitch streams for drops they want to play the game hearthstone lul good stuff free promo cards most singleplayer content of any tcg you keep the cards you draft this is also the case in mtg arena packs contain a lot of cards bad stuff if you dont log in during the time period for a promo you have to craft them to get them not available in packs too many cards for new players to learn four sets in standard promos cards from four campaigns i havent heard any plans to rotate sets draft only offers two base packs and two packs of the newest set which is good another set is coming december two thousand and eighteen campaigns are too expensive to reasonably afford without paying irl money getting campaigns with gold is also a waste as you can draft forty five times for the same price singleplayer forge mode is a lot worse than the multiplayer draft version single player rewards are a bit lacking in general no real reason or incentive to buy packs just rare draft or join a league draft is 5k gold for four packs and you can rare draft league is 125k gold for fourteen packs packs are 1k gold eachoverall would reccomend for singleplayer gameplay you are going to get destroyed online as a new player same as every other tcg ps pls add linux version
this game truely is one of the worst free to plays out there it has every horrible thing from every horrible free to play game there is you want to play only so much then you have to wait you want that tank cool play thirty games or pay some money you want another tank slot take two for in game currency then everything after that you have to pay real money for you want to pay some real money cool you get jack for it tldr bad free to play that all but requires real money transactions and you get every little for what you get even when you do pay
detailed guns and repetitive music creates a druglike atmosphere it made me feel like im a guncleaner for a mafia which gives you drugs as payment and make you work under music so that you hear no conversation very fun tho
early access reviewthats all as far as pros cons if the p2w isnt there and they make the changes on the above mention then yea it could possibly be good all the suff i mentioned is from the rebuilt version tho so i dunno i might play it if they fix the stuff and people are playing but itll be on the dl should you guys play it though yeah man why not aint else to play
is this game free to play yesis it easier than pc version yesis there less cancer in this version of tanks apart from arty everything else is the same teams t rng and cancerous tanks is this game playable yes but only if you are in a platoon with broken tanks overall not worth the headache just play something else
i want this game to be something but it really lacks in so many areas it has potential but to bring it up to speed is going to way too much work the devs might as well stop develloping it and start over graphics and sounds are numb and make the immeriveness quite ill the player movement feels like a cheap web browser based game or kind of like roblox wait times are quite high for such short and unrewarding andor satifyinghowever this game is free i would just say that the devs are very new to develloping
the game seems pretty cool but the problem is the ban system i started playing the game ten minutes ago and entered a server the chat was full of bans and i didnt understand i changed my server and i got auotomatically banned and idk why this needs some remaking in the game now i am permanently banned and i dont know why
have one hundred and fifty in this game with gear be deeply depressed buy one chaos chest to surpress your sad feelings get an item worth almost 300k money ingame buy best gear get bored twenty mins laterbest game
early access reviewoverall its a pretty cool game ive just started playing it a few days and im already hooked i play it any chance i get for being early access there is a lot of different game modes and maps to play if you havent tried it yet have at it and give the game a try you never know you might just like it i give the game a one thousand and ten rating
i need help it says program stopped working when i tried playing it like i press play and theres a startup screen then i try moving around and stuff by clicking on it then it says program has stopped working
early access reviewwhile i do think its a good idea that this type of game gets more attention this is not the game to get it well without about sixty eight months more work that is no actual story line trying to follow that leads to a dead end the only quests they seem to have fully worked out are ones that are boringly repetative or simply end in the middle lost of markers for things that are in dev in fact more than are anywhere near complete give it about six months as i plan to do then check in with it again as it stands though do not spend any money on this game make them actually produce a somewhat even for early acces this is respectable product that has put more money into play time developement rather than store purchases tldr cash sink with no real content
i spent three hundred then quit one thousand and ten btw i have wayyy more hours dont play on steam for less lag get the actual glyph launcher also the second video trailer atm says endless worlds although all worlds have a set limit well they are all islands and the ocean will you up if u go in it if you dont listen to me and decide to play im telling you now choose knight
this is the worst good game ive ever played the level fo detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible the fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof the fact that you can use machineguns as airbrakes the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are desctructible and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour the fact is however that literally everything about the game that isnt the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable everything above br 5ish takes millions of years to unlock even when playing with a premium account youre looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semimodern tank if you dont have parts and you get tracked you wont be able to move for the rest of the game whether you get to respawn or not is decided by how many spawn points youve earned you earn spawn points for killing the enemy so whatever side wins the initial engagement always wins the rest of the game if you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo you need to land on an air field and repair and refit i can count on one hand the amount of times ive had time to get back to the map after rtbing because the matches are incredibly short if your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to respawn you cant choose to not respawn because youll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points why dont you just spawn and die then because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money at midbr repairs get insanely expensive it is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money there hasnt been any changes to the above for the two years ive been playing
played this game alot before it came to steam an excellent choice for card game if youre looking for something fresh the lane rune and colour mechanics are all refreshing for the genre
best realistic combat sim out there ever dont waste your time buying the steam version go to their website make an account and get it there play the open beta and youll have access to things a long time before they come to steam idk why people are so obsessed with buying if its not on steam i dont play it get over it plus you get bonus credit to your account to use on later modules most of the do no recommend votes are because its steam related or regarding prices go to their website and get the sales they have if youre that picky this is the best combat sim out there and really has no reason for any negative reviews other than the potato pc users complain they cant run it yes it requires trackir of some sort yes it requires you to learn an aircraft to be good with it yes you need to have some sort of stick and rudder these are all things that should be standard if youre wanting to play this game go play fsx if you wanna fk around jump in fire up and do flybys all day these aircraft take years of development to get to working order and i have nothing but great things to say about this game
its perfect game for every hack and slash fans in my opinion this game have everything what diablo three doesnt have plot are a little bit short but for me it was exciting there are a few drawbacks like graphic or music which becomes tiresome and game play is a little bit hard for new players but we can expect everything from free too play game i recommend this game only for advanced players i really enjoy this title and i think a lot of people will agree with me
if you want a challenging mmo i would recommend this they upgraded the free to play feature as well so its more viable now every fight could be your last this isnt kiddie mode and is actually challenging
i like vano facton paly venu big facton strt at base play vano play go in to big room no windowns vanu facton rom has no windowns it shake up and don like no windowns shake up don like a mussle car dark room no windons shake up down like a big mussle carr vroom vroom no windons shake updon vanu facton room

welcome back to neverwinter is about to hit the fanthis is a mmogame set in the world of wizards of the coasts dungeons and dragons world in the area that they call neverwinter you start of in a standed ship and from there on you go into the capital of neverwinter to follow your quest and get new ones even though this is just another mmo game set in a medieval era style it is amazing i had a lot of fun playing this mmo and i really got the dungeons and dragons feel just as i have while playing the normal dd game the atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand for new and for experienced players the game has also other things that are better than most mmos for example in most mmos you just do your quest and level your character in dd neverwinter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do another great thing about this game is that the combat is more actionorientated you do not use a key to switch between your targets you really have to aim for them before you do your attack that is in my opinion much better next to that it doesnt really matter if you play this game alone or with friends one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing this story short it is amazing so just play this game
early access reviewits alpha so there are some bugs and occasionally latency issues that being said this game is already very fun and already has a ton of potential tried fornite hated the building played a lot of pubg fun for a while but playing thirty minutes not seeing anyone and then getting headshot by a guy that happened to be looking in your direction was pretty lame it is so refreshing to play a fast paced br game the fights feel like fights intense fast paced and dynamic
pros graphics while not a triplea next gen its still considerably good looking for the older ue3 they usecontrols uses typical fps wasd one four ability keys for a third person type of sub genre in mobasui while not the most insane ive seen its reasonably well made and easy to find what you needperformance runs very well even on max when using even a mid tier gaming riggameplay the game really does take the mobatpsarenafighter genres and mashes them wellpaymentmodel f2p as with all mobas smite is not pay to win but you can buy skins for real cons servers they can run great somedays and the next be dial up hosted in africas remote desertsbalance while not usually over the top some shortlong term balance issues can arisematchmaking can like most of the cons be or not be bad depending on your days luck community again willwont be toxic but my advice is keep to yourself say gg and leave the lobbymy advice is give it a go invite some buddies and mess around you might just stick around after ive spent two thousand hours in the game so far and many more off of steam since twenty twelves closed beta and havent actually spent even one penny on the game so if you find spending sixty usd or more for a triple a game that lasts two thousand and thirty hours till you uninstall a good deal then 2k hours without even using a single penny must make you explode in happiness
great game incredibly in depth passive skill tree that leads to great build diversity and lots of interesting unique items that can change the way you play the skill gems are a really interesting mechanic and with support gems you can play with them in some really fun ways
dota was my favorite in the last seventy eight years till the 700now i want to install wc3 and play dota1 again i guess that is my only chance to get the dota feeling again it is not dota since seven hundred they should change its name rip dota
used to like this game good concept brings people from across the world to duel too bad konami is a money hungry company their nick name is komoney for a reason1 random time limit loss eg you are winning are a turn away from winning with one hundred and fifty seconds left on the timer and you lose for no reason and a little message comes up lost due to time limit loss2 the fact that updates arent mandatory what game lets two different updates exist side by side in their game and play with eachother like wtf are you stupid three that time a couple months back when you could summon enemy controller spellcard as a monster4 drop hackers using modded apk5 meta that favours buying new boxes basically as soon as they come out the only useless box so far has been six samurai box6 free to play pay to win you can free play but you have to research what cards to get randomly buying a bunch of random packs will set you back in pvp where you will platue and you will be stuck playing against ai which is horrible cause pvp gives you access to card tickets and more rewards7 these problems existed from game start
in sparta ripepperoni revenant class nerfed valorous vial rip class unlocking rip made it harder to solo dungeons because of damned powerektrank we aint buying your pack mate111 would play again to get rekt
if you think this game is paytowin then you are most likely wrong about almost everything in this game is craftable there is no story at all and this game is mostly about dungeon hunting but 3d and kinda like minecraft
i was very patient and decided to give this game a try despite all the negativity surrounding it and unfortunately bless online is just not a good game this is a game that has been rereleased about thirty four times already and is running on an outdated engine that said this game runs like crap im talking about single digits in crowded areas and dips to 1020fps in uncrowded areas on all settings cranked up to max or one step below max four or five in fhd on a gtx nine hundred and eighty which is disappointing to say the least black desert online on remastered full pbr on shaders tons of post processing this is epicultra settings and its gorgeous in 1440p at at least 30fps on the same hardware i did mention that this game was rereleased after many failures so choosing to reuse the same exact engine and maps with their horrible optimization is not only inexcuseable it is a disgrace to game development what of the other aspects of the game the textures are okay in some parts of the game but relly ugly in other parts the starting area for the lupus is absolutely godawful looking the questing is abyssmal eighty of the quest is fly to this zone talk to that npc with the occasional kill quest and the combat rhythmic as its called is basically just single mob targetting with a two key combo spam its very boring and static and i nearly fell asleep trying to play the game i tried to diversify the gameplay by playing first as a lupus berserker then a sylvan elf archer but both played nearly the same with the exception that the archer can attack from a range but cannot dodge so its pretty pointless i can name a few redeeming qualities some of the assets of the game like the architecture is beautiful the capital city is breathtaking the environment is ugly though and looks like it was build using a free tool on the unreal asset store the character creator is also diverse and well made with millions of unique customiztions possible it doesnt allow for the level of customization of black deserts but i think its much better than bdos finally the ost composed by hans zimmer and his protege is great i find it hard to believe people would pay one hundred for a founders pack for this game let alone defend its scummy developers and really lackluster gameplay its funny that neowiz has basically shown us all that early access official release doesnt mean considering this game is not ready in fact its an early build of the game from another region it was released in eons ago so we are literally playing with junkyard scraps i might be able to take the game more seriously if they made much needed improvements like moving to unreal four or redoing the combt like their new title bless unleashed which was funded by gullible fanboys of this game but i wouldnt hold my breath i wouldnt be surprised if they ended support for the game before shuttering its online services altogether if bless unleashed is successful
early access reviewits so sad developers pull like this nowadays the current playerbase of robocraft will never know how good robocraft was before the devs just said f it and added all the crap thats currently in the game looting system p2w etc this game was a solid one thousand and ten a couple of years ago and now its just a stinking pile of money grabbing i thought freejam was better than this
cant walk outside your spawn without being shot by five different types of tanks untill you get a plane then you ram it into the tanks and your team hates you for wasting a plane and killing them one thousand and ten
early access reviewthis game is basically pay to win everything in this game is expensive and when you join a class it costs the same price to rejoin it if you leave when you join a session with tanks prepared to get spawn trapped by tanks because theyre insanely op also if you enjoy having no control over what you want in game planes no planes etc then this game is for youat the start it is very fun but then it turns to when you face the stronger soviets and have to play alongside cod and cs players who only give a about getting kills and dont give a rats about the objective overall this game will anger you and generally make you want to massacre your entire family while they sleep burn down the house to dispose of the evidence say you got out in a hurry when you smelled the smoke cry fake tears when the insurers come to rule out foul play and live the rest of your life with a unfertile mother named margaret and a priest called francis b10 so doesnt even deserve a number as a score
good game if you want to rage alot and suffer from stupid server lag all the time oh and also it seems like retomoto seems to favor the soviet faction cause they have way too op default camo they are practically invisible in the forests and in any vegetation conclusion you want to rage then this is the game to go for do not play germans i wasted over 100hrs grinding my german characters only to get them completely nerfed i actually spent money on this stupid game i have no idea how could ive been so dumb developers on any new ideas by the community crying about the game having to be reprogrammed completely all they do is add all updates and just rake money with both hands german faction is now dying thanks to all nerfs towards germans and buffs to soviets and usyea soviet and us fanboys keep crying about germans being op af theyre not even close to being as good as soviets and usnow there are close to no good players left in germans only 10yolds who just run towards tanks attempting to blow them up apparently heavy armored tanks get blown up by a few little at grenades wtf retoheavy tanks cost alot to spawn ingermans have weapons germans dont have good vehicles germans dont have this and that i could go on with this for the whole day but is easier to say that reto hates german faction i hope they realise that they are just on the game with those new useless dlcs like seriously veteran membership costs way too much for its useless boosts game has lag and performance issues and all they do is host those livestreams with new useless content that keeps getting worse they are clearly out of ideas who the fu asked for useles pocket pistols or whatever they are completely and utterly useless reto is by far the worst game company no community ideas are implemented noone in the support team gives a fu about the issues that players have they dont offer any good suggestions on how to fix the problem and they keep cranking out bad updates with tons of bugs and keep on nerfing germans with every update gg reto
"ive been playing the world of tanks series of games started out with normal world of tanks for the pc calling wotm for now for almost six years and wotb is quite a fun replacment i lost my interest in wotm because of the very broken artillary mechanic and yes i used the arty as well and found it quite broken although they claimed to have changed it but i am skeptical and when i was watching videos on wotb it had no arty in it whatsoever and i desided to try it out and i found it to be quite fun and i have been playing it nonstop ever sense pros smaller matches compaired to wotm means quicker grinding for tank lines and sometimes comical more chaotic battles new equipment system many players will disagree with my statements and that is fine and yes although the old equipment system was very good the new one is even better in my eyes and i will say at first i absolutly hated it the new system allows players to mount nine different equipment types on there tanks and all it takes is some grinding for spare parts many players think the old one is better most likely because all the needed to do was grind igc in game credits but it only allowed us to mount three equipment types total and some classes of tank such as tier five tanks wouldnt even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered namely the gun stabilizer which in the old system could only be mounted in tier eight tanks and now can be mounted on almost any tier tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles there are tons of tanks in here just like wotm bar arty if you want quick zippy deadly tanks go down light tank paths if you want a balance of power go for medium tanks if you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims go for tank destoryers and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor go for heavy tanks and as the game is still improving just like wotm more tanks are in the future good graphics and gameplay nothing much to say although they are not as hd as wotm for lowtomediumend systems somewhat like mine they are perfect but i am not into games for fancy graphics i play for gameplay cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches cons smaller matches compaired to wotm although it has its perks if you come from wotm you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the seven v seven spare parts system although the new equipment system is good i will say that the spare parts system is somewhat flawed we should at least earn one thousands spare parts for a victory and maybe two hundred and fifty for a loss ive only won about three hundred for a victory this makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying the only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions but these reset only every one thousand, two hundred and twenty four hours forgot which lol to be honest people the new equipment system really is awesome but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective update three hundred and ten claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle overpowered tanks although a somewhat realistic feature example a tiger ii in real life would blow away a sherman no problem many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are some notable tanks are the leopard light tank of tier five kv2 of tier six lttb of tier seven to name a few what makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal the leopard only had two varients built in real life so not much is known about it the kv2 in game can one shot anything at tier six and below when using the 152mm gun however in real life this thing couldnt even turn its turret when it was on a hill lttb reportedly broke its suspention when traveling over rough turrain the lttb is also a light tank and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor yet it has 90mm of hull armor i dont think it should be moving that fast perhaps why it failed in real life however these tanks are luckily not without flaws leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor kv2 has an insanely long reload upwords of twenty seconds and the lttb is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot there is also somewhat of a russian bias with this game and many of the russian tanks are quite overpowered and seemingly the german tanks are underpowered even though a real scenario would have the german tanks with the upper hand depending on the crew with a few exeptions on tanks luckily this bias isnt as great as it is in some games though and yes i am parcial to german tanks but i also use british american and russian so this is from personal experience the new millitary honor system absolute in my eyes ive been having some stability issues with my computer so sometimes my computer will crash during game play and i dont exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig luckily i might know the problem and am fixing it but because of this new millitary honor system youre honor stars go down because random players think youre botting or afking when you could have issues like i am experiencing in my eyes this system needs a major reworking or removal and my final and main issue with the game no three man platoons like normal wotm i understand that seven v seven might be difficult to have three man platoons but we need something cause two man platoons is just too small all i can really say about that honestly we should start a petition on wotb for three man platoons for those that agree with this another thing for new players is dont judge the game until youre at least at tier five and this goes for wotm as well ive seen too many people quit because they dont invest the time into learning this game its not just point and click and get a kill unless youre an old arty or kv2 then it sometime is there is tons of mechanics in the game for armor a skill called sidescraping and many other things that will help you survive in battle learn you tank too a panzer iv will have a completely different playstyle than a t1 heavy or kv1 these are all tier 5s too so not compairng two diffrent tiers use youtube for education and training and you might enjoy this game more note these are all my opinions ignore misspellings etc and that concludes this long winded review"
early access reviewhave a fair amount of time invested in the game played off and on for over a year now and enjoyed it early on but there are some things that have turned me off completely and the biggest of those is the ahole that work for freejam read for yourself then you decide if you want to help them be successful as i will never look at another game that this company makes aslong as d0uchebags like this work and speak for the company https twitter

my suggestionfirst of all is it worth it downloading it really is it is free and also small in size it is really addictive so i suggest you download it what do i do in this game it is a 2d fighter game in the online mode you can fight in 2v2s and 1v1s and also a free for all which can hold four people it is like a koth king of the hill game but with a twist every player has a damage bar the redder it is the more knockback the player takes it has alot of modes the main one is the one with stocks usually three stocks stocks lives you can also use thons of characters you need to buy them can i play with my friend yes you can if you want to host your own custom room you can play with seven other people but you cannot play ranked with more then two people overall rating nine hundred and ten i hope this helped a lot of you peace
because of assetto corsa i was very optimistic about indie racing simulators and this game was free so i thought id try it out it turns out its merely a freemium game with fullon microtransactions and you cant do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money its essentially the real racing three of computers except real racing three allows you to progress through the game without microtransactions and offers much more without paying a cent lets talk about the game itself the physics kinda work but the car feels slippery much like a bar of soap and the graphics are representative of a phone gameno not even real racing three looks much better especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best is it a bad game not necessarily im guessing the game is merely developing but i feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state definitely get assetto corsa instead it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this paytohavefun affair or if youre broke and need a free racing game id recommend trackmania nations forever which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer or even the demo of grid two which has online multiplayer
early access reviewgreat game like the fact that its not all about having ninja like reflexes if you got a brain learn the maps and get experience you are going to own all the cs gokids
great realism detailed terrain loads of different aircraft to fly lots of ground forces to obliterate easy to joinmake servers and fly with others extensive mission editor interactive tutorials definitely would recommend having a good joystickhotas setup helps a lot but even with a simple joystick its playable
i would love this game so much if only i could control it seriously im not sure if its just me but everytime i play this game i can control my character for a minute then for whatever reason i no longer control my character my character just goes where ever the which often ends with death making it impossible to proceed to the next class in this game they need to fix this because at the moment its impossible to play until this is fixed this isnt getting any thumbs up from me
early access reviewits okay not great try aqw its better and if you dont like 2d play a wow ripoff there are hundreds of them or try rift if you arent specifically looking for free try tsw the secret world or wow both are pretty good or try trove or something but give this a try its okay
early access reviewremember that time when you were playing a game and thought that this game needs a lot more mindless action and fighting so now you have it and you dont even need to pay for it review legends the legends have repetitive weapons but each one of them have their own unique skills with them but unfortunally there as always those guys spamming spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena the legends are completly freeomoney you just need to play a lot to buy the one you want the game has a weekly rotation of legends so you can play with em all without even buying them arenas the arenas are kinda simple with some of them that actually has some feature or other the game itself got kinda of seventy eight arenas but they all could get an upgrade and new features all the arenas are spearspamming friendly but with the right momentum you can just tell the sheethead to go away with a punch in his head skins the game gives you the oportunity to have all the legends with only playing the game but the skins just with mammoth coins translating real cash i kinda think this is good because you will only buy the ones you like for the ones you play but there should be another way to get them not like csgo with crates and sheet but kinda a presential month listing that if you get all days ingame you could trade for a skin buuuut thats just me gameplay consist of the couch the single player the online and the ranked the cool part of them all is not that you just play by yourself this game brings back the good ol samescreen coop gameplay meaning you can add more than one player in one pc for me this is actually awesome the game consist in killing everybody else in the arena be it in teams or f4a freeforall all legends have two weapons and can still just brawl their brains out with their fists end for all of you whom are reluctant to play this i shall tell you lets freaking explode their brains with freaking massive rocket spears9510
i left this game in my library for months in the hopes that the payment system would change as i loved the games graphics and openworld feel when i first played it so long ago yet here i am many months later writing this review still uses a ridiculous subscriptionbased paywall system if they ever add a system that allows you to progress without having to bring in a dump truck filled to the brim with wads of cash i might leave a good review but for now its probably best that i finally delete this from my library
i used to love this game if you want to play a game thats dying and gives you fun until you die due to hackers then be my guest im not going to go off on a rage againts kabam and them buying the game because honestly i know theyre moneyhungry but who isnt â â â â â â i would milk the â â â â out of this game until the money runs out because i would be surprised if this game lasts another year or two
"early access reviewa great experience been since the start proud to be part of this idea working hard on some balances going back and forth on changes listening to community and keeping the game updated will definitely be a great release once they finish tuning extreme imbalances between classes ps the new update for seven million, forty two thousand and eighteen made the game kinda annoying on solo missions with grown hp the rest is just greatgood fun mostly in co op games soloing gets boring after a few victories and shenanigans"
early access reviewit was a perfect game nothing was messed up and no matter how each update messed up the game it wasnt that bad then this new epic loot update dropped and everything went to hell guns fire at stupid slow speed weapon damage balances got screwed and most of all when you buy in game boxes with real money they dont show up and get lost in the system it is definitely very disappointing so see a game that was so much fun at twenty fourteens get messed up so badly by just one update i think my outmost verdict of this game is that good ol freejam finally broke the game so badly that to save it they have to roll back the entire update guess it was a matter of time as freejam has been breaking this game for quite some time
early access reviewthis is my official review of adventure quest 3d a game by ae artix entertainment for pc and mobile this is a giant pile of i dont know how it could of possibly been made worse than adventure quest worlds but you managed so congratulations artix i have expierenced alot of mmos but with a bad and clunky combat system like this really bad player systems which could be easily exploited and just an utter and boring grindfest to the point where to even ing play the game you need to turn off your brain and put it into robot mode it becomes a bit annoying to say the least maybe the first five minutes wasenjoyable after that nothing the combat in the game has four classes which one is for founders only warrior rogue mage guardian for founders all of these classes have five basic moves that cant be upgraded orchanged at all and are boring basic unoriginal abilities that can be from almost any mmo or any kind of rpg game by the way the one ability is your basic attack so theres technically 4its also point and click targeted combat which isnt bad but its so clunky and just boring to where you can just sit there spamming two abilities that you prefer and win without even havingto think about it removes any challenge from a game which is something that a game needs to be entertaining in my opinion also the game is a total grindfest there is nothing to do other than kill monsters ninety nine of the quests are killing monsters too you figure theyd at least do one thing in this game justice but they really didnt for exploiting all you got to do is go intohigh level areas accept a quest because theres no level or any kind of restriction to accepting quests and walk over and hit a monster once that someone else is attacking run awayand youll get exp when it dies rinse and repeat the variation of clothingarmor in the game there are very few and then a bunch of others which are recolors of the very fewoh and did i mention to craft them you got to go to a crafting person make sure you have the materials then spend gold to craft your item and that it also has a crafting time you can spend real life money to decrease the crafting time seriously this game is utter garbage to think this came from the creator of the orignial adventure quest is really sad andthe fact that this was released in twenty seventeens is honesty laughable it feels like a ripoff of a ripoff if you enjoy brainless grindfests then pick this game up if not steer away two hundred and ten
early access reviewrecommended to me by a friend he said that he got it a year ago and it was barely playable back then but now its pretty awesome as far as im concerned its a bit like league of legends meets eve online without the â one hundred a year subscription the graphics look pretty sweet and theres no evidence of pay to win which is great its more pay to get something that looks cool but is really difficult to use and theres a nonpremium version of the vehicle anyway so yeah really nice and fair despite me struggling at the game because its very heavily tactics based and i struggle with working with a team over the internet p still best purchase of twenty sixteens in my opinion actually no best purchase ive made on steam for a very long time buy it buy it but it three
early access reviewthis is a game that almost manages to look worse then it runs almost questing boring and level gaps where you have to grind x of mobs to fill exp in order to move to next quest chain and grind the very same solo dungeon seemingly endlessly but hey theres cool dungeon traps besides the game itself being a trappremium bonus your founders pack has junk that only lasts thirty days including the skins for mounts gathering besides there being maybe four graphics between what nodes look like you also have to buy harvesting tools which expire per harvest like gw2 and it takes too long maybe helped by better tools though still annoyingcharacter creation very fun classes limited as of right now there are only four playable with warlock and mystic being locked bummer combat about as fun as tab targeting the wrong mob that instantly respawns and pressing one r r t one y y t while strafing so you dont get murdered by other things that instantly respawn controller not supportedskill tree holy crap convoluted and unforgiving while also not really giving you a whole lot of variety especially at low levels nothing is new its just recycled abilities from most the classes youd find in a game like wow which is standard in most mmos however having a limited action bar makes everything rely on combos which each ability gets leveled with gems you earn from leveling and each ability seems to have a limited amount of combo sets youll probably just use what you start with level that and not even touch anything else because it will be too expensive to experiment
early access reviewman oh man this game has some serious potential and i do believe artix entertainment will fulfill every bit of it in making aq3d i followed this game back when it was just an idea that had a few posts about it and ever since then ive always had hope for this to be a thing i myself had played and upgraded in all of artix entertainments games i actually started pc gaming as a whole around the same time i began playing their games back in early two thousand and seven ive enjoyed every single game they developed and i can guarantee that this will be no exception as of now this game is worthy enough to invest numerous hours into and its only in early access dont look at my hours i played before aq3d was even greenlit on steam so if you get the chance play this game you wont regret it
unbalanced game the british tanks in the middle of the research are mostly after ii worldwar tanks and the soviet ii worldwar tanks can use afterwar ammunition the british tanks in tier four have antitanks rockets and on the german side you have only tiger and panther no chancein the beginning it was a good game on the moment it is only pay and win tactic
game is good considering you can get free gems just but not playing the game after a couple of months then you can go back into the game and get the free gems cause of the events in your mail even if you havent played for a while yes if you use irl your going to get better cards faster but it doesnt matter the fact that you can even get free gems after a while of not playing the game just log in now and then and they will give you free gems in your mailbox
early access reviewway better than fortnite in every way compared to pubg though tough to say as of writing this i have only played a few matches but absolutely loved it so far will update later but it is free if your pc can run it just try it out and stop wasting your time reading reviews
ive been playing this game since its first release the game back then was awful i m not going to lie although through the years of playing this game there have been many different releases and failed attempts to make this game good this version of the game on the other hand i have very little to complain about this is the only version that has hackers somewhat under control and is actively trying to work and make this game great give this game a chance and support the game like i said i ve been playing this version before the steam version was even released and it has improved ten fold this game will continue to improve and i hope it will be successful i highly recommend this game to anyone

early access reviewgood old artix entertainment is at it again releasing an unfinished game and seeing what comes out of it its fun though play it casually on your phone or something dont take it too seriously and youll enjoy it
its freetoplay very fullfeatured and a ton of fun if you like fantasy mmos uses the dungeons dragons fourth edition rules which actually work a lot better as a computer game than they do in the pen paper game the combat is surprsingly robust much more interactive than in a typical mmo it uses reticule targeting rather than tab targeting and thats a lot more interesting the big bonus is the builtin foundry editor which allows any user to create their own quests so theres a huge amount of user generated content some of it very good indeed overall its currently my goto mmo and i recommend it highly
mostly like hearthstone but they brought in an interruptinstant mechanic which slows stuff down immensely and requires everyone to always pay attention when its not their turn avoiding that at all costs no matter how difficult it was to keep the game deep was perhaps the genius masterstroke of hearthstone and its completely baffling that legends would try to turn back the clock on that normally this wouldnt be so much of a dealbreaker but legends is so similar to hearthstone in design that it forces comparison and must necessarily beat hearthstone at its own game which it doesnt
early access reviewwhen i saw this on the upcoming games i didnt know what to expect but this must be the best jumpscare game i ever played really this must be the only game where you can get scared with cute cardbox cut outs and there are so many references to other horror games its really nice to see all of them right now i am in room four hundred after almost died because a cute jelly cardbox popped out the wall while i was being chased and let go of my mouse because of the shock this is way better than any game where you just sit there waiting to get scared one thousand and ten
good game even with the card that you cant get unless you pay the meta still one hundred free you can go to the top just using free things the events are pretty constant too so you dont get bored too easily
early access reviewthose guys saying this game is p2w t havent you played aqw i already know its gonna be p2w but you can still have fun what i dont like now the exp so low and there is no map also the quests are too hard or long im still level five but the quests required two thousand and thirty kills please fix it
this is the best fps game out there im many ways it has literally hundreds of players fighting across several whole continents massive tank battles fifty player dogfights and so much more the progression system is sometimes tedious especially when you stop getting the one hundred cert rank bonus but it does prioritize teamwork the biggest and most important thing to do as soon as you can is to join an outfit i am a proud member of the phoenix battalion nc east coast server and have served in several of the largest battles so far being with a group of well organised well led players is one of the best things about his game it is amazing and even better its free get it
its like someone out there decided to just make an excellent game release it for free and then the only money involved is cosmetics and absolutely zero pay to win aspects kept it updated balanced and added neat seasonal intrigue and ladders and rankings and then actually did everything i just said
well ive been playing this game till level five and my experience so far has been like this pros the graphics are pretty decentcombat system is pretty coolmovement is smooth and nice cons frame drops almost every tenth secondduring video sequences the audio comes later than the actual video which makes it pretty stupid and hilariousi got a high end pc but the game is really bad optimized that im sitting on five thousand and sixty frames all the time for now i do not recommend the game to anyone a game like this should have been optimized before the actual release but does it have potential hell yes
once this was a promising game but the developers have driven it into the abyss too many changes in the gameplay and no proper roadmap made the game a sandbox for the developers the performance is not satisfactory and the networking is modest too so if you like a dead game with performance problems and no future then this is just what you are looking for they had a roadmaps but changing the whole game is not like updates should be
"product received for freei recommend this game for short plays but in the long run it may not be worth it i have four hundred hours and it wasnt really worth my whileedit 7152018over nine hundred hours now but i stopped playing time to time it is a fun and addictive game without a doubt its just when you hit that level ninety you will be grinding for exp and having really good gear is essential to delete the mobs before they chip 110hp to 14hp every time you get caught having potionsfoodsitem eventsetc is always needed for underpowered gear the most op players you see are the ones that played over a few thousands of hours into the game to get very strong gear majority of dedicated players and theres takers including me that gear is below nine and put few to none effort for dedicated daily weekly monthly grinding for the best gear bank trial and error events and skil stacking stats even tho i have over nine hundred hours i mostly just hang around play events try all characters and some grind here and there at most i spent fifty in this game to speed up third job quest bank share and rewards to other players that i promised gg its been a fun odd crazy ride for three years i may jump back maybe in a long time and one more thing i accidentally burned one hundred us dollors for a ingame player so i told him to gift me costume sets for rena and ashia stats of the costume are not worth and is was valued twenty five thirty us dollors for a freaken setpay to win s just a allusion for nonveterens real money only gives costumes less time for class job grinding and few bonus stats the real power comes from knowing the game system by heart and freaken dedication involving alot of trial and error when the odd are greatly against achieving level ninetynine peeps and gearspeople with nine are the unlucky climbing playerspeople with ten are the unlucky dedicated playerspeople with eleven grinding carriesanyone with twelve the richest of playgrind to win becomes work13 the chosen ones of pve for massive love for the game edit nine million, one hundred and twelve thousand and eighteen still playing and achived one thousand hours of play time for steam record now over two hundred and fifty in this game so far"
a great oldschool mmorpg it still has high system requirements but most shouldnt have a problem with it it is a gorgeous game with very indepth lore you cant get any better than that for old school either
when this game first came out it was amazing so much do it in the game but thats when the game first came out whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours ill go into more detail on the cons near the end pros great fun with friends if youre all new to the gamethe massive range of items in the gamehow they submit workshop creations into the gamethey keep updating this game and adding more content e g new classesthis game is free two playcons the grinding in this game is stupidly longingame purchasesquickly gets boring if youre a casual playerokay the reason why im not going to be going into the pros into more detail as theyre self explained from my view but ill be going over the cons as quite a large range of people whove played this game have encountered this problem as i have first con the grinding if youre a casual player as i am when it comes to this game youll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is this con is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end okay once you start this game youll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first four hours in youll notice on how material youll need for your new weapon to upgrade but youll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid second con with the ingame purchases this is completely optional but what the ingame purchases give you are quite stupid but the ingame purchases you dont have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why youll see alot of reviews saying pay two play in my opinion i dont see the game as pay two play as i havent spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from third con if youre a casual player like me youll notice on how bored youll quickly get as this game will take alot of your time e g the grinding in this game im not saying its a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added which i think a few have encountered i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game my final opinion i recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isnt a bad thing what i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as itll help the game progression for players which dont have the sort of time like others thank you for reading my review
this game used to be fantastic but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment to put this perspective for any new or current players gaijin have become even greeder than wargaming creaters world of tanks and that is saying alot as they have a certain reuptation every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however most if not all are overpriced premiums lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pittiful amount of exp gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles and sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as alot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehashs of old planes or tanks already in the game honestly give this game a miss all my 15k hours were played back during the golden age of the game before the â â â â â â â â br system and questionable design choices
early access reviewplayed a couple quick tournaments against bots so far i really like what ive seen took me less than a half hour to feel like i really had a command of the movement controls will take a little longer to get used to the characters signature weapons but its fun to learn each one some cool design decisions lots of recovery options so you can almost always get where you want to go on the stage but if you get hit you get hit pretty hard each character has two weapons available so you can switch your moveset midmatch item spawns willing to try to improve your matchup matches tend to be pretty fast and fun its free give it a try if you like it play more and possibly give em moneys
early access revieweternal is a very interesting card game that really feels like the best of both worlds magic and hearthstone the animations are good and the system is interesting however the card game is ridiculously oppresive for new players all the default ways to get cards give you the same basic common and a splash of rare cards even the basic beginner decks cost tens of thousands of dust to craft if you want to sit there and grind out horrible ridiculous games against ranked opponents or bore your mind our grinding the ai gauntlet and forge then this is your game otherwise be prepared to spend a ton of money on yet another electronic card game
early access reviewi recommend this game however i do not have much experience with the game since i actually bought it at the time no one played so i waited now it is free and i assume more people will play and i am happy for themsince this game is innovative but also quite beautiful despite this i am still dissapointed that i was stupid enough to buy it
in this review i am going to list the pros and the cons of this game i know it is hard to change the minds of people who do not like the game but i will try pros of course there are eighteen different species to hunt nineteen with the incoming caribouactive development team they have status updates weekly to keep you informed and even some surprises as well this week we got camo face paintits the only up to date hunting sim out there last one was probably deer hunter 05beautiful scenery this game is powered by the same engine that just cause and just cause two runs on realism it isnt neccasarily one hundred realistic but its the most realistic hunting game ive playedcons while this game is free to play to a certain extent for free you will probably have to pay at some point but a three month membership plus a shotgun revolver camo cap caller and a few other things is fifteen dollars for three months thats a hell of a lot cheaper than elder scrolls online which has you pay sixty dollars outright and then fifteen dollars a month for three months one hundred and five usd expensive this game can get expensive but if youre a minimalist unlike me you can get a six month membership for thirtytwo dollars and that includes license for all species access to all reserves unlimited basic ammo as well as a forty four revolver twelve ga pump action shotgunyou can shoot anything with it three hundred and fifty seven revolver compound bow snakebite thats four weapons along with those you get camping supplies which is used to travel to campsites or tents 39x40mm rifle scope wind indicator 2x20mm handgun scope boone crockett cap basic pants backpack which doubles your inventory space turkey box caller basic jacket and a tent which you can use to set up a alternate spawn in point most missions at some point require you to buy a specific weapon which is kinda bogus but oh well other than that i have no complaints about this game the game is beautiful addicting and fun as hell ive been playing for three months and i will definitely get a membership extension you pay fifteen bucks for three months to hunt everything and if you get tired of it you dont have to keep paying you pay sixty bucks for call of duty you get bored of it you take it to gamestop and sell it for a couple bucks expansive worlds has to make money and this game is aimed toward a very small group of gamers this is their namesake so they have to be able to live somehow free to play is a bit iffy and if they put a disclaimer saying that not everything is free from the start people wouldnt jump in expecting it and then getting tldr its a great game fifteen bucks for three month membership plus a couple guns and other stuff thirtytwo for four weapons plus a ton of other its aimed toward a small group of gamers they have to make money somehow eso is one hundred and five bucks for three months compare

early access reviewi remember being excited about this game when the first electroplates were released but now now with them removing rp and gc means that the loot system is now extremely poor and some people who had galaxy cash lost money and had it converted to virtual currency in an online store only problem is the conversion rate seems to be unfair in how much it gives also with how limited the cpu seems to be im usually unable to actually build what i want to build this is one of the reasons i enjoyed having a megabot so much so basically the game was good but now the devs seem more concerned about getting people to buy premium than making the game enjoyable i do think its worth trying but only if you can handle having it take ages to build anything you want and if you dont like being taunted by the visible premium only items at the end of every game
do not believe all the negative reviews this is a great hunting gameq is it totally free to play a yes no this game has enough to play for free if a you are just a casual hunter playing now and again b you dont mind only hunting five types of anaimals whitetail deer cottontail european rabbits snowshoe hare pheasant c you play to earn gm in game money by doing missions then spend that on other game licenses q do i have to spend a lot of real money to play a no not at all if you want to hunt all the animals you can get a subscription that only cost three hundred and thirty three a month less if you get a longer sub if you want to own a lot of weapons clothing hunting dog etc to customise your character youll have to spend some real money to get em the in game money that you buy with real money but how much is up to you if you buy one of the dlc those are the subscriptions three six twelve month with bonus items they cost slightly more then normal subscriptions but you only by those once for the bonus items then resub at normal rate the bonus items are worth the extra as it will save you money over buying them separately as a free player you can hunt the five animals i mentioned above you can track and spot any animal in the game you start with two free weapons two hundred and forty three bolt action rifle and the single shot shotgun you can hunt on anywhere on the map some areas will have nothing to shoot for free players you can hunt with you friends in multiplayer no you can not shoot your friends no matter how much you would like toq can you walk for long periods of time and not spot anything a yes just like in real life you can hunt for long periods without spotting anything youll find lots of tracks to follow also you will want to walk not run this isnt cod take your time walk crouched listen for movement around you just like you would have to do if you where really hunting if you like hunting games give it a try its got a great community nice graphics good hunting and its somewhat free
use to be a great gamenot any more people tank shots too muchsheid spam too muchgame crashes alot they should change the name of the game to newz frustration stories dont take any notice of my playtimei have a ton of hours in this game before it went to steamyou can still play via game launcher and thats why it looks like i dont have much in game time
"id rather play war thunder thanks at least you can fly the damn planes to be fair i havent played it at all hardly but the first impression counts and i wasnt impressed get war thunder instead and enjoy the game if you brought all the dlcs it would set you back one thousand, two hundred and fifty odd really naffoverpriced dlcbetter games out thereavoid like the plaque after reviewing devs response which is fair comment i suppose i know its not war thunder i get that i suppose it was a lame comparrison but i like fluid gameplay and to be honest i struggled a lot but as they said its a study sim which is very indepth both graphically and useability i am not a defeatist but i have given up on some games out there because well they are too involved i just want to launch a game and play and enjoy it after all its just a game its not going to get me a pilots licence etc the graphics were good but load times were slow and 19gb is a large file so i guess i was dissapointed after waiting so long for it to downloadload in the old days i used to play ef2000 which nowadays would look crap so technology and engines have come a long way but the fliudidity was there if i could have done i would have given this game a mixed recommendation and not a negative one but felt it did not desreve a yes vote still i cant get over the dlc costs sorry but i know things cost money but come on i can buy a lot of other games for that cost so that turned it for me too sorry but thats just me im sure other people with more time and money on their hands would like it"
early access reviewthis game used to be amazing it was perfect i stopped playing it for a while and recently came back to it and i have to say they completely freaking ruined it i swear they took every single good part out of the game and now it is completely pay to win great job idiots you ruined a perfectly normal game
early access reviewif you like tcg this is a great game if you like games with real action then you will probably give up on this after the first two hours of playng like i did still a good game tough
this is a â â â â ing awsome game its a little cute and bouncy looking with its simplistic 2d graphics but it can get slightly dark at times but not to dark a nuff to rate it teen or matureyet it dosnt feel watered down it really it a fallout game not a cheap cash grab and it is addictive as hellit has some pay to win stuff in it but not in a bad way so i do recomend it causeuhhhhh its free so why not give it a try
early access reviewnice concept but what i often miss at those giant spaceship game is to have a feeling for that scale and the meaning of it a fast gameplay where a single person controlls a whole ship with quick kills kind of disapoints me id like to see something similar where single players control smaller ship classes and the big ships are like team guild bases where player can dock and can take different positions on board of the main ship
early access reviewall the game wants is money they dont care about anything else now its ing hard to get money and you have to spend money to have fun this game used to be good with the back when the devs colud give a dont get this game
possibly the best idle clicker ive ever played cookie clicker meets warcraft ii so many factions so much to unlock seamless transition between mobile and pc via kongregate account i have many hours on mobile before i tried the pc version you can spend money to get some sort of in game currancy but i still havent figured out why you would want to do that
rotmg is a free bullet hellstyle mmorpg unlike many mmorpgs the pacing is fine nice and fast it also features permadeath with roguelite elements unlocking new classes and other such things each time you die i personally dont mind the art style though i know pixel art is not for everyone all in all i find the gameplay loop thoroughly enjoyable and i would recommend playing this with friends which is easy because its free for a deep fun experience
if you got a friend go for it should only take up a few hours if youre bored if you want to try more classes make separate accounts although crafting new classes isnt hard you just need to get a special item from a certain uncommon loot boxresources you pick up are shared with everyone else nearby so theres no fighting over loot the progression kind of hits a massive bump in the road at about level one thousand and twelve found myself searching endlessly and never receiving much needed upgrades to progress to the next zone leveling up had to do it and once upon reaching the new zone worse loot than previous was dropping completely halting my progression the progression is what kept me into it for the few hours but its just dead now why is lv12 zone dropping level eight loot where lv7 worlds dropped lv10 loot at the start enemies die pretty quickly as usual and youre pretty much invincible a little ways in you might have some risk of death but otherwise enemies just takea bit longer to kill then youll be at the point where every enemy is just a pure damagesponge that kills you in thirteen hits and its just rediculous quite a bit of the game is locked behind premium currency of which is quite expensive and some of it behind a massive grind that would make warframe jealous spending money gets you massive boosts that people yell p2w over the game does a poor job of explaining things you get these tutorial quests that are pretty easy to do then it wants you to craft things using materials it never tought you to harvest so i had to check the wiki on how to progress most of it was go here do this complete dungeons on the map then move to next map and thats actually all the game is doing random worthless dungeons for the slimmest chance that something decent might pop out the server lag is among some of the worst ive seen say you jump and glide but then you teleport to the ground because the server didnt register your inputs theres countless rubberbanding here and there which massively interferes with combat causing hits to not register even stuff you can collect sometimes doesnt work youll miss maybe one overall because while it looks like you collected it you didnt its invisible and once you leave and reload the area you can now see all the plants and stuff you missed that apparently didnt register you and the server often see two completely different things before they try to sync up in the most horrible way possible theres also a challenge you can take part of at the top of every hour but its so poorly programmed that if you get in there just before the timer runs out youre just wasting your time you cant get the reward even if you ace the challenge despite being eligible to enter at the time you are no longer eligible for the rewards because you cannot reenter the challenge itd be like giving a twentyfive minute race on a twenty minute timer they may complete the race but you wont give them the rewards essentially the more i play the more i see horribly wrong with it with nothing good to say
this is teh best mmorpg ever made and nowthnaks to greenlightits aviable on steamthis game has easy handling a good story and never gets boringa must ahve for every sidescroller anime beat em up lover
you really need to prepare yourself to play this game you need to be ready for people to belittle you for making small mistakes and expect everyone to have littleno regard for a good team composition expect everyone else to actively seek to assist the enemy team in any way possible that way when you encounter decent people you are pleasantly surprised people get tilted super fast and it can be terrible when idiots come in packs now that it is summer break it is going to be harder to play and stay positive with the younger crowd having the witchhunt mob mentality with reporting people so if you want to enjoy your time playing pay little attention to chat unless someone is actually attempting to offer constructive criticism dont take it personally when people talk trash unless its constructive please remember if you arent part of the solution to toxicity then you are part of the problem
started game spawned near nothing found airplane kicked zombies by punches in face found a bat and a gun with ten bullets suddenly its night and imma attacked by three or four zombies in the middle of other zombies with no more bullets in my gun pressing three to take my bat and smash some zombie heads but nothing my guy is really scared i guess not willing to change the weapon and stick with the gun with no bullets dead for ten mins character actually cant get in the game for ten mins u must create another survivor but ill use that time for disinstall
updated june thirty two thousand and seventeen if you are or were a fan of blizzards hearthstone but despise blizzard then this is your light at the end of the tunnel a masterpiece card game that raises the bar for the genre to yet unsurpassed levels of excellence truly an ultimate achievement from the guys who brought us the elder scrolls all of the lore is in this game the racial elements and all of the awesomesauce from the rpgs making it a great experience to play addicting as hell so beware once you start playing dont expect to be able to walk away if you have a background in mtg or hearthstone then this will be simple for you to get going and to be able to compete in a short amount of time heroes of skyrim has been introduced and it is pretty impressive the only bad thing is that this didnt increase the playerbase of the game it still hovers between 3k5k or lower depending on offpeak times the reasons for this problem are up to the developer to fix hopefully they will find a way to resolve things and get this game to a pinnacle of glory where it so deserves to be
early access reviewthis game is just amazing the smooth quality and gameplay of it is just amazing especially if it is in alpha however when matchmaking is finally fixed the networking for the game went completely downhill but overall amazing game kinda reminds me of world of tanks though
i have almost three hundred hrs into this game its not something you want to take seriously if you do then you will become very frustrated and spend multiple hundreds of dollars on i know because ive spent over five hundred on upgrades across multiple countries with russia not being our closest allie i stayed away from them i was born and raised in the usa so i went for my country and their allies i didnt realize or know that this game is for the russians if you choose a faction make it the russians they are by far and wide more powerful than anything the kill the most powerful tanks of any other country with one shot even if its multiple levels lower dont waste your money or time im finding all the free to play games are jacked up i will stay away from them there will be a shift away from them and they will learn and go bankrupt hahahaha
welcome to duel links nothing has changed from the mobile version including packs that only contain three cards which at their exchange rate makes this more expensive than playing the real gameno trading in a trading card gameungodly grinding designed specifically to make you spend tons of moneyoverly long cutscenes that waste your timenetdecking your way to victory
i wish i could recommend this but this game is just straight up you need cash to git gud type of game you can give it a shot but eventaully you will feel very underpower and force to cash to just catch up pvp is cancer wouldnt enter it if you want to lose
i think this is a good game recently they changed the main map to make it smaller and more fast paced i cant compare it to how it was before because i began to play this game after the change but looking at the changelogs at least it looks like the devs are listening to the community the good i really like how the combat feels in this gameevery ship feels different and has a different playstyleits f2p but not pay to win skill still is what matters in the end of the day its not the worst f2p system ive seen but its still f2p you can take a lot of time to unlock ships and crew or buy it with real cash i dont think the prices are abusive though the latest released ship costs about eight and the old ones you can get for around one but i would still prefer to pay a one time price and get everything frequent updatesthe bad matchmaking is not perfect you get a lot of people with very different skills but at least it does try to even the teams a bitthe recent change in the map made people mad i kinda wish to know how it was before the change maybe the devs will change it to be a bit more like it used too there are only two mapsarenasgame modes available coming from a moba like heroes of the storm i feel the lack of more maps with different objectivesstrategies to spice up the game overall i would recommend this game
great game allows various types of builds for the same class the passive skill tree allows each char to be what the user wants it to be the new dlc betrayal is sick it makes every map interesting lookibg for things to kill and for items to get it gets kinda grind and grind but it s worth it for endgame and the best of all it s free
when i first purchased this game i was thinking this was going to be some kind ofmemory game and well it is but its so much more first off this is a memory game but not just any memory game its a game about disassembling reassembling and even remembering how each gun is taken apart and put back together with without using the guides this game is really about remembering the order in which you have to assemble the parts theres also a shooting range for each gun so you get an idea on how to use the gun as well as teaches you how to spare your ammo for each target and on how you can learn to use each gun on aiming handle and even practice on moving targets one thing to note about this game is that although it is called world of guns its not just about guns theres also sections of the game that lets you disassemble and reassemble skeletons army vehicles tank humvee sports cars and even a harley during the course of playing the game you also get some really neat info about each weapon vehicle and skeleton details about the make model history concept and what went into making each weapon what i like most about this game is how well detailed the designer put into making each part of every weapon someone did some serious homework on this game based on how many parts each gun has i found this game not only fun but also informative and even help me to learn to respect weapons learning how the mechanics and insides work was the best part about his game i have read some other reviews and they seem to claim that some parts of the game were too hard although i can somewhat understand this is more of a memory game as each gun vehicle skeleton as an order in which its assembled so you have to remember the order of the parts in order to get a good score this is a memory game not so much a shooter game some guns have as much as one hundred parts to remember while a few guns only have say two thousand and thirty parts every part has its place every part must also be done in a certain order so you got to use your head more than use your speed once you know how the parts go speed will follow this is is a trial and error game as well as memory game if you like memory games this is a good game to get warning although this game is free you can purchase download content which opens up all the areas of the game or you can purchase experience points as well as credits to open up only a few select areas you only start out with one gun at the beginning and must earn experience and credits to open up other areas of the game you earn experience and credits when you complete tasks on each gun
early access reviewthis game confuses me because it isnt badly done its a f2p game but its mostly pay2avoidgrind there are some p2w elements to it but ive not noticed them have any significant impact on the game you gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly i was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing the interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun isnt actually bad infact its pretty good youre essentially a metal box of antiinfantry that can park in any barn you want it works well and you dont feel crapped on from above just because youre not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash the weapons are heavily customisable and they actually make a difference i have an smg that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it wonderful thing since im such a crap shot you can also steal bicycles and give people backies which is clearly a major selling point the game itself is very basic theres not much to it its a ww2 shooter which feels to me like day of defeat on battlefield sized maps but its nothing special just a shooter but it has me hooked ive no idea why the game is average but the fact that its a f2p game that doesnt feel like im forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point i could use a bigger tank sure you gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks but i dont want to because everything in this game from basic gear to bigger gear has its place im still confused as to exactly what it is about this game i like maybe its just simply because its hitting all the right notes for a f2p game that wants to include a p2w element but doesnt feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it maybe its because the game is barebones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way or maybe its just because i can steal some americans bicycle for the glorious fatherland
early access reviewi know the game is pre alpha i understand that balancing and lack of options in the game settings will be fixed but at the moment its more unplayable than totally accurate battlegrounds was on release date and at those days the game was crashing every five minutes but this game ubers all you get stuck constantly in invisible walls the zone is changing and coming faster than ever and since you cant determine your own spawn location you most likely spend about 810th if the game running throught fields naked the weapon balance is so ed up you get oneshot by an smg but a buttnaked enemy needs atleast two hits from a boltaction sniper rifle to die not to mention that the spawnrate of weapons is ridiculously low there were times when you loot a whole village previously unvisited by any other player and you are still lucky to find a pistol with a magazine or two and the drop rate of any kind of loot is unchanged even in squads so you have a good chance at finishing the game with two of your group members still not having a weapon the developers really have to get themselves together to do anything because atm its comedic effects and originality are far overshadowed by tabg
if you are looking for a good sandbox game dont play this the developers decided it would be a good idea to do loot crates like crossout just a few weeks after crossout came out along with the new update it is now a pay to win one beacaus you get double the items if you pay a stupid amount money you also cant paint your bot without paying because the colors you gat are light blue gray orange or white if you dont believe me play one round and when you say this game is dont say i didnt warn you edit now they have just implemented a battle royale mode and dlcs over one hundred so if you want to have fun play literaly any other game the game used ot be good and its just bad now youll find alot of long time players quit playing becasue it was a free to play game now it a paytoplay
dont waste your timethis is one of those f2p games where if you wany anything other than the basics youre going to have to shell out some actual moneytheres an ingame currency system but its pointless because all you can spend it on is ammo and pemits if you want anything other than a rifle and scope youll have to pay real money
early access reviewat first i was excited for this game character creator is amazing combat seemed fun and dynamic enough in the training area but thats where the good ends unoptimized microtransaction heavy cash shop money for dungeon teleportation really infinite bugs that devs seem keen to ignore unreleased content that is released in other regions dont buy this game i hope i can still refund it maybe ill come back later when they decide that their playerbase matters more but this game for now lol
early access reviewgreat game for nowit needs a lot of care to become a good one compered to the other games same type and btw guyss the crosshair is for realsi non keep it up great work cool game
early access reviewexcellent space combat game its what i would imagine space warfare would look like in the next two hundred years if we dont kill ourselves worth the price just in alpha
if you want the experience play on a valve pub at first not other ones as they may have mods like x10 besides that though dont go complaining about engineer relying too much on his buildings its what he was meant to do oh and dont complain about other classes then yours being op half the time since they are more likely a higher skilled player than you thats just my opinion
early access reviewits is a realy good game but you should remove the grenades andor nerf them because u can manage to get three per player a game and up to fifteen a team and every grenade deals to many damage they can all one tap you
early access reviewthis game is rly cool and entertaining for plebs like me who cant afford to buy pubg its still in early access needs a little bit of fix in some details but overall its an awesome game to play w friends
its a very nice basketball game that confuses me with its controls and annoys me with its voice acting ive only played a few games with one of my friends and both of us after that were saying nothing but come on oinker pass the ball seriously it drove me insane after that i never touched the game ever again not because im not into basketball but because the menu is difficult to navigate and all the little extras that they have is confusing and something i just dont see myself wasting my time on this is one of those times where i wish steam would add a meh in between or average button instead of just a recommend or dont recommend
i really wish i could have actually played this game even with its paytoplay aspects my biggest problem is that i have made three acounts over the past few weeks and i still have yet ot get in the servers the only reason i have a few hours recorded is beacuse i spent a lot of time with the login window up while it tried to trouble shoot this is just a heads up to all those who are hesitant but at this point this game isnt even worth the time
turns out plus is a pretty big negative why not just bring back battle cup at 1week and leave it at that adding extra features to entice people to play more dota2 dota was always better then other mobas because everything was unlocked at the start and there was no p2w gg volvo gg
you know after having spet three thousand hours since march of last year and spending so much time in the game i saw the appeal that many players do it was truly a great game in more ways than i can count i know its legacy will live strong nine hundred and eleven poor exicution
early access reviewive put a lot of time into this game and given them a fair share of money but this company is headed down the wrong path i could write a long and lenghty review where i go over every step of the games development but you know what heres a synopsis this game is fun at its current state though you will have to grind for hundreds of hours to get where you want to be or you can spend fifty dollars the choice is yours
early access reviewi guess after they failed the game twice it was about time to milk the west i wish that the coreean devs realise that we are not going to eat this anymore and we are not the rich relatives across the ocean who put one hundred bucks in your pockets while you cant even wash your sockets the game is terrible at many aspects it has an outdated engine stupid combat system totally unatractive story and lore instances and the claustrofobic feeling that you are walking on a small map even if the world is huge is just on paper is actually composed of many small places tied together buy it at your own risk but i am writing this as a statement for you all stop supporting the asian developers is time they learn to threat the western market with respect and deliver good and finished products at the prices that they would normally practice in their countries respect the buyer or sell yoyr to the russians
early access reviewit pains me dearly to thumb down this once great game i hadnt played it in well over a year since the guys i used to play it with havent been on much this was one of my favorite free to play games back in the day but after giving it a quick play earlier today i had a rude awakening they completely on the mechanics that had originally made the game popular it went from an ingenious invention based fast paced combat game to a piece of pay to win flat game that belongs to that grayed out group of games youve uninstalled i could explain all the issues that lead this game to its sad current state or i could just link you this https robocraftgame that explains it perfectly
early access reviewfor a beta i think its very good some things like the goldexp drop could be improved and usable items could be dropped instead of just crafting materials my main complaint is that the summon friend function doesnt work you either face an endless connecting to server screen or appear in the world with a semiopaque joining friends server box in the middle of your screen unable to attack but vulnerable to enemies and your friend is nowhere to be seen
early access reviewspace based moba beautiful graphics so far and its tons of fun to play its still early access so theres issues and bugs but the devs are always on top of it constantly paying close attention to their forums and investigating the issue as soon as they can
if youre into shooter games and you want to know how some of the guns you use there work this is the perfect game for you also if you like puzzle games i recommend playing this because this game is basically puzzling just with weapon parts the different game modes and achievements make it challenging for example disassembling and reassembling a gun in a certain amount of time or not making mistakes in choosing the right part at the right time
i got this on steam when it was still a baby it has now grown into a giant you can tweak this game to your heartâ s desire what a brilliant simulator it has become i always favored rfactor2 but i must say raceroom has now taken the lead this really is the best racing sim you can buy project cars feels like a console game and ac like a boat simulator keep up the good work sector three
the game is a good game if you like running aroud for a litlle looking for things and getting killed alot by zombiesthings bad1 server dissconnections are often2 zombies will spawn out of the blue sometimes3 really easy to find armour and guns4 low food in areas5 boring after ten to fifteen minslast finding people is really hard unless you get in a game with at least one hundred or fifty peoplethats my opinion about the game overall but their were good things about needs some improvment in the updates of the game tha5ts my opinion about this video game
i play the game and have really really big fun to bad the game kick me because i use hack for real i was playing normali and boom all of my time on the game is now gone i ask why my acc is permabaned and they didnt tell me so i make a new steam acc so i can start again playing it and after some time i got permabaned again so dont play it because at one point you will lose all cool weapons and your time
has got to be one of the games with the worst matchmaking ive seen in a while you tell me every twentyfive games that i have a great behaviour score and almost every match you match me up with people who tilt abandon the game flame everybody what the is going on this is a game nobody should play all it does it anger people
early access reviewthe most hilarious inebriated fun i have had in a long time grab some friends fire up teamspeak or sit next to them drink alcohol and have an amazing time
early access reviewhow can you allow a game to be downloaded from this site that installs software that cannot be removed using the uninstallremove programs tool roachesto remove https www youtube comwatch vp3qkfq8ymk8https www youtube comwatch vqipooomojre
the devs clearly dont give a damn about this game theyve made nothing but improvements to the skin while constant bugs reduce the quality of the game this game is just a skin simulator its a shame because it has so much potential
early access reviewkill someone nooobget killed by someone ahahahahahahah ownedkill someone with grenade you fu luck get killed by someone from a grenade lololollol you are a noob get killed by a teammade get out of the way you fu idot accidentaly kills a teammate watch it you fu idiotdrives a car wait for me you noobheadshot someone you fu hackerget heashoted by someone ahahahahahahah owned you noobyour team win all the enemy team ragequitsyour enemy team win all your teammates ragequitsinternet prob game crashes for one dayotherwise i like this game one thousand and ten rage simulator twenty fourteens
lets start with the basics okay so the game is similar to the very popular game called league of legends well but since i dont really like i mean i hate league of legends i didnt really plan to play with this game either because i heard that its very similar to that game and you know since i dont like that game why would i like this one after i played it it turned out that its much better i repeat much better than league of legends because in league of legends you get to play as like a strategy game camera position from above clicking to move etc and i dont really like strategy games either but there are some that i liked a bit for example red alert but thats different also this game is played in third person mode you can play with a lot of good characters but here they are called gods because actually some of them that i know are really gods that has been confirmed by people in the old ages who knows when and so yes the game is really similar to league of legends but as i said its much betterthe game has got a quite good graphics it has a good fighting system it has a fair money system because here there is no pay to win there is only pay to skin maybe that you can get because skins are the things for the gods that you can get by paying for the game or by collecting gems or at some skins favors that is used for the money itself in the game anywayor there could be pay to win if someone pays a lot for the game just to get all the gods its even possible to do it on low level by paying for the game there are different type of classes like in any mmorp games you know like those common classes like warrior assassin mage etc whatever anyone says if you get to learn to use a specific class or a character then you can play well with that but it depends on you for example i cant really play with the class mage but theres a mage character like as i said a specific character sometimes that i can use wellso i think if you would like to get to know or to try this game i really recommend you this one anyway this game is really based on teamwork so the team has really gotta work together well to succeed otherwise if you solo if you like go alone and try to do everything on your own you will failunfortunately sometimes there are hackers but you can report themp s you can play with bots as well theres a tutorial in the game you can practice etc
pros one an interesting and varied world of heroes2 view from a third party3 a variety of combat modes minuses one most of the characters have to buy only one minus and then decide if you have the opportunity to spend a little and buy a ready pack with all the gods the rest some pluses
great game ruined by the worst developers i have ever seen hirez have a great game idea the third person moba is great but lowrez keep putting out updates that no one wants the new ui is the latest dumb idea they basicaly copy and pasted the console ui and stuck it on pc with zero optimisation it is ugly and confusing to use it also has much less features then the original ui which everyone liked their skin releases r just stingy almost all their skins r only unlockable from chests with one in fifty chanceof getting what u want hirez dont listen to their player base at all if they did this could be an amazing game as the gameplay and mechanics r all there this game is like vomit that tastes nice looks and is unappetising but is good if u can overlook the many flaws
early access reviewits not bad it feels like a very basic shooter in the vein of modern warfare no real paytowin elements however hit detection seems a bit off at least when i played and ttk is just frankly too high if you want this game download ironsight instead miles better
early access reviewhonestly the last pdate completely ruined the game right before it it was a pretty good game im obv not a hardcore vet of this game but i liked to play it ccasually but it seems like now i get into lobbies where the creations almost seem godlike while mine still have the original cannons it may just be me but i cant stand this game anymore
a quality free to play action rpg it has a skill system similar to final fantasy viis materia system where you put a skill gem in a piece of equipment to gain access to new abilities or passive bonuses that can link to other skill gems in the same piece of equipment that has linked slots as well as getting one passive skill point per level up to spend in a skilltree reminiscent of final fantasy xs system minus killing enemies for ap you get to play through a well made campaign with several acts without paying a dime if youre a fan of games like diablo ii torchlight etc you should definitely give this game a try sometime
takes the arpg genre pioneered by blizzard with their diablo series and improves on it if you loved diablo ii and were disappointed by the relative simplicity of diablo iii path of exile offers endless opportunity to theorycraft diverse characters
early access reviewim going to give a complete barebones review pros space shooterlooks greattechtreegreat mechanicsnot p2wcons cannot talk in gamemost of the community does not work as a teamnew grindingsome ships are a little p2wwait times for a match three minutes thats insaneall in all seven hundred and ten really hope they improve on some things but good game
early access reviewas of currently i can not say i like what i see even for a beta this game is quite broken though gameplay is the only one that isnt broken to my knowledge but its the loading the buffering the waiting its too long i mean i expected this to be basically planetside but in a wwii era instead i get a battlefield free to play though im not arguing on that subject i actually dont mind in the slightest but the fact that i had to wait nearly fifteen minutes just to get to the main menu and an additional five minutes to get into a game i rather just update planetside two and play that and after the game was done i got to the point where i could unlock buy weapons and that broken too everytime i buy a weapon it doesnt respond i keep clicking and i never unlock the weapon again i can reason it being a beta i should expect some issues but this has been out since july and its nearing the end of august i think there should of been plenty of time for this to not be an issue for future players like me i want to enjoy this game but with the waiting and the nonresponse of the menu i cant exactly say im impressed nor makes me want to come back whats the point in waiting nearly half an hour to play one game when there are other games like it that are not only polished but finished to where it can take me just mere seconds to play a game maybe when its officially released i may come back to see if its been improved but after tonight im more likely not coming back
product received for freeearly access reviewdevs are living in thier own little world and refuse to listen to the community last update was the worst thing ever for any person who has played the game before it they removed all progression systems most strategic robot building and guaranteed currency in all freejam is ruining thier game
pay to win simple as that if you like spending loads of cash into games then this game will be loads of fun otherwise you will have a really hard time in pvp its extremely unbalanced also not just from damage from p2w players but with characters cheesing their way doing one combo kills and unable to mana break or extremely op skills one shotting players will argument its not p2w because you can get stuff without purchasing you can doesnt change the fact that it will be near impossible for a new player without spending cash to keep up with veteran p2w players just watch videos from jae hae gwon in youtube excellent player and watch his video of why he stopped playing elsword
as a huge fan of the elder scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me its really personal preference whether you play this magic or hearthsone etc but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double laning system in esl the story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and theyre many different ways to test out new decks created vs ai or actual players there is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too and also there is a nice addition of solo arena which pits you versing tough ai characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose three times each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards the deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation overall this would be my favorite card game in its current genre eight hundred and ten
early access reviewthis game is like magic the gathering if you could just get all the cards by grinding therefore its 100000000x one hundred billion times better than magic this is the way to waste every single one of your waking hours and if you need to quit your job in order to play more you wont even fall behind in the meta for the inability to buy more cards you just keep grinding good game but i wish ranked mode gave better payouts than the ai mode
early access reviewhalf lego half team deathmatch drivingflying combat well executed good use of the freemium model pay for faster access to new toys but its not pay to wini got a lot of enjoyment out of just building lots of different weird robots it can get a bit grindy once you hit the higher levels but i figure thats just trying to incentivise people to pay
early access reviewgame has been somewhat fun but the mana flood problems make you feel like one out of every five games is just down to pure luck and some games are just nonplayable due to a huge rng due to deck size is too large seventyfive cards the mandatory twentyfive power cards wild card swingsthe mulligans are stupid crazy your first hand can be one power automatic mulligan into two power cards followed by the next five cards of no power cards thus automatic lossmaybe if they fixed the power cards mulligan it would feel like more strategy but a lot of my wins losses are just feeling like one person got mana screwed while the other did not so rare to have a good close game its just silly to think its strategy at this point
early access reviewi glanced through the negative comments about this game and boy that was entertaining the read whinings of people who didnt understand a thing about this game i wont spend my time explaning why this is a good card game if you like mtg mechanics and want to see them implemented in a hs like ui this is the game for you if you are used to hearthstones super simplistic resource method this game is not for you if you are an old dog like me who still enjoy card games with seperated resource cards included in the deck which by the way there are tons of ways to use the amount of extra mana you have for your advantage this is your game
after all these years do you guys really think you can keep getting away with treating your players like sheep coming from someone with unfortunately hundreds of dollars into this game having played since twenty thirteens and being a tankairplane nut you cannot present your game as one which requires players to pay money to grind the rank fifty six grind is so unbearable at times that people will just quit the game instead of sticking around why do they quit because its ridiculous trying to grind a stock vehicle and putting up with the repair costs after you get walked over because its stock thats not a fun grinding challenge thats being slapped in the face gaijin fix yourâ â â â â
alright kids listen up cause heres a life lesson this game is dangerous youll start out fine but then your life will perpetuate into a spiral of doom you will be called some of the most horrid things ever typed by a human being in every language there is and all for picking some purple horned bastard you will rage inumerable times and get sent to valves version of hell low priority here everything is worse more russians worse players more profanity and its all your fault for some reason youll quit play again quit again play again buy one thousand of cosmetic items cry laugh its almost as if this is valves version of a shakspeareian play from the pits of hell that gabe dragged up personaly for us its shown as free to play but its not by any means this game will steal your soul and laugh at you while it does so and the best part is youll love every minuet of your life hat you burn on this game get it now befor it gets you
if you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay dont bother with war thunder every now and then theyll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for golden eagles and the player base doesnt wantyou see that in the forums rather than to fix year old bugs the russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly this most experianced in the mode realistic battle where its nation vs nation and the russian nation has a win rate over eighty at ranks two and three over ninety the rng for russian tanks ai just a joke becouse theyll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with one shot becouse off op ammo some ww2 tanks have post war ammoyou really dont have anything else to play than random battles if youre not in a clan and the mm is one of the worst ive ever seen it doesnt even ballance the team by vehicle types so you get into matches planes where twelve of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters thats an auto loosegrinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them dont get me wrong the game was good at patch one hundred and thirty five more than a year ago maybe two but after that it just got worse a lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates one hundred and thirty seven and one hundred and forty three where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message
its like angry birds but without the birds and you have cards instead that you can pay forits like doodle jump except there is no ledges to jump on so you just end up killing yourself every time you playaddicting though would my friend in a duel again
"i am no stranger to mmos having played world of warcraft since vanilla as well as playing wildstar and star citizen but when i did finally try neverwinter i was blown away the small guys have come out with one huge great game and i am a daily player now and absolutely love it they did a heck of a job on it considering a lot of the competition out there has a lot more money and power to put into their games but this is every bit as good and i will play it for a long time to come if you are thinking of trying it then do so you will not be disappointed one bit and will be hooked instantly as i was an easy nine thousand, five hundred and ten"
beefspookys house of jumpscares is probably one of my favorite horror games theres a ton of references to other horrorgamesim someone whos easily spooked and my friends have most certainly enjoyed hearing my screams in panic when the cutest little squid pops up in my screen i have also enjoyed the screams of a bunch of my friends in the same way i recommend anyone to make a friend play this while at their house or screensharing during a call some of the enemies are actually more challenging than i had thought and it took quite a while till i beat the final boss i must say im not really a pro gamer thoughand its completely free
ive only played this game for x amount of time on steam but ive been playing it for quite some time now through glyph every single second ive spend in this game has been awesome wether it was some simple fishing or killing dangerous monsters everything has and still is amazing if youre new to the game however feel free to use my referral code 2tt6cyqpznnhrnpnnfwd

gotta say they ruined this game with their bias towards the ussr planes arent balanced that terribly but ground forces is just pathetic you have ww2 german vehicles trying and i mean trying to fight postwar vehicles let alone prototypes that never saw combat and were basically put there to balance out the fact that the 88cm was a monster of a gun ive put 88s into a t95s side weak points t29s front hull which it should pentrate least if they were using the correct values and not the sixty deg aot ones and various other instances of ttery dont get me wrong tanks are a blast just dont commit to germany because they constantly get nerfed and higher tiers is all but impossible dont even buy the maus as youll just face atgm and apfsds rounds that make anything but spaced armour useless all in all this russian dev company has an obvious hatred for the tanks that ruined their forces for a while
early access review ing dissapointed after defending the game for so long they finally release it with the same optimisationthey said it would be better translation from google translatemaybe even worse and with all endgame content missingthis was advertised in their steam page stay away from eastern mmorpgs
early access reviewi love this game i enjoy the controller support be and my cousin played it till two in the morning one day night the next day there is too much stuff you have to buy i think you should be able to unlock some themed weapon skins or something great game thought
played seven hours today and all is fine and so on but in the story you suddenly reach a point where the enemy has much better cards than you doesnt seem fair or legit because i dont think it has much to do withthe taktics i just get the feels that im forced to buy some cards decks wit real money and thats not really ceap seems like a pay to win strategie solong for this game it was nice till that point never the less and its free
one hundred and three brought me back and reminded me of all the reasons i left in the first place i dont like the ground combat hell the only that kept me going was the promiss of air combat and i didnt even get that far the cost for some of these units is just too much being able to rate your battles is a nice feature btw not worth my time
the sakura games are pretty nice vns but this one is just a clicker copy and a bad one i had to actually play it for five minutes to review it i just want to warn people its a waste time and it kinda sucks many weebs will rate any anime game with a one thousand and ten back then on steam an anime game was a rarity so any anime game was like a gem to be able to play it on steam and get backgrounds for it there wasnt much out therebut i think we reached that point where theres enough already in short the game is very boringi played it for two minutes and couldnt review itso i left it idle for another three minutes just to give it a bad score
if you like the feeling of clicking and not fapping to censored hentai then this is a game for you cutting edge graphics derivative story progression and next gen mechanics sakura clicker is ign one thousand and ten not real hentai do not get me started on the all star voice acting
early access reviewthis game is well worthy of your support not only are the developers offering a fantastic deal and price cut on four packs to entice a healthy game population for testing but the game is actually playable enough to be a really good hour block of enjoyment at a time this game is perfect for those times when you need to kill an hour and dont wanna get into anything go buy this game its cheap its fun
whenever i decide to go back to path of exile i remember the good old days when i didnt have any income whatsoever but was just so excited by the thought of playing those few games i could path of exile was one of those games if my memory serves me correctly i have upwards of two hundred hours logged in this arpg each update added a new layer to the complexity of the game for a new player the complexity was something that initially pushed me away just take a moment to look up path of exile passive tree and you will get a good idea of what i mean it is or was easy to make a character that had such poorly allocated stats that it was very difficult to progress perhaps that is or was a part of its charm you have to figure out what skill gems equipment support gems passive tree configurations and if you were so lucky as to get a relevant one unique items would serve you best finally claiming success in beating all of the acts for the first time brought me a feeling that i would claim rivals beating a dark souls game for the first time i have not caught up with the community but in my experience it can be quite toxic i recommend trying it out with personal friends or alone rather than a random party that being said it is absolutely viable to play on ones own and that is was i did before i figured out how to properly navigate the initially confusing ui definitely need an open mind when trying this one out
started playing this game without realizing that its a cellphonefacebook game it is very slowpaced with it taking hours for your dwellers to accomplish certain things the pace wouldnt be a problem by itself but once you get past a certain level enemies get exponentially more difficult making it impossible to continue to advance without microtransactions andor some actual strategy considering that this games pace at best relegates it to the category the idea of spending more than a couple dollars or putting more than couple hours of effort into it is absurd
early access reviewi want to recommend this game i really do but if a game been in development and failed in two separate markets dies were just the last cash grab out the door for this game such and obvious cash grab and we all fell for it though the fighting style feels so rewarding if you are in a place that isnt shaking like a geriatric bad fps
product received for freefirst of all where is the sound the sound is not automatically enabled this game seriouslyin all the games ive ever played never has the game thrown me into the game without sound could you atleast tell us that we have to enable sound second the game crashes and alttabs at random which really messed up my chance of unlocking other gamemodes which brings me to my third point really i have to do something just to unlock the fun part the fun part the fun part of the entire game i am not even level two yet and this game already suckszero stars for this gamemaybe if you fixed these problems before releasing it it wouldve been an actually good game
great and oh whats this i bought club member and i played for nineteen hours and i found out that all my data was erased and my in app purchases and i have been waiting three months for help god have mercy dont buy this
early access reviewi dunno how many cheaters there are but from what i heard with pubg the games wher we are forced to play with utsiders are filled with cheaters like the ones i did see jumping thirty feet in the air from the comment responses i see i assume the devs are attacking negtive reviews and i assume since they can do this the super jumper had on bunny shoes that must have been a dev wearing a dev created item and not a lowly modder he had amazing shots for jumpign up and down thirty feet over and over if i jumped out a second story window it would damage me slightly so he must have had unlimited health yeah so region lock the game and lock the devs out the servers xd
great graphics give those a one thousand and ten even though the rendering is terrible i was about one hundred and fifty feet away from these trees i could only see until i looked through my rifle scope but the bad part pay to have fun i started with this rifle and a liscense only to hunt mule deer i could hunt rabbits but my gun wasnt right for hunting those had no idea how to do anything because i got no tutorial i dont know why to buy guns from what i could tell you absolutely had to use real money same for almost everything else the developers of this game will rip you off even though its actually free to play it dont even bother letting it take up space on your pc inless you want to shell out money if you want you can buy an overpriced membership and have a litle bit of fun for a few months
its a very fun game to play when there is nothing else would only recommend to play multiplayer with friends it would be a lot better if you could do more without having to spend money to get all the really good itemschests etc overall i would rate this game p
update in comments this is the first flight sim ive played since i built my pc so forgive me if i dont know the pricing model for games like this so i invested in a stick and throttle since i wanted to give flight simulation a chance which was definitely worth it its truly amazing when you finally accomplish your first flight and start to get the feel for the aircraft ive gotten to the point where i want to purchase a new plane that i can learn to dogfight with so with a little bit of research ive learned that the p51 and the f15 are two of my the best options for beginners along with that research i find out that the developers have increased the pricing on content that has been out for several years already i understand that it must take a lot of time and effort to make these realistic models but forty for one plane p51d eighty for the newest release that seems so highly priced as a newcomer i would also gladly buy the f15 if the price wasnt raised fifty it seems like in almost every other genre of gaming that would be taboo being a new pc gamer there are a ton of games i want to play and the last thing i want to do is join a community that is about to start getting shafted by price hikes to buy the two planes p51df15c i want it would cost me fifty five i may just not understand the cost of making the product but that just seems ridiculous to me especially since these items arent even close to new
dcs world is the best sim platform on the market today and its future looks amazing if you love sims this product is for you its great to see current versions of the products back in steam
early access reviewsimply doesnt work i refunded it poor decisions off the bat like only one server per region on launch locking one faction when it had more players than the other more downtime than up during the headstart on top of all that it really doesnt deliver what it said it would the optimisation is a joke and its also translated horribly
do not confuse this game with world of tanks this game is a knockoff to find the original game you need to go to https worldoftanks com both games play about the same they are pvp they are both pay to win the original game has much better graphics both games are basically a set of maps with tank battles of fifteen pvp fifteen unless you set up private battles are training or setting up your tank for a battle thats it tank battles and pay cash for equipment the argument that you can play without paying is a lie well only if you want to preview the game but you cant realistically compete without paying cash the grind is so ridiculously slow without dumping real world cash into it you will ether give up or buy gold
it has been and still is one of the best free to play games out which gets a lot of support and added content quite frequently if you are a diablo two fan then you will enjoy this game highly recommend you try it
early access reviewlove love love its still just getting started but theyre off to a great start ae has always made outstanding games and this one is no different new contenet is rolling out pretty smoothly and the environment is rich and beautiful
i was so excited to play this game and really want to enjoy it it has a lot going for it problem is no one is playing it at least the matchmaking cant seem to find a single person to play with friday night you would think it could find a game nope now maybe this isnt an issue for people more skilled or leveled up but sadly i cant level up because i cant find a game because matchmaking cant seem to find anyone got the armada pack wish i could get a refund since i cant do anything but play against the computer solo and its no fun great game though wish i could play it with anyone
early access reviewgreat game like world of warships but in space and without the insane grind i hope the developers will market it more aggressively like partnering up with a well known franchise and releasing ships related to that franchise e g world of warships and arpeggio
i put in hours and hours into this game but end up getting ed by one guy i bet every medallion on a game with out knowing i was going up on this ing youtuber with one thousands hours and butt ed me with the cheap round thirteen rush after hours of playing this game i never felt so ing butt ed by one person plz dont let this happen to you go away as fast as you can and play some csgo oh wait they made that game easy for hackers to well hack its f2p and prime is given to all users who paid for the game i also paid for skins and ended up no using them and going back to the basic ones as some of the skins are way to big and some times would block me seeing some bloons till it was to late ing round thirteen rush you if you rush in round thirteen and boost
was clicking so hard that i eventually started punching the mousepad of my laptop didint realise my parents came home the only sound in the house was moans and furious banging1110
early access reviewit feels like a free to play game with all the premium players running around in low tiers with just one or two legendary weapons and wiping the whole server devs go read the veteran comments i have if you care about your game you should really try to listen to them
as allways there is this horrible micro transactions well not so micro in this case i rather pay fifty for a complete game then paying over one hundred for all the content you want shame on you game developers
"honestly the game is really cool and super fun its just the online player matching needs more level seperation the rookie matching is lvls one hundred and twenty three it should be lvl one hundred and ten then lvls one thousand, one hundred and twenty then twentyone up its super lame when your a low level and you get constantly matched against people who have high level characters that make every single 3pt shot and block everything side note the intro music gets super annoying but in all its a really fun game love the customization and character selections its really just the matchmaking that is the problem"
legends are veery broken hitboxes are veeeryy brokenfull of toxic spammer for playerstbrh its a very bad game i dont recommendi think u should go and play super smash bros or street fighter or tekken or mortal kombat
might be a wargaming but on here pure hacks t2 tank running t7 weapon seen often many of the clans was perm banned of wot now play here like always steam games safe for them to hack
early access reviewthis was one of my favorite games i had decided to recently redownload it and found it had went the way of too many games the free to play coverup instead of getting expierence from battles and then being able to trasnfer it into more parts you get basic parts and if you want anything else youre just straight out of luck i dont recommend this game in its current state
dcs is clearly not an arcade air combat game it is a airland combat simulator so if you are having a hard time dont complain prosgood views are good aircraft damage is so damn coolterrain rendering is nice consonly two free planesall planes need to be bought but good thing some are at avery affordable priceif you like fighter jets like i do give this simulator a shot it is worth the downloadtime
awful it makes fun for the first ten hours or so but there will be the point where you have to decide if you want to give up your entire life to learn the frames or every move character weapon and literally everything else in the game which may take up to two hundred hours or you need to accept that everyone you face in ranked will be diamond and the out of you because the matchmaking is trash i wont even recommend starting to play this game also its important to mention that skins are overpriced af
okay so why am i not recommending this game if ive already played it for well above 1k hrs you see the game is amazing the pvp is great the map is great the mechanics are great as well the people theyve entrusted to handle with the bans dont even verify that the evidence given to them is indeed true which leads to people getting banned for doing nothing wrong im tired of hearing that my friends getting banned wrongfully so until you guys fix this issue this review stays negative my old reviewfun game to play with friendsway less hackers compared to the original iss my friends and i have only encountered one so far in 282hrs playtimepvp is really good since theyve added pvp mapsactive devscurrently there are only two server regions which are north america and europe pls add a server for south east asiaserver issues and crashes
early access reviewover 300hrs played until the epic loot expansion who ever thought it was a good idea to gain robits by recycling junk out of boxes after each match for a pathetic amount of robits to put towards the parts i need or want take everyons premium currency they had and reduce whats its worth should be fired
theres two kinds of people that write negative reviews on this game one people who either have bad internet connection or are unlucky enough to be located near the edge of the world far from servers2 players who cant accept the fact that they are being smashed by lowly spammers and they ramble on about how unfair the game is it wouldnt be if you got goodthere are a few reasons why i would recommend this game one of which is that you can find really amazing individuals walking around in all game modes ffa has a significant lack of them but they can rarely still be seen there i feel like hitboxes in this game are really fair you will sometimes get hit by something you wouldnt expect but you couldve known it has a weird hitbox and couldve played around it whenever something bad happens to you you couldve done something better every mistake is a learning ground and one that you created yourself and this is true also for real life have a nice life and hopefully a nice experience with this game
im gonna be honest i never intended to try this im not a huge fan of tes but i do love the series and its atmosphere i was convinced this was simply another heartstone ripoff aimed to steal the audience i imagined it as a cheap clone because honestly thats what it seemed like i couldnt be more wrong from games like mtg and pokemon where mechanics almost never change to ygo where a new one is introduced every other year and it forces half the players to quit because it gets worse and worse to hs the ultimate softcore tcg i couldnt believe how tes legends achieved so much in inovation and freshness with just a few simple but well placed mechanics it really has to be tried to be understood from the fact that it offers somewhat of a story mode with actual content and choices which reflect on your collection and individual cards to the battlefield with two lanes each offering different strategic options via modifiers or simply via controlling the two lanes so you can manipulate your oponent into reacting in a manner that suits your intents there is clearly a great amount of thought and design put into this tcg and honestly as someone whos always fallen for tcg games this is one of the best ive played and the only one that actually takes advantage of being digital in way that enchances gameplay its a feature that ive wanted to see in a digital tcg forever in conclusion if you are a tes or tcg fan you deffinetely need to give this a spin there is always a possibility of it not being up your alley but beyond that and certain metabalance complaints that are always a given in tcgs there is absolutely no reason for this game to be not recommended its an absolute gem
would not recommend this game in its current state arcade is unbelievable and punishes players who try and are skillful realistic simulator and squadron battles are no longer legitimate playstyles because of esp hacking to which gaijin in all their glory only give temp bans to actual hackers then they ban players like myself for example for trying to stand up and say something without being vulgar or hateful no i wont recommend this game unless your an esp hacker or want to be ignored by gaijin period
fun and addictive little card game for old school anime watchers its a good memory flashback inducing ride the game has cool card entrances on boss cards can be played in pvp and even afk exp grind when you have nothing else to do overall eight out ten points if it wasnt so pay to win good cards are hard to obtain while f2p but not impossible its pretty bad to port from mobile to pci lost my first account to a dead phone and if it had more card entrance animation it would be ten out ten no questions asked overall check it out if you have time to spend
to make a gun simulation the graphiks need to be of top quality spesialy on the weapons them self this is if hl2 and doom got mixed in a blender and putt in to a edducation in guns guns and simulation is a great combo but they lack the game graphiks410game heroif u get the referance you are indeed a good gamer
this is so hard to steer i dont get it dont get it just dont its so hard to steer and dont waste ur money on the cars and tracks just dont get it i give it a bad review creeperhunter913
speakin as a person who likes the how to train your dragon series this game really sucks for real waste of time its just a cheap money maker for the peope who own it not worth the time and rather disappointed that such a blatant rip off of time and money would be on steam
early access reviewwell i am an active player of robocraft and i am really angry to see what freejam has done to the game they removed megabots before i got to use them im lvl forty three the new update has made it so new players like my friend get a rocket launcher while veterans still cant get these op weapons overall i dont like the loot ive been getting and there needs to be better match making thanks for reading
early access reviewfor years ive been looking for a game that had the complex card interactions of magic the gathering and the smooth interface of hearthstone this game combines those elements beautifully with wonderful fantasy art i recommend checking this game out this game does not dissapoint
"it says i only have twentyfour hrs on this game but in reality ive been playing since february of last year war thunder is a game for very patient people the first few tanks or planes to unlock are very easy to drive by but once you get into tier forty five its the worst without a premium account you can get an average of ten million, one thousand, five hundred rp per game which is very small when the vehicles youre researching are around 70000150000rp that means it can take between a week or a month depending on how much you play to get one vehicle in tier three the farthest i have gotten is tier four germany and that is with over 200hrs of gameplay this game is really only for people who are willing to spend their lives on it there is also an option to buy golden eagles to automatically gain rp but thats just a scam by itself another problem is the terrible matchmaking this game has ridiculous matchmaking you can either get downtiered very unlikely stay on your same tier could happen sometimes or get uptiered twelve brs which happens to me almost all the time its absolutely ridiculous and the devs do this to really just get you to buy more tanks with real money so its easier for you i personally have been forced to spend thirty on this game because of how painful it is to research tanks its ridiculous how the devs expect a t34 to pen a panther d why gaijin if you have all the time on your hands and have nothing else to do other than play games then this game could be good for you but if you have almost no time and have no money then this game is ridiculous and dont bother playing it if you dedicate your lives to games and spend as much as you can on them then this game is fine im not saying this game is bad its an excellent game but what im saying is that currently this game is out of balance and a pain in the a to play i will probably take a break from this game because of how bad it is right now"
this game needs work balkey controls advertising load screenes had to altf4 to quit the game because there didnt seem to be a let me get out of this game button flying was bad graphics were ok but the avitars need more options didnt even get to the point of choosing a dragon because of the suckfest that was this game
fun game but its extremely grindy and has the internet of an ea game if they put the money the got from children spending their mothers credit card into good servers the game would be playable being full of bugs even though people spend hundreds of dollars on features you should be able to grind for all the time time locking someone to get stronger is pretty messed up
i havent played card games much and downloaded this one on a whim im enjoying it so far the game does a nice job teaching you how to play easing you into it in story mode if youre interested in the elder scrolls universe its worth giving a go
early access reviewjust bad mtg clone fractions and cards are totally unbalanced everything is luck favored and there a so much random looses playing one match against a deck with just one mulligan after witch you have to keep the hand is so poor choice of a game mechanic it has all the bad design of the magic the gathering and all of dumb down decision making and grindyness of a hearthstone basically the worst of both worlds the freemium model is so bad and grind and with the random game losses from overfloods or mana screws its useless to try to take it as a serious game as always this will appeal to brain lazy people but i think hearthstone is much better for them then this not recommending this to anybody
early access reviewconsidering the game has already been out in other countries and failed this early access is really no excuse for their epic fail doesnt seem like they put that much effort into improving the game crashes lag no action cam combat is eh camera angle is eh overall it just isnt that fun to play i will stick with gw2 and bdo
everything about it is amazing but everything is too challenging and difficult to even unlock the third gun i should not have to pay real money to experience a game that claims to be free to play
early access reviewplaying for more than two months now and im able to get into masters without spending money on this game when it comes to being a free to play game i think this is the best for people not wanting to spend money since you can just grind ingame money playing against ai then play draft since playing draft is better than buying packs then you can save up some stones to craft some cards and build the deck you like
its exactly what you think it is progress through one thousands rooms of horror in cute style with lots of references to popular creepypastas and games definitely worth checking out and its free what else do you need for positive experience d
product received for freeearly access review1 you regenerate automatically medics are useless two theres homing weapons apparently who needs aiming three no variance in blocks armorweight why be strategetic with your building four no tiers because being a noob placed in the same room as pros is fun5 multiple types of guns on the same robot screw classes am i right six premiumeveryone is giant regenerating onemanarmy boxes with no promotion of teamwork tldr this game is garbage i heard a lot about it before but clearly something happened before i got to it
game has cool graphics but is only an online and has no career mode or offline play will not recomend this to friends sad really to say the graphics and physics are fab
i have been looking for a game like this for a long time finally a mmo rpg with a good combat system you can tell this game is made by gamers as everything about it is simple and well done all varification is simple and it actually is free like lol its pay if you want type content you dont have to pay to succseed in the game the pvp is good and there are fun events and updates best mmo rpg i have ever played the artwork is great and the game isnt very laggy even with my computer epic storylines and with a tool to let players create there own quests there is an unlimited amount of gameplay real credit to the makers of neverwinter fifty five star
early access reviewhirez ceo owner erez has nothing better to do than to diss a 19y old streamer telling him to play the game mode the way you are supposed to with a team and stop cryinghttps pastebin comgkqc8bgjanyway they are patching the game according to meaningless datanumbers and most of the people left the game allready this erez guy has no clue about game feeling i bet he never played rr himself not recommended since one month every patch they brought out made the game worse and the recent patch tops it allhirez obviously dont know how to make a good game better and instead they make it worse rr could have been great so sad uninstalled
this game is the best game ive ever played in years its better than minecraft and csgo combined with a little pinch of codi heard lebron james learned how to play basketball from this game im a nazi and i approve
ive played this game off and on for years and am still having fun there are a number of legitimate concerns that have been brought up with other reviews but in the end its a fun free to play game if you like flying driving tanks and blowing stuff up give war thunder a try youve nothing to loose the player base is a mixed bag ranging from frothing insanity to helpful and commited team players and everything in between if youre looking for a recommendation id suggest trying out the gameplay for a few weeks if you like the game even a little head over to the forums and find yourself a squadron to play with there are a number of dedicated training squadrons that exist to even out the rather steep learning curve having teammates with voip makes all the difference here i would not say to ignore negative feedback since there are problems with the game i would say to try it out right now and see if the issues are deal breakers for you
this game is amazing i dont subscribe to the this is what d3 should have been because its better than what i thought d3 should have been the gems and slots add a whole new element to items and skills i understand the desync argument but stay away from melee characters and set up a macro for it and desync is infinitely easier
early access reviewpeople keep trying to compare this game to hearthstone i just won a game with what would be lethal damage to me on the stack ill take hearthstone seriously when it has a real priority system that can let that happen
this game contains the dumbest most annoying stupidly ignorant developers of all time they make a game that looks great and is super fun to play but they cant listen to the community and its clear that they dont focus enough on how what they make will interact with the common player their community is made up of a bunch of garbage people that look for any form of exploitation with the game mechanics and over time that stupid little exploit defuses rapidly throught the community ultimately ruining the game for the rest of us the game is heavly meta based and the people that catch wind of this meta can easily learn it while playing a few matches thus the basis of this review the best part is once the developers learn of this new meta six months later they make changes that last for a good two months and the next best thing that was previously patched becomes meta once again its a constant cycle that never ends about a year ago this game was filled with people who ran away and waited for their opponent to attack to pound them to the next infinity an easy win this is a passive player now this problem was solved and the passive garbage people that once were dissapeared like i said earlier the cycle never ends so as of right now the passive player has returned because the devs want to encourage passive play and its now a problem that kind of playstyle is now back and has the same old meta return with it what im trying to say is the people behind this game have good intentions but theyre super oblivious to what goes on in their disgusting community it is unfair how learning meta ultimately gives you the advantage in the long run and ruins the fun until its patched the idea is amazing hence my play time but it is not worth your time its always the same with these kinds of fighting games people take advantage of what they can and ruin the fun for everyone else do not bother with this free game behind all the fun noises and cool looking animations is a community that constantly changes and quickly ruins the good experiences everyone else should be having
i like this game for the fast paced action the risk of losing everything and the deep gameplay which can suck you for hours and hours upon end rotmg was the first fast paced riskitall game that i have ever played and even though i dont play it so much anymore its still a good game despite the nexus you know what im talking about the really tough bosses and oryx himself i always will come back to this game and play it when im not playing tf2
an okayish free to play mobile game i wouldnt recommend the steam version unless your like me with a cellphone made of dinosaur bones and held together with spit and dreams honestly though this game should have been a pretty big sign that bethesda was going to absolutely dog bugger the fallout lore and cannon dont play it unless youve got a really crappy toaster of a pc and nothing else will run theres probably more entertaining flash games on newgrounds that wont try to nickle and dime you or waste every last second of your life and unlike games like girls frontline or kancole collection theres no cute waifus to keep you investedfapping like a degenerate so this game doesnt have much to offer even cookie clicker has more gameplay as you have to at least click the cookie a few hundered times to get yourself started properly also please god tell me no one has picked up the one hundred and forty dollar nuka cola quantum pack
early access reviewprobably the best alternative to super smash bros out there right now and with it being smoother in terms of movement more responsive and available for free on pc the only real things smash has over it is diversity familiar characters and complexity the weapon system however isnt flawless and although i like the idea of a character having two optional weapons they all function the same besides three special moves that resemble smash attacks from smash bros you have upneutral forward and downwards which is about the only differences between characters besides choice of weapon overall though this game is a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friends out of either not wanting to emulate smash and play through netplay or just not owning a wii u3ds this game is definitely worth getting
early access reviewgame was bad to begin with and then they went and removed the classes the main thing that set it apart from the over bloated genrei love paladins but leave it to hirez to make terrible decisions like these
all i can say is that this game has a lot of charm i look for games that i can personally connect with luck of the draw this one hits a soft spot the devs work on new stuff as we build with their new content so its constantly moving forward and progressing community is cool as long as you are respectful to each servers rules i personally do not hang out in my own spot as i have been helping out with about seven other talented builders in a different server btw new lore needs to be created for all them creepers creepin it real three you know who you are
early access reviewthis is a moba game with big spaceships and even bigger potential whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter but theyre definitely on the right track if the premise sounds appealing to you you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission its very well done however it is early access and as such there are a lot of missing functions some balance issues bugs and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed my biggest concern at the moment in terms of i want to have fun right now is the lack of tooltip details let me explain you get choices on which weaponsabilities to load your ship with however there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name so you kind of have to try them all and figure out how theyre supposed to work yes this will obviously be addressed but in the games current state theres sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve still once i figured things out i started having a ton of fun and im glad i paid the ten im having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces
elsword is a 25d actionpacked side scrolling mmo brawler with that certain anime charm it borrows a lot of mechanics and functionality from side scrolling brawlers and fighting games but simplifies them into an easy to learn experience while still retaining the intricacies and mastery that fighting games have been known for resulting in a game thats enjoyable for all kinds of players even though the game does not feature a character creator like most other mmos it instead opts to give you a selection of colorful characters to choose from which meant that the game had a lot more personality and flair going for it by comparison to other games in its genre while the game uses cosmetics and a payforconvenience business model you can pay for pretty much everything thats not account tied such as extra inventory space from the community market with ingame currency which is pretty nice while it is a really fun game to play especially with friends it does fall into the trappings that most korean mmos come with being their grindy nature and severely expensive item shops despite this i still give this one a solid recommendation to at least try it out because of the amount of fun ive personally had with it
early access reviewi tried to like this game but it fails in very important areas players spawn at different times players spawn in random locations guns are very imbalanced cannot edit any settings except soundthere were things i did like cool items that give intersting effects graphics optimization
when konami said were going to focus our market on mobile games nobody believed them then they released this game on android and it was a huge hit cheers for releasing it on pc too
i really recommend this game regardless of the tiny almost unnoticeable bugs the game offers great gameplay and its really fun to play with friends if youre into boardgames then what the hell are you waiting for its free and its amazing i just cant thank my friend enough for showing me this game its like monopoly some can say its even better the style of it is just nice and friendly a cool feature to implement would be text chatting with your teammate or opponent d
just a reskin of infestation survivor stories main diffrence is this is free and still being worked on not so sure about it that much as for infestation survivor stories has stoped development

business tour is the third game in the monopoly franchise making over four million dollars in the box office with an astounding yes on rotten tomatoes and a great score on meta critic i knew i had to review it so here are the cons for business tour online multiplayer board game takes forever to load the game up crashes if go threw the menus to fast has microtransactions you still make money in the lost island making people just sit there roll the dice and hope they dont get doubles has one map if you have coins which cost real money you can reroll the dice and make it so you dont lose game starts in windowed mode game starts with all sounds off the music is bad has loot boxes which can only be opened with coins from my knowledge you cant earn coins from just playing the game only from buying them and the chance square only has like ten different cards now here are the pros the four characters you start off with are mint the world championship lets you steroid one of your properties the festivals are a fun mechanic adding emphasis to properties you probably wouldnt of gone for before i always win repurchasing other players properties and then laughing at them is fun you can beef all your places up like crazy and most important of all im better than cavis at it i give it a three monopolys out of five
awesome i love how to train your dragon and i love school of dragons i have been playing this game for about a year or more i havent gotten bored playing it and yay how to train your dragon 3s title has been released woo woo
early access reviewhonestly it didnt start well i tried it during the free week and from what ive read about it it was a minecraft clone with paying early access that would be released later as a freetoplay game with cash shop starting with the cons after some hours i found out about the waiting game want to convert some blocks into crafting materials you have to wait for a processor to do it want to extract coal obsidian and iron you have to wait and the more precious the material is the longer you wait also you need to craft specific mining cells to gather blocks one for each level stone fossil lava etc and each cell only permits you to gather a few hundreds blocks maybe so you need to craft a new one every two minutes and gathering the materials to craft those cells can be really boring especially the flowers that grow on trees but there is an exploit you can use to get tons of them even the devs suggest that you use it all of this just screams were gonna make you pay to wait less like any stupid facebook game doesnt it something baffling too is that there is no portable light so you have to waste a lot of ressources crafting torches or lanterns or waste your time picking them up to place them elsewhere and as their radius is really small youll need hundreds of them there is also this stupid super jump bug people have been complaining since two thousand and fourteen basically sometimes when you jump your character will jump 50m high or more and of course when you hit the ground again you die losing all your inventory last thing its about the monsters they are everywhere you just cant dig anywhere without stumbling into a cave full of mobs its not really a problem in itself the real problem is the sound you will hear those monsters through the walls all the time because no matter where you try to build your house there will be a cave nearby ive spend hours filling a entire cave with blocks to keep monsters from spawning under my castle so i wouldnt have to hear them now the pros and why i finally bought the game and recommend it well first the devs put it for free for a week so they are pretty confident with their product and know its good after the bad first impression with the waiting game i kept playing more and more and the game itself is good i never played minecraft so i cant compare but i played terraria and starbound and i really prefer creativerse sure you have to wait to craft materials but you just need to craft several crafting stations to speed up the process sure you need to wait to gather ore but you can just put an extractor on the node and keep digging around then come back later to gather the ore in the end its no big deal if it stays that way its still ea but the game feels finished except for some bugs and poor performances most of the time dont know if its a gpu cpu or server lag issue but i dont think its because of my pc i have a gtx970 and an i7 there are really nice features one of my favorite being tnt digging and you can also craft a device that just removes a big square chunck of blocks its really quick you can also craft teleporters and configure them with codes by putting three objects to create the code so lets say a tp has three stone blocks as code and you build another tp you put three stone blocks as destination and bam youre teleported to the first one so you can really create a whole network of tp to fast travel anywhere like one tp on a beach to gather seashells another one in the snow if you need snow or ice etc exploration is really nice the world is big and full of different biomes caves can be really huge and take hours to explore the atmosphere is really well done too bad we need so much torches to light up the path because its mostly pitch black with ony some colored fog to highlight the cave at a distance objects and monsters design are nice too and most textures are pretty good however i find the building materials textures a bit ugly most of the time and its hard to build something that looks good i thought building an obsidian temple would look good but in the end its just a big blocky blue house also the character can rust fast and jump high controls are good too and for once the ui and inventory are pretty effective compared to terraria which was a nightmare to play all this makes a rather enjoyable experience so if youre looking for an almost finsihed game just buy it or wait for it to be free to play and possibly destroyed by a shtty buisness model hope it wont be though
its great truly this game is pretty awesome only problem dlcs more precisely their prices in lithuania for example to get all the dlc you need to pay eight hundred euros thats like an entire average job paycheck its redicilous and makes no sense good game pretty much ruined by greedy developersdont go all they need money to develop games and stuff thats not an excuse to limit the entire playerbase to the one imoheres some advice get il2 nineteen fortysixs for ten bucks install the cup mod and boom you have ww1 planes through to modern era jets with a lot of campaigns if you wish to install them and hundreds of hours of fun
product received for freeearly access reviewthis game use to be fun and ballanced smg fierd fast and did small ammount of damage per shot plasma use to fire slowly and do a large ammount of damage per shot you could fire infinate number of times with only one thing stoping you which was reload antiaircraft gun esealy destroyed flyers and hellishelicopters with a medium power need and reload of twenty three seconds you were able to buy mega wheels and mega smgs etc in the shop but now smg fire slowly and do a large ammount of damage and the things stoppig you is reload and a power limit plasma fires rapedly with small reload and takes medium ammount of power which seams unballanced because you can peak out and empty your power and hide antiaircraft gun hardly destroys hellicopters and flyers and takes a gigant power cool down with a medium reload of32 seconds but and here is a big one you cant purchuse mega smgs or smgs of higher tier actualy you can only buy begining tier stuff but the rest of it you can only get by supply drops or drops from chest which is totally unfair because freejam makes you buy drops supply drops and still you have to hope for stuff that you want and it starts turrning into a p2w pay to win which seams realy unfair and you aslo have to unlock stuff taht you want which wasnt already enought it us eto be fun but not enymore
early access reviewtruely amazing for a game the graphics give you a standered feeling of old retro gaming with nintendos number one it game super smash bros overall its a well made game with an amazing feeling to it
early access reviewthis game is going to be an hit ive played both cbt and was well impressed plenty of guns and skinsgame play very well made say good by to warface lol bryan u make me laugh to everyone go get game now and install the new must have game of twenty seventeens for free
early access reviewbrawlhalla is a great smash platform remake it is very fun to play with many people and has great strategic gameplay however the gameplay itself is the worst kind imagineable its servers are probably the worst i have played on ever ive explored to see if this is coming from my home internet connection but it is actually coming from the direct servers themselves every single game i have played lags immensly and is sometimes unbearable there needs to be a massive update for multiplayer and server performance
early access reviewthey killed the core mechanics with the last patch not worth playing until they fix that it might sound harsh but its really bad thats why they lost ninety five of their player base in one week
only played twentyone hours through steam as i only recently linked it but 100s of hours through the normal launcher uninstalled the game today due to gaijin the dev taking the out of their customers players with the furore over the rp cappartsfpe scandal great great run by an awful company
product received for freeearly access reviewi understand that the game should be fun and silly seeing as what it is but its downright unplayable the crosshair doesnt show where youre aiming the knife is a one hit kill and it seems that no matter how much ammo you pour into someone they wont die ive only been killed by knives because nobody uses firearms the movement is very bad and even though i have a low ping roughly thirty ms and high frames one hundred and twenty frame locked the game is very choppy when i corrected the volume so the enviroment wasnt too loud i noticed the gun fire was almost silent compared to footsteps doors ambient sounds etc i know i got it for free but what about the people that pay for it had i paid for it i would refund it almost immediately
played this for over two years used to be a great game once daybreak took over things started getting meh but it was still decent and playable then daybreak decided to hire one of the youtubers called wrel the brain damage of this red kid who thinks he can be a developer totally broke the games balance of course it did so mostly for one side if you absolutely must play this i recommend avoiding vanu at the time of writing this vs had nearly all of its unique features removed most recent removal rip lancer the remaining ones are honestly utter crp aphelion nerfed to oblivion ppa lancer or so very situational that theyre a joke when mentioned in combat lasher hill climbing which up till some time ago was a highly overrated ability of only vanu failraider has been significantly improved on other tanks strafing is a joke with the speed that tank shells travel at and the special abilities that other tanks have anchor shield are significantly more useful forgiving and newbie and pro friendly compared to what maggie could ever offer in terms of guns from the experience of two vs chars br one hundred and twenty and br one hundred and nine one nc br102 and one tr br107 vs guns are medicore they do not excel at anything supposedly jacks of all trades which is an obvious lie vs guns also have something called no bullet drop yet another thing that is highly overrated because it matters only on long ranges and even at that point bullet drop is easy to compensate for after some time but guess what the vast majority of the game is close quarters combat stick your nose out of the building die if youre not with a zerg why because of superiority of other factions tanks over maggie and other factions specific harasser guns over what vs has to offer nc guns heavy hitting with medium fire rate and very easy when it comes to controlling recoil also jackhammer a burst shotgun lol that can kill any character in one mouse button click la1 anchor is awesome gauss saw is one of my favorite starter weapons remember that deployment shield sundy next to a base well thats not a problem for a phoenix a rocket that you control from a safe spawn room while its slowly flying just get a friend to drop a c4mines while you keep the shield down tr spray and pray hello 909rpm lynx 896rpm armistice my personal favorites here were armistice and the burst sniper rifle trap m1 yea you can burst fire with snipers what about maxes well nc maxes are a long known joke ingame not in terms of funny but because they have been for sooo long and are so op with their instakill shotguns and yet nc still cries about them being only cqconly which has ages ago been proven to be a lie by a few youtubers sniping at medium ranges with mattocks and slug attachments oh they also have a special shield that blocks damage and two laser guided rockets launchers tr good weapons and anchor the same as their tank has basically you cant move but you gain massive bonus to reload speed fifty faster and shell travel speed thirty faster for the prowler and fire rate projectile speed and reload time fifty faster on a max its worth noting that you can turn anchor on and off at any time and it takes less than one second to get back to the normal mode to run away want to block a room get two anchored maxes with pounders aoe grenades and shoot at the door but hey what do vs have an awesome zoe at max rank this beauty gives you ten more damage output in exchange for receiving twenty more damage and this was still considered op by wrel thats a quote check his videos if you wish to confirm that if thats not enough then take a look at aircraft ultimate farming machines to which you will die way too often and which you will rarely ever kill because lock ons are so easy to avoidcounter by semiexperienced players and because they do crp damage and guess what almost noone bothers shooting at aircraft also empire specific fighters are damn quiet when flying slowly so they can and will sneak up on you and farm you over and over and over of course failbreak fails to see how broken these are so youre stuck with being a farming meatshield for an undefined amount of time moreover a while ago daybreak implemented an anticheat drug called battleeye into the game this did practically nothing aside from adding an additional clogg for your cpu there are still tons of cheaters check youtube for planetside two musclelittleman a video from a day ago reporting such people does literally nothing you will still see them all the time the biggest joke was a while ago when a guy with a name starting with literally obliterated anything and everything with an archer a very slow firing anti material rifle be it galaxies tanks people through walls etc etc etc and last but not least the requirements an i7 4770k wced overclocked from thirty six to 45ghz with an evga geforce gtx nine hundred and eighty ti hybrid wc i had issues with keeping this game at sixty fps and no were not talking ultra settings here no 4k or hd resolutions either i tried this at 1680x1050 at some point but it was unplayable so as you can see things are going only downhill for ps2 it used to be cool it used to be unique i loved the long battles the competitive gameplay and so many different playstyles and ways to approach each base but failbreak did its great job with hiring that wrel who wrecked this decent title into the trash that it is now conclusion avoid there are a lot better titles out there there is no point in playing a game where the so called devs create such an imbalance and claim its all ok ps large parts of the community are extremely toxic
early access reviewthis game is definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoyed counter strike cod4 or any similar old time shooters honesty didnt expect much from a f2p but ive been pleasantly suprised with this game theres absolutely no pay to win featuresunless for some reason you consider cosmetics pay to win the maps are small but balancedto those complaining about snipers the maps are clearly split into different areas with different lanes theres a crossmap lane for snipers and usually along the left and right hand sides of the maps there is a cqc or riflerange area for those who dont enjoy sniping the game is extremely fast paced and the matches arent long so its a pretty relaxed enjoyable game to play
this is without a doubt the best instancebased mmorpg anyone will ever play in the existance of videogames everytime i try a new mmorpg i end up right back where i started here i hit the one thousand hour mark in roughly three months this means that half of my life in that time period was dedicated to this beast of a game with the remaining twelve hours consisting of school sleep bathroom breaks and food so yes i absolutea ingly recommend this game but be warned if you play this game you will have no life however if you play this game with friends you will have no soul
i loved clicker heroes and i sure love hentai this is the best mix of my two favourite things ever i love iti only play with moans only because my mom thinks i dont watch enough pornim seven years old dont judge me hmphm
early access reviewthis game is like playing a dude that is drunk and he got on pans and bags on his arms when you go to try to aim its all slow and you have no control 123fps and it plays like one hundred and twenty three fps that will be a no for me dawg
ive played this game for a couple years now and have stuck by its side through thick and thin ive seen multiple update rages many update praises and so much more that doesnt even begin to explain the time ive had playing the game though tf2 has so many amazing things you can do and even specialize in you can pick from nine classes and several different weapon combinations within those classes to perfect your own playstyle technically speaking the game isnt limited to nine classes either slap a sword and shield on your demoman and you get a demoknight a completely different playstyle from the bomb lobbing drunk scottish man slap a gunslinger and a few good weapons on the engineer and you get the combat engineer a more aggressive member of the team who when played right can actually help more than you think theres so much more to the game than just a simple shooter with community servers running custom gamemodes that you wouldnt even expect to be in a game like this while not all are fun give them a try you may like them the community has its ups and downs but most communities have those occasionally you will find a really toxic player which can ruin the moods of many people or someone really salty or a troll but dont let them get to you try to be the good in the community and maybe things will change me ill admit i can be quite toxic and salty a lot of the time but i try to be good where it counts youve got hundreds even thousands of game groups all specializing in certain things in tf2 whether it be your favorite gamemode or a group dedicated to rocket jumping theres almost everything you could want from it updates a very controversial subject especially recently with the meet your match update i will admit when mym first came out i was part of the angry torch toting crowd bent on destroying valve but they very quickly noticed that the community was not taking too kindly to the update and made some announcements and changes valve doesnt always listen but when they do they do a good job of it theyve tried at least a little to fix the problem atleast give them credit for that give them time im sure well all come back to it eventually and valve will get stuff fixed up theres a lot and i really do mean a lot of things i havent explained here in tf2 you just gotta play it and find them for yourself whether or not you enjoy the game isnt up to me and i wouldnt feel any different if you hated it im not going to shove it down your throat okay maybe a littleedit the pyro updatejungle inferno changed the game up quite a bit which unsurprisingly sparked quite a bit of anger from people in the community i was angry with the update at first but as things started to calm down a bit it started to feel like normal again even if an update is good or bad give it some time and think rationally about the changes that are happening change is something people dislike so it comes as no surprise that when change happened people got mad give the game some time and focus more on the core of it all and im sure it will stay enjoyable edit two updates are few and far between so dont expect many to happen they do happen just not often the community atleast most of it i think has come to terms with the lack of updates and is kind of use to it at this point an update is more a nice surprise than it is a cool new feature or something at this point tldrplay the game dont get mad lots of features dont be toxic more than displayed try to enjoy games no matter what situation you are in people can be crappy just get through it and dont and fuel to the flames
first off i just want to say i loved this game when i was younger but now all i see is a true pay to win game second i was expecting that the beginners guide didnt changebut it did and in the worst way possiblei saw multiple people confused on how to open the cage lock and that is what most of gamers call a beginners trap now i see why everyone is hating this game please make an effort in changing the game not make it a easy cash game please
i like this game its really nice that they got tons of events and characters whats make this game never boring best moba i ever played tottaly not the only moba i played or somthing
early access reviewbuggy as hell cant play with friends armour is pointless any kind of mp wont kill past ten yards making them pointless trust me i have tried this over and over and over and everytime i die its to a rifle making my point even more valid i know its ment to be a joke and stab a pubg but tbh i would rather play pubg in the state its in atm as this game if you want to call it that is so far just a collection of assets edit people now make no sound at all you make all the noise in the world them nothing
early access reviewi would totally recommend this game this is the first game i played in steam and i totally loved it i am sure if u give it a try u will love it also its a lot like counter strike global offensive
product received for freethis game is good but it has sooooooo many bugs and the server lags so much many times i actually won the game but it didnt end it waited until i lose you know whats the most frustrating thing in the world its losing when u actually won
heroes and generals is now out of early access so lets take a lookexcellent foundation good technical achievements incredibly poor design choices and missing management that about sums it up but lets elaborate on that the foundation of the game the battles themselves as infantryman are good vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal the physics and gun system are good once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs but then there are things missing and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point flanking works well you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms but this is not really used that much you can use it all be the ultimate soldier and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets there is no penalty for dying not for you at least but more on that later and you dont really get rewarded for anything you do either you play to play and you win because you want to win then lets get right to the poor design choices this game is not just pay to win but pay to progress the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game do you want to group up with a few friends if theres more than two then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the skill of having a group after that prepare for a lot more grind as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades youre going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications because every single bullet shot grenade thrown mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot this leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentalitylife is cheap ammo is expensive if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because nine times out of ten it will be better than yours even if youve spend fifty hours on the game of course there are other issues mainly around balance and the generals portion of the game ill spare you the complaints on balance its the usual for pay to win games but more on that other bit later that said if you dont mind the grind and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours10 the basic infantry combat is good stuff moving along to tanks you will find that theyre not amazing but certainly entertaining and useful your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well airplanes are a joke and they likely always will be do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them controls are awful planes dont do anything and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything and then on to the big complaint with this game when youre not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money the generals part it may as well not exist the game may even be better if it did not exist the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it then you will need to spend three days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them they will die in about five minutes and they will have gained no experience everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the devs money for it which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy merely people throwing their units around hoping it works sometimes it does work too but this is never because of any skill at command it all comes down to the people playing the war battles and they dont care people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at because they dont have to pay for those tanks the guy who got the tank brigade does same for airplanes infantry spawns and vehicles why would they care that youve waited three days to get your infantry squad filled they will run into machinegun fire and then respawn to do it again until you lose your squad they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have one thousands infantry spawns and three hundred vehicle spawns and they fight one hundred and sixty infantry and ten vehicles and because these vehicles despawn after use they are gone and they remain gone the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun a game with great ideas pretty good technical achievements but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesnt care either greed above all else and a complete lack of awareness long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept good basic gameplay and claimed to have plans to make it better i wanted to support them since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great i regret that i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use the game isnt better than it was back then its worse and its showing no signs of ever improving
one thing i can say about this game is that the commnunity is a mixed bag you will see a lot of players online that just dont know how to do anything but stand still and spam moves on the ground which is jarring to me since i come from the super smash bros community and have played melee extensively despite this the game holds its place as one of the better couch party games on steam as its so easy to just sit back and play with your friends you will have a lot of fun playing with the vast selection of characters and even see new ones every now and then if you want to play a well polished fighting game and have an empty wallet pick this game up
my favorite free to play game i currently have two hundred and twenty hours in and i haven t spent a cent on it yes it does take some time to get more advanced planes but if you can be patient about it you can still unlock them without purchasing anything the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is intense you could get into firefights that could last up many minutes there s no reason for you not to try this game out it is also extremely optimized so you can play this game on a lesspowerful rig
"one thousand, five hundred hours of playtime time for a review so in the past ive written early review and i wasnt always happy about the progress of fixing problems but ater a while now ive discovered it is best to wait before commenting people arent always uptodate with the reported bugs when so an update is in the makingas for the gameplaydepending on your ingame graphic settings the experience can be altered by adding more or less options play single player multiple modes available to practice when your friends are offlinewhen online just battle each other my gamegear min recommanded for medium to high experience processor intel core i7 seven thousand, seven hundred memory ddr4 sixteen gb graphics nvidia geforce gtx ten sixtys 6gb memory ddr4 sixteen gb steering wheel thrustmaster t500rs with f1 addon two th8 shifters and pedals crew chiefv4 some additional packs from raceroom storeudate two thousand and eighteen so ive bought myself a medion erazer x1000 mixed reality headset to play in vr it has become a whole new game"
"early access reviewan impressive minecraft copy with nice visuals and good optimazed framerate this game is a lot like a game that is known for all of us minecraft you could say this is a graphically improved mc with new features pretty much a mod not only it looks nice it is also free to play and has no hidden costs being f2p the developers recently released a pro package giving some extras to those who pay one thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine the pro package will give a double stamina a glider custom maps increased inventory and some other things you can read it on the store page this is bad in a way as this will divide the gamers making this a little bit more pay two win however dispite this game being completly free i dont really see a huge issue behind this dlc you can think it as if you would be buying a game if twenty is too much right now then wait for the sales as i would recommend or go ahead and support the devs by buying the new dlc it is up to you skipping the previous this game is worth checking out"
"so my friend and i both got tf2 back when it was in the orange box and i played that for about two years then my pc died and i didnt play it for six years then got a new pc and started playing it again it was still good then i stoped playing it for about an other year came back to it about four months ago game was still good then the update came out seven thousand, seven hundred and sixteen and the game is now a copy of csgo dont get this once great game its now really bad if they change it back to the way it was i would tell people to get it but now no"
exceptionally pay2win game which is a shame because the game is actually well made even at the lowest levels the game lets you literally purchase so much power that you can be 34x as powerful as a free players on your level this is especially noticable in pvp where someone the same level as you can three shot you in less than four seconds regardless of your gear or skill level this is also ade worse due to the class balance letting some classes be 152x as powerful as others add pay2win on top of a op class and you have a nearlyliteral walking godmode that can solo party dungeons with ease avoid this walletwarrioring game unless your a whale
ive tried lol dota and a few other mobas but i just couldnt get into the isometric clickfest after having played the beta i gave smite another shot when it launched fifteen years ago and i never looked back more than a one thousands hrs later im still playing every single day it will take you some time and practice to get used to it all but its more accessible compared to other mobas due to it having less items and being able to turn on autobuylevel positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming timing communication and synergy making it hard to master the game is based on mythology from seven different pantheons and the sixtynine gods at the time of writing all have lore related directed taunts which adds a lot of humour to the mix five different classes eight gamemodes on five different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone regular updates and patches keep the game fresh with plenty of free gems events and sales you wont need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you dont want to i have accumulated 1000s of gems and free stuff in my playtime being the third biggest moba with second largest tournament prizepools in esports history i think i can safely say hirez finally hit the right spot with this game the only negative things i can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky which isnt too big of a deal if you dont play ranked leagues as with any online game you get a few toxic players every now and then but they can easily be muted or ignored and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your matches furthermore i can reccommend playingqueueing with friends once you get used to the third person and aiming turn off autobuylevel and use sites like tiermonster com for item builds the bots in coop gamemodes are horribly bad get into pvp as soon as possible read some guides and watch streams to improve your game if you enjoy the game get the ultimate god pack unlocks all godsfuture gods its the best deal in moba games vvgl good luckvvgf have fun910 would kappa again
"updated review seventy thousand, seven hundred and fifteen about the games flawsthis game includes two different game a before level forty easy enjoyable you can be kobe lebron you think so b after level forty when you face the real players including very high skill guys very good teams very heavy pay to win guys you will be shocked after playing against these guys you will think they are cheating you will be frustrated may be you will quit playing the game now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point before level forty this game may seem easy but it is not so after becoming level forty and even being a level fifty with good piece of equipment you are so weak put aside the p2w equipment cards which some of the cards you can aquire with in game currency and events but the best clothes are time limited so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent the real problem you still have no idea about this game passing at the right time finding the free teammate when to fake when to drive when to shoot all of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience average player needs thousands of games to be a competetive level fifty and for each different position you still need additional experience you need a good team or a good crew and the friendship mechanics crew mechanics are awful in this game so basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo you find a good guy he knows about this game so you be friends but only with that position you have no idea about his other chars at some point you have five chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game so there should be a main char name so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars the crew function basicly your team clan totally awful as a crew master you have so limited options you can not classify sort you can do nothing usefull you can only delegate managers accept players or kick players out of crew you have to spend enormous time to have a good crew you have to know each player well that is not practicable you must have as a crew master ability to see player stats i dont mean attribs but total stats or monthly stats as you can see yours i think you can not even see the level of your crew members lol you can see this during their application only you can not see inactive players as you can not sort anything you can not assaign them titles like rookie veteran pro or whatsoever to classify them which is a must in a serious clan crew based mmo the games lottery system prize system so rigged lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like one hundred points or even blank if the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting items it is okay but you see the wheel of fortune for example there is lets say twentyfour pieces one of them is one hundred points smallest prize you turn it ten times and five times you get one hundred points come on this is bs than put more piece and increase number of one hundred points this is like slot machines with cheating mechanisms casino wins all the time information given by the game about almost everthing is so small like three point attribute three point success rate which one is what which one includes what which is better no info what about tussle who needs tussle what is that so you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need because you have no idea there should be some graphical improvements like antialias may be there should be optimisation of network code still we have disconnects from match loading screens match would not start for multiple tiries some lags which affects gameplay a player three meters left of you can block you with the help of mr spock with a teleportation so final state of the game pros still great gameplay seems like devs are listening players after steam some of the problems are sorted out after steam release old the pros are valid from first reviewcons still p2w big gap after level forty with high levels gap with experienced orand p2w players awful friendship interface lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comms awful crew system flawed lottery system lack of information about the game stats need improved graphics need better network code old review i have been playing this game during obt i have one level fifty sf lvl thirtysix c lvl twentyseven sg lvl five pf also i had played fs1 long time ago so do not mind the steam play time first things first this game is pay to win p2w with earned points you can purchase items which will give you around five attrib but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to thirteen or even eighteen so this is the pay to win aspect of the game also there is the toy thing which can be p2wyou will encounter pg who can steal all your balls really annoying a balance issue much more than p2w although p2w makes them so strong at stealingaside from this i definitely recommend this game because it is so much fun you can level up to level fifty final and build a good player you can compete with others wallet warriors you can compete with others by team play and skill so if you have a good team crew friends yes you will enjoy this game if you like basketball yes you will enjoy this game beware you can not be a jordan or kobe trying so will gain you only frustration you need team play if you are high level with good items and skills yes you can be kobe mj not so sure pro nice graphics basketball online at best three divisions according to your level so you dont get smashed by high levels if you understand the game and be a team player super funcons p2w need somehow good ping obt players can be a bit unfriendly they do not have the patience for rookies noobs difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbei including cards toys and gameplay after steam release game is experiencing lag which i have encountered one in a fifty games series during obt so this is an issue now a major con was the low player base i hope it will change with steam this game deserves it overall seven thousand, five hundred and ten a great game if it was not p2w it would be a nine yes i do recommend no body is perfect btw i see most of negative reviews is due to absence of sea server so this guys want this game to fail instead of earning money and starting a sea server"
if youre looking for a challenging fps thatll give you hours of competitive gameplay aswell as an unique community and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative look no further team fortress two is one of the most fun amazing oneofakind games that ive played not alone does the nine different classes grow on you the game itself is amazing featuring unique fun gamemodes as payload or atkdef if youre not conviced just yet the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miscs community created aswelll as valves ownall in all team fortress is by the community for the community now i understand if you find looking at people and clicking hard or cook that grenade just right but in team fortress two you dont nessecarily have to theres much more to the game than just being the first to draw fire heck there aint even that many gunsto top it all off its free you might think ah then its a paytowin and youd be absolutely wrong with the unique drop system youll be sure to aquire new firearms by the end of the day if not a hat or two
early access reviewits fun and works damn well but i tend to rage at the game more than any other ive ever played and since its in beta it does have a few bugs and maybe slight hitbox problems otherwise its a great game
as someone who played hundreds of hours this game has become unplayable after the latest update how am i to play a match where it is ten vs five for multiple rounds no autoblanace no team switching no voting at all fix your game valve youve already lost me maybe you can keep other people
tes legends is fun welldesigned and has its own personality out of nowhere it has become a strong contender in the cardbased battle it s not as pretty as hearthstone and its lack of responsiveness is sometimes annoying but dire wolf digital tackled gameplay mechanics expertly making the elder scrolls legends hearthstone s main rival
an excellent game that involves both left and right hands with a little use of the tongue it also involves back stabbing team immigrants who love to spam chat and report any who stand in there way meanwhile in the air an army of fat fifty year old virgins with joysticks shoot you down and your family while they feed you pees overall an excellent serm producing game the still is better then of doodies ghoates
early access reviewahojthe idea behind this game is okay its pretty fun for a while solo and with friends the free to play model works and it feels okay not unfairat this very moment it got a little boring at least for me after nineteen hours of playingnot a bad game by any means is just highly repetitive and goal orientedsome people might like this not really the dream game for me but its good solid early access title had no technical issues playing this game thumbs updo i recommend it yes have fun jumping in three hundred and twenty one

i have never played a game as much as i play smite since mid to late season two i have had the wonderful oppurtunity to play smite as my first moba ever all the iteams abilities and skilled players were very intimidating at first but the growth through the game was truly an amazing feeling many people hate that smite has changed so much but personally i am thrilled with every change they make because the beauty of this game is how power of items and gods are always shifting and changing allowing new play styles and ways of stratgey this game has truly shaped me on a realistic level as me and my friends have bonded over it if you are thinking of trying this game you must i personally believe there is a bit of a learning curve but once you find your perfect character and get your first victory then positive kd then penta and all the way to placing in ranked you will hopefully find as much enjoyment as i have i will continue to play this game for a very long time and will proudly declare smite to be my favorite game
early access reviewa great game for its valuealtough all the hatetroll reviews out there this game is not that bad it is actually kinda good and fun when you start playing it the only thing this game needs is better servers you will often see player models do some mini teleports or rubberbanding and no balance d witch is something i actually thing makes this game fun to play because there is almost no recoil in the guns enabling you to headshot so easily
early access reviewfun game shame the pay to play scale is more towards the side of pay to have fun otherwise youll just get on but i can definitely see that it would be fun if youre willing to throw money at it
considering its an idleclicker there are many different paths that prevent the game from becoming mindnumbingly repetitive the bane of many clickeresque games every time you reset to gain new bonuses the multitude of achievements also give you a sense of purpose and a goal to strive for for a game i initially downloaded to idle in while offline ive somehow spent a lot of time ingame since the game was and still is freetoplay i told myself i had nothing to lose in giving it a try but trust me it wont be long before that first click becomes just one more clickenjoy and click at your own risk
the game feels very cheap i couldnt change from controller back to keyboard and the controls in general are poorly chosen also there are limited free cars most you have to pay for
when you want to like a game but cant how to refund all content i actually bought starter pack spa track forty five just to compare with other games that im playing ac acc rf2 gt4 i tried and must say it cant be compare to gtr2 physiceven when they added more but its no longer fun and i cant feel the car like i did in gtr2 even worse than ac i think its time the developer should realize this is a game and its realism must make sense instead of pure math and trying to add things that we cant feel through eyes and hands graphic even more fancy but still cant compare to great tone ease on eyes and ui design of gtr2cars tracks maybe more but saying good bye to your ferrari and lamborghini perhaps mclaren and mercedes amg will be your best friends i just dont feel right i want to refundddd end of story ps i love simbin games like gtr2 and really hope they make gtr3 the same less is more sometimes guys what end user feel is more important than mathhhhh
been playing since orange box though did get heavily into it until a few years after that rewards skilled players but not inpenetrable to new players still gets new content despite having become freetoplay for a long time now ticks a lot of boxes for me scalable engine linux native competative shooter active community some things have changed for the worse but over all its a great game youd be doing yourself a disservice not to try it out
early access reviewi was very skeptical about this game when my friends were trying to convince me to play as i am not a fan of battle royale style games normally i was quick to change my mind when i actually got into it with a group of friends and we were running a four man fireteam the map is large but there are many ways to traverse it assuming you take the time to plan to make the most of your forms of transportation gunplay is intense as the game accounts for velocity and bullet drop with smgs and shotguns feeling lethal in close combat while the dedicated sniper riflesif you can find a scope for them actually give you the ability to get kilometer standoff distances assuming visibility is good the assault rifles cover the middle ground with some tending more to feeling like smgslike the groza and m4 while others tend to be better at longer rangeslike the lvoa and akm the vehicle physics are absolutely legendary you can drive trucks up eighty slopes at 60kph and given the ridiculous terrain features this is a huge plus and leads to some hilarious moments as well the graphics are good nothing exceptional but when you reach a mountain peak or are riding in the ski lifts scattered around the map you are blown away by the fantastically designed landscape the game is surprisingly optimized as well im playing on a laptop with a gtx1060m and a fourth gen i7 and im usually around one hundred and twenty fps on the high settings even in intense firefights or the snowstorms that occur as a battle royale i give this game a nine hundred and ten its a simple game you grab guns you get attachments you follow the zone you kill the enemy teams it doesnt do anything groundbreaking while at the same time having enough small changes to the formula to make it stand out and actually be worth playing with your buddies as a whole game experience seven hundred and ten they supposedly have a pve mode coming sometime next year as well and the pvp has given me enough of a reason to stick around to see where this goes
playing on conquest going mid lane and i see a couple of minions on my way through the jungle and i say hey ill just grab some ex ra what the f meeerrriiicccaaa freedom rang and it was loud1110
ive only played the game for a little under three hours at this point but im really enjoying it so far its like league of legends but in space i am a huge fan of space sims and mobas and this game does a great job of putting the two together also i really do love the fact that ships can maneuver in full 3d space not just along one plane but up and down as well i think it shows great promise and will continue to play
early access reviewspace shooting action controls are tight and precise taking a bit of time to get used to and combat is crazy at times but it all adds to the funnow though im not sure i played this when it first came onto greenlight and since then i joined the military if only my military issue internet was worth a damn i could actually play it
early access reviewvery well optimized game runs at fix one hundred and fifty fps with a mediumlow end system artstyle is more like world of warcrafthand painted textures than fortnite i think its looks good has different characters with different abilities and weapons looting system is very simple you can craft you own legendary armor from shardsthat you get from disenchanting loot that you dont need so its not a rng lootfest if you survive to the endgame you will always have twelve legendary items just like your enemies good game overall
be mesoulless weeaboo that is trying to look for a f2p game with boobsone day looking at the store page of steamsees sakura clickerthe name didnt appeal to me but hey what do i have to lose for free hentai downloads game at lightningfast jpegenter gameclick oncehear a moansatisfiedas lualet me hear some more of that moanand thus a game where i can finally play with one hand and while the other faps is born
tried too hard in this game so called op classes are going to come in and ruin your day with the power of dank memes pvp player base is stupidly mind boggling when they call you laggers instead they are the ones that are lagging and are looking for safe zones where they will think they are the ones not at fault then there are the ones that straight up yells you noob ayy lmao nine hundred and eleven
this is a great horror game beaten it in one sitting the soundtrack is what really makes you stand on your toes all the time it adds a lot of tension and atmosphere to its locations and rooms and chases monsters are straight up terrifying dont let those cardboard cutouts fool you probably one of the best horror games ive played this year also this game has really good references without saying it get it bad ending is the best ending
meh skip all the lame recycled dialogue and cutaways and you would have just another generic p2w grind ccg there are many others that have have made cash grabs i mean ccgs like these exceedingly better bethesda has really turned into a manure producer
its alright to be honest not very noob friendly many mechanics are confusing or not properly explained and need a wiki search or two to understand to piggyback on the previous point some mechanics seem purposefully obscure can be difficult to know what your build needs to progress or get better and may find yourself relying on the community for help art community is great some people are helpful about builds on the subreddit the official forums are pretty build guides are often inaccurate or misleading and are updated for current patch despite lacking promised content from leagues ago such as videos clearing bosses or else vouch threads are useless as no negative comments can be made cant really trust anything especially considering the tos scammers usually get their way and you dont if you want to look good be prepared to pay lots of money nearly all of the ingame items have terrible ingame art that doesnt adjust properly to character model and size does not fit with any other armour and clips through most things in fact even the mtx that costs some four thousand and sixty dollars will only fit with its own pieces and no mind is paid about how it interacts with other mtx or ingame items fashion is very hard and very pricey after four years and still there is no ability to save a preset of your hideout so you may spend dozens of hours designing your home and wont be able to carry it over to the new league read more about leagues interesting game designall things considered the game plays pretty well i would avoid hardcore even if you like to play games for a challenge i like playing on hardest settings but for this game most deaths are out of your control and will cost you hundreds of hours of gameplay worst case scenario
early access reviewthe respawn system delays the gameplay for so long because you spend ages running toward the objective to be immediatly kill by someone camping the objective in an awkward spot to kill and if youre a newcomer you dont have any weapons to combat this so the game becomes a running simulator plus the gunplay isnt anything special feels kinda clunky
nice and fun game personally i hate mobas but made an exception for this one it is fun to play and addictive also third person view something i really liked compared to imo theâ â â â â â viewangle from common mobas
you get hats you sell hats for more hats it is a vicious cycle once you get more hats you sell those for more hats hats are everywhere all hail gaben the lord of savings all hail valve the lords of hats
https store steampowered you want to ruin your hole life this is the perfect game for you you will lose your will to live in just seconds niceee
this game is a mixture between world of warcraft and diablo it plays like world of warcraft with the same viewpoint same looting systems and gameplay etc ie doing pvp gaining glory in order to buy pvp gear doing heroic dungeons to get epic gear at max level but it then has a diablo twist with the same style gear system and ability system where you have a limited number of spells and you have to choose the best builds loving the game so far and played seventy hours i would recommend to everybody
this is a fun game can be a little unbalanced at times and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team but it is fast paced within only a day of game time ive already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank i think this game has alot of potential edit after a few days of grinding i think its only fair to update my review first off the teams are rarely useful tier iv tanks are also rarely useful i cant tell you how many matches ive played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself which only dooms your team and dont even get me started on the huge gap between tier iv and tier v tanks at leas in tier i iv you can damage the enemy ive played the german japanese and american skill tree working on the russians now and i can tell you tier vs are way too over armored even using premium ammo i only damage them maybe one out of ever six shots and its never enough to actually contribute grinding in this game to get from tier iv to tier v means you join as many battles as you can and watch your win ration slowly go down earning a mear one hundred and fifty to two hundred xp per match until you have the staggering 15k xp it takes to research a tier v with all that said tier i iii is super fun and usually fairly balanced i still see potential in this game
it s a good game the gameplay are similar to diablo damazing plot incredible quest and good history the only negative in this game is when you start the game it long time to begining
early access reviewhow to playstep one make a robotstep two kill other peoples robotsstep three upgrade your robotstep four repeat and waste ten hours a day playing this game1110 would play again
early access reviewthis game started off great but as it gets patched more and more the hit detection gets worse the latest major patch rommel broke it entirely there are numerous threads about it and the devs response has been to blame it on the player base stating its clientside lag it is not watch some of the videos it is a free game but after a round or two the frustration of the broken mechanics kicks in and will have you looking for a new shooter
you used to be able to take more than four shots but now every death is about four shots everyone hits criticals without any trouble bombers are no longer flying fortresses like they were they are just bigger four shot kills this game is no longer any fun
the most fun part arena drafted deck locked behind currency either rl or ingame grinded every game is mobs mobs mobs ends up super boring to just spam creatures on the table f2p grind for cards is nice that it can be targeted puzzles fun pve story decent fun but both only have a small pool of availability upfront need to grind dailies or spend rl money to play more
increadible game with a high chance of getting addicted great reason to return for every new challenge league and regular huge updates the reason i started playing arpgs and it is still absolutely amazing after over five hundred more hours
early access reviewi didnt play this game very much but the parts i have experienced are very repetitive i t has a battlefield like gameplay but with much more variety in things to do it has vast maps but for some reason seems to fall back behind the big name titles as far as entertainment goes
war thunder is a good ww2 warplane video game for the pc and ps3ps4 but not balance some planes are over tired and some are just low tired some planes are so bad it is impasible to fly and shot down other planes with but still one of the best ww2 warplane game out there
the game is a lot of fun so far a lot of people are saying once you get to tier thirty four ships its massivley unfair but i havent experienced that im not doing as good as i was in the recruit league but i generally am getting more kills than deaths and most of my deaths are because i put myself in a bad position or something
ive played this game for years on kongregate and when i saw it on steam i downloaded it immediatly this is a great rpg game that makes you collect and better yourself with quests and loot however this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience you can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them i strongly suggest getting this game if you have a friend or two to play it with
its a fun time waster and once you get it down you dont even have to spend money to progress at this point sending a few bucks on gems is just to support the maker am at reincarnation eight with out really trying to speed through
early access reviewlatest update killed the game devs went full sellout mode on pay to win people use wall glitches to their advantage unbalanced teams t akes forever to join a server and when you do and die you are stuck in a queue respawn timethe devs dont even have their own server to test their patches on they rely on us to test the game out very disappointing game use to be fun when you do finally get into a game your at the end of a match and spawn in to tons of tanks spawn camping your caps game went to complete
super addictive game that satisfies my need to play progression based games some may consider is super grindy but it is not a game you have to babysit two hundred and forty seven necessarily going freetoplay is entirely viable but i will not deny that spending money gives a huge advantage luckily there is only one pvp element in the game that this can really effect
early access reviewthe game should not be released to the public everything is wrong the escape key only opens the main menu and wont close anything or skip the cut scenes quest are bearely tracked and the ui is one of the worst graphics are comparable to runescape but worst the controls are awful there are no parties so staying grouped with friends is difficult i cant name one thing i enjoyed the controls are awful your camera just snaps all over the place overall 010controlls 010gameplay 110graphics 010ui 010sound ten
this review is totally honest i spent hours upon hours on this game it was a horrific and quite a sad journey to reach the not bad skill bracket everything in this game from the toxic community to the rage i have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did after the fifteen hundreds hours i questioned myself what did i do this for the fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that i chose to play ten hours of dota two before my exam the result was an e grade which is not bad is it could it be that i watched ti6 and ti7 and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions whatever the reason my family despised me for what i had become in short dota two is a game which is not free to play it requires you to sell your soul to the devil valve and leave your current life for you to become a legend
one thing you need to know is perhaps in eight hundred of the one thousands rooms absolutely nothing is happening once you realize that the game completely loses its horror thus while in the beginning i was nervous that faded away and the game became simply boring and tedious while i can see how many people sincerely enjoy this game unfortunately i have to say that i feel more like it wasted my time with me waiting for something cool to happen
early access reviewits twenty sixteens now after the dec update and arrival of new space ships this game is now one hundred enjoyable yure never going to regret buying this game not after the epic battles yure going to be in it will make you feel good in both victory or lose one thousand and ten nice job devs
unbelievably unbalanced some cards are game breaking and some decks are way too overpowered without any decent banlist to balance things not to mention that its clearly pay two win but its a free to play mobile game so thats kinda expected
i had to write a review about this game because i have noticed the amount of this game has been getting lately and with over one thousand hours i feel as if i am more than qualified to do so yes war thunder is not a perfect game gasp and i too have had my fair share of frustration at times but when i sit back after a match and think about what i did wrong after being completely on nine times out of ten it was my fault not angling my armor properly being impatient and pushing so far up i get surrounded etc thats what i love about this game when you screw up its on you people are quick to cry wolf on the russian bias those people are also the ones who dont angle flank and mindlessly take on a heavy tank from the front this game requires a plethora of skill which you will eventually require through practice and perserverance learn your tankplane know your weaknesses and your strengths this will help you tramendously in any situation if instant gratification is something you are looking for theres always cod gaijin does a wonderful job updating the game fairly fast and you can see they really do care about their community they keep us updated and add new content almost every other month they also do an excellent job hyping the following updates giving players something to look forward to in the near future cough cough boatsbasically if you want me to cut the and get straight to the point of this reviewdo not play this game if you are easily angered or impatient you will not surviveif you are new to wt give it a try for yourself instead of looking at the comments this community really likes to whine dont let the comments plague your experience most importantly have fun try not to think too much and ill see you in the skies o7
early access reviewi played this game mostly in early access came back to it after a while and it still pretty much sucked sure you could make robits but the matches were always really unfair today i came back to it today i realized how terrible it truly is the crack heads that made this should be shot for ruining such a game that could be wonderful
i came i saw i clicked not necessarily in that order in all seriousness the game is a simple anime clicker click to damage the monstergirl on the screen and gain gold at their defeat its an ok time waster for the hardcore anime fan but nothing to write home about ive gotten to the point where upgrading costs trillions so pacing has gotten quite slow for a free game its ok not gonna win any awards but then again i dont think that was ever the case still worth a recommend if just barely
product received for freeearly access reviewinstalled this game in twenty fourteens and have been addicted to it 1000h play time however the game became less and less of what i joined it for build drive fightthe removal of tiers seemed like a forced decision to keep queue times low and led to a huge amount of sealclubbing which was fixed by successively breaking the game more and more veteran players have been screwed over by freejam time after time to me the most significant break with old players was when megabots were removed a few hundreds of hours of playtime were completely wasted not counting the hours needed to build the bot the last epic loot update which replaced the currency based economy with a random crate reward and ridiculously increased prices of everything added the last bit that was needed for me to remove the game i waited for the state of the game update today and since it does not look like fj is willing to change their game back to what i and many others too liked im out gg fj
i still remember those innocent days in which i played cookie clicker and clicker hero never would i have imagined myself to reach a lower point in my life i wonder to this day what i had done wrong in my life to get to this point of playing sakura clicker for hours non stop
game is just average it feels like a combination of archeage and black desert online but stripped of any engaging content or fun ive spent all my time doing lame story quests with average voice acting or killing hundreds of mobs the only thing i really like about the game is the mount animations and your character tilting when you turn while moving both the fps counters from steam and geforce say the game is running at 60fps and the world feels smooth but it feels like the movement animations were created at 30fps not sure if im going to keep playing bless this game has strangely made me want to go play gw2 again
played this a ton late last year ton of fun decided to come back and give it another shot classes for credits only nope not happening trove going the way of archeage two great games destroyed by the same greedy publisher
one of the best most in depth game i have ever played the graphics are incredible especially when you crank the resolution all the way up and supersample at 4k boobsboobs would play again
early access reviewi think eternal should exist because people have different tastes in life having said that i dont really support the old scheme of resource draw a k a lands or sigils in this game the concept of mana floodscrew is a problem that shouldnt exist the way eternal manages mulligan is clever but not enough even if you vomit your resource theory it doesnt matter how pro you are if luck just screws you on the other side i have to say that eternal had the best freetoplay scheme however like any other ccg whilst expansions start to hoard new players will have an increasingly difficult time to build a collection no matter how generous the game it was in the beginning if it doesnt scale with the increased card pool at some point you start drafting the same cards over and over so you end with little to none value even if they give it to you so as a final veredict i stopped playing eternal mainly because mana floodscrews it became expensive in time to farm resources the return value is pathetic and balance can be tricky sometimes however i dont think it is bad at all if you are mtg fanboy you should give it a try otherwise run from here and try something else to avoid wasting your time
gud game with good voice track that could stimulate your five senses to peak performance not to mention great seductive art that helps to improve your finger clicking skills five hundred that enable you to finger to any gurls heart say good bye to solo lyfe hello to chick magnet achievement unlocked
"early access reviewoverall i would recommend this game i am a girl who does not game often but when i do i like to play games that have some sort of strategy ability to alter your apperance and a time limit i get bored doing quests and builiding up levels for what who knows this game however has a few fun aspects one there is a time limit you are dropped in remote locations to gather weapons and loot while ymir a blue cold frost spreads if you get caught in the cold it harms your health this is a quick achievalbe goal that tests your skill when you get caught up such as in a vehicle ambused in town by an opposing team50 players in the game in teams of twelve and forty two there are three ways to quickly transport in game ziplines hand gliders and snowboards giving each game its own unique round a different strategic approach3 your apperance is somewhat customizable with various outfits and makeup to choose from i admit i change my outfit before every game4 you can carry multiple weapons from snipers to shotgons ars and smgs with mutliple scope attahments5 the loading time isnt that long ive waited mabye three minutes tops just enough time to go get a snack or run to the bathroom6 the end goal is to board a helicopter before the whole places freezes and its fun at the end i end up screaming in entertainment even if i dont win7 it is winnablethings i would change one ability to shoot when downed waiting to be revived2sensitivity on scopes and camera in general i took mine down to one thousand, five hundred and twenty and prefer it over the preset five hundred and three the snow seen makes its really easy to spot people but there are just enough rocks trees and hiding spots to get to the end of game4 upgraded vests and helmets sometimes they protect me sometimes i am like i shot this guy in the head three times and he kills me with one shot from a pistol aww hellll nahhhh overal recommend yes"
its a very slow burn of a game but im not sure if theres actual payoff after three hundred rooms it just felt like this was a hallway simulator with a rare jump scare you would think with a name like house of jump scares that it would have too many but no it doesnt really have too much of anything except hallways kudos on the horror pop culture references but im not sure who this game is for its too cute to be spooky and too dark to be cute

ive been playing dota two since december twenty elevens and i really like most of the aspects of this game dota two is great for players who aim for competetive gaming but is equally good for casual gamers who play for the sole purpose of enjoyment one of the features of dota two which i like the most is its everevolving meta gameplay which changes from time to time just when u think youve figured out the meta a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explorelearn and adapt to the changes this changing metagame not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the professional scene a champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams the beauty of the game lies in its ever evolving nature the more u learn about it the more u fall in love with it recommended for all gamers who have a thing for strategy games or want to try out dota two beacuse of its huge community

early access reviewfor this game being in alpha it isnt that bad i would recommend this to anyone who likes space gamesand it is fully compatible with the steam controller which works great
early access reviewfor the six hours i played nonstop mind you i have to give this game a lot of credit a friend bought this for me after telling me about it and i was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to minecraft but there is a lot of differnces between the two games the structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing minecraft its not as easy as chop some wood mine some stone then youre good to go there is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone while it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need you need a lot of them even after you collect them you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different matterial for example breaking vines down into twine yes you have wait times on crafting stuff while it isnt too terribly bad the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as obsidian iron and diamonds but in my opinion it adds more to the game because now you have to wait five minutes to advance and in that time you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking the creatures in the game is definitely unique while some do remind me of creatures from jak and daxter the night pigsys and night leafis they still have a unique vibe to them and they of course vary in difficulty while a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage there isnt a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance also there is furniture and to be honest it actually looks pretty nice there is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends you have different types of carpet walls and even slanted roof planks you can craft you even have different colored lamps you could use them like my friend does and make each room different colors though the blue sometimes confuses me because i never know if it is dark out or not but it still looks really nice much like a room with a bunch of black lights to add on to the crafting idea to the game you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game you have to work your way up and find the recipes while some of them are scattered in chests around the world you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else like weapons for instance after you craft a wood sword you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword which means you have to work to find better things meaning you actually have a goal to work towards while there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access it still runs fairly smooth and its easy to play with friends no port forwarding or setting up custom servers simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up even when you are offline they can still join the world and continue which to me is pretty awesome i would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes minecraft or sandbox games in general and i think if you actually take some time with this game youll find there is a lot of possibilites with it
early access reviewwould be a great game if not for the fact that the prebuilt decks have a horrible habit of drawing either all sigils or all summoning cards nearly every time i play against a real person only way youre going to win is if you get a balance of half sigils and half low level summoning cards or pay out the
early access review be me looking on the f2p list because i have no money rn sees this trailer looks good downloads sees that reviews are mixed sees comment shotgun with the range of a sniper wonders what i got into game done downloading in like half a second goes into game tab to check the scoreboard looks on menu and figures out theres no way to look at your ping goes to options and then graphics has thirty five options quits from poor hit detection am now here tldr dont download its so bad right now still in early access maybe it shall get better later
imagine this the perfect game a flightsim paradise with a mix of arcade fun where you can fly multiple planes imagine this game also had tanks tanks that players use imagine you being able to go between a plane and a tank sounds great right now imagine that the devs behind this game completely not care about the community flight models broken in every patch planes being crippled ww2 planes matched against korea era jets and now sprinkle a bit of devs decide what you play and how you have fun then stick a big stinking huge grind to get anywhere on top a game where the devs force you to play specific races penalize you for doing good in planes and utilizing them as they should and then force you to pay money to lessen the grind a grind which increases with every patch they release dont forget the fact that they keep lessening the value of everything in game and raising the prices for less reward whats that want a pack with a premium plane sure say the devs but well charge you twice as much turn two months of premium into two weeks and completely over the premium plane as wellthat is warthunder where the devs have opted to cash in and lose their playerbase
had to edit this review fair warning it was originally a negitive not because of gameplay glitches or the devlopment team it was because of the lack of players i want to tell you this game is amazingly addictive it i hope that its community expands because even if the player base is small i still wait to play another match its that good graphics are impressive yet the game system is optimized so well its not clunky to play on the gtm six hundred and fifty this is something alot of early access games struggle to do and the fractured space team has achieved it with what seems so easy
great game constant free content updates that change a lot of game mechanics every three months there are new unique build enabling items developers care about the game and fix bugs every time they pop up couldnt recomend this game enough
meh not very well made clicker game while i do like the art and upgrade system overall it looks like it was made by a student no fullscreen and it gets slightly laggy when you click really fast not even talking about clickers waited for a minute for it to become responsive again
well as this game sits open on my desktop i write this i was gifted this game from a friend in brazil when you still had to pay fifteen to get it so he payed for it so that i could have it well according to certain restrictions i could never play it that wasnt the developers fault but when they made the game freetoplay on steam i felt kind of bad that my friend payed for it and i couldnt play it that was a redundant story but its how i got where i am the game constantly popped up in my recommended list and today i finally decided i will try this game it has good reviews and i mean it was free after all installation was very quick but it all fell apart after that i opened the game for the first time and i had to enter my date of birth to accept the eula a total of twentythree times yes i counted it never ended up working so i closed the game to restart it seeing if that fixed my problem well that did fix my problem it brought me directly to what i assume is the main page however even though the game says singleplayer on the steam store page it wouldnt let me do anything from the main menu i was brought to the faq and changelogs and the x button closed my screen i tried clicking the free recipe button several times but all it did was shake rattle vibrate and intimidate me with failure i closed the came once more to attmept to restart and i got the same problem i took my time to move my window around the screen in order to read the rest of what was scrawled at the bottom of the window as the game launched with some strange resolution that was blocked by my windows overlay and where i was getting at before with the stem store says it has singleplayer it said the creativerse servers were down and i could not play so i closed the game and went and did something else for about ten minutes i returned and said third time is the charm so i opened the game this time it approached me with the eula agreement once more i filled out my info and it drug me to character creation and after a long drawn out process to start i eventually was able to start to enjoy the game and honestly despite the bad first impressions the insanely loud audio and the strange resolution the game is pretty nice once you figure out how to fix those problems
wow this game has really caught me where i am most vulnerable the nostalgia everything in this game reminds me of the good old rpgs like risen gothic etc from the music to the graphics its just perfect good nostalgia the gameplay is really fluid and good all the classes seem balanced dungeons are randomly generated i could go on like this forever but the biggest point of interest for me and maybe you aswell is the fact that microtransactions are almost entirely cosmetic and the game never really throws them into your face like a lot of other f2p games tend to do if you decide not to buy anything from the shop it doesnt really hinder your progress at all and you can still continue on without noticing any difference1010
early access reviewrefunded after four hours not because of the typical mmo launch problems like downtime and server laginstability but because of the god awful performance and the terrible googletranslate translations thought i could get past those things seeing as its early access but its a bigger deal to me than i previously thought might wait for it to go f2p as the game itself isnt terrible its really no surprise it failed in so many other markets before the westernna launch devs just seem incompentent two year old problems are still present in this version of the game and i really dont ever expect to see those issues fixed spend your four thousand and thirty elsewhere and just save your time with this piece of trash only thing this game brings to the table is a new open uninstanced world thats about it
after a very long time of taking off from this game i wanted to give it a shot again the game refuses to run literally does nothing after playing play in the launcher im just to tired to try to fix it on my own this game always had faulty client even before steam release i convinced all of my friends to forget about the client issue as each and every single one of them faced a different problem diagnosed all of them back then when the support team gave me the automated message right now i feel too old and tired to fix it ill delete it before giving it a try such a shame
early access reviewevery update they didnt listen and they removed everything what made this game different from the rest its total trash now dont bother trying it out its in its last breath
early access reviewan interesting game to say the least the lack of a u s server doesnt bother me much the biggest andmost terrible issue is actually that the game doesnt fully shut down through steam some background task or something i dont know either way going through task manager and processes and programs whatever i cannot find this forign proccess to close down in order for steam to say the game is not running any more hence why im un installing the game after so many hours and force ending steam boostrap just so i can update my pc good game not so grindy at low levels didnt make it past lvl thirty so but yeah seems fun wlying right off the bat is nice too since the first available dragon has wings lol taming is a simple reverse direction game kinda like reverse sumo wrestling d the distinction between tamable dragons and untable is not apperant think someone who is good at it should be able to tame just about anything quick bar could use the ability to be changed from default keys to custom num pad keys would be great also as far as changing keys maybe being able to set look to arrow keys instead of mouse would be nice but the greatest problem is the inability of the game to end for steam without ending steam itself
early access reviewthis game took a direction you are not even able to play duos anymore this is literally the worst duo game experience i have ever had i honestly regret giving this game a chance and i cannot recommend this game to anyone if you are looking to play with your friends and if you dont have friends then this game is great
product received for freeearly access reviewvery good game much like call of duty but still a lot of skill involved if this game keeps updating and getting better this could be a big game
brilliant fun game to play very immersive the game is f2p but ofcourse with limitations you can get around not paying a penny so long as you do the missions but this method will be very time consuming im happy to support the devs on this game they have provided an enjoyable game and deserve to be paid its a hard game and you can walk around without seeing a thing animals will scatter before you even get a glimps of them they smell you coming from a mile away and tracking an animal for hours on end may sound tedious but it makes for a very enjoyable experience its not a game for everyone but id say atleast give the game a try
the best game in existence most exhilirating gameplay you will ever experience real life pales in comparison to this game the singleplayer offline campaign has the best story ever the graphics are amazing way aheadof its time and i love how you can eventually unlock time travel and this opens up whole new possibilities forsolving puzzles and the weapon customisation is so in depth that youcan even decide what band of screw is used and what metal is used for production and the moment when you get to ride an alpha is amazing definitly play this game and nothing else ever again
dota two is a multiplayer online battle arena game from valve dota two is the next installment from the previous game or mods dota dota two has the same gameplay as dota you pick your heroes and then battle them in one map against another player in the arena as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena you need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not dota two introduce item drops each time you finish a match online there are many items in dota two that can enhance your favourite heroes looks each item has rarity the more rare the items the more expensive it will become most items can be sold in the steam marketplace dota two has far improved graphics from the previous game heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view all heroes ability effects are also improved even the ui is better dota two has many tournaments that you can participate the biggest is the international dota two tournament most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments dota two is the best moba game yet i recommend this rating nine hundred and ten
i love this game i used to not until i bought a membership people give this a bad reveiw cause it says free to play but you need a membership people just need to stop being so cheap and buy a membership then write a reveiw cause this is a really good game
its good most of the time many buggy bits though it doesnt tell you some important thing i recommend it but dont get to exited its not the best game ive seen but its far from the worst
good game with lots of room for improvementfractured space is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter on moba style maps its fun its easy to pick up and its definitly worth it for a free game progression through the game is fairly easy and not heavily favoured towards players who pay and the devs are busy at work fixing stuff and adding new contentspros 1option of pvp pve coop or single player2 good ship balancing the devs actually listens to players and nerf the op weapons3 quite a few ppl playing find a game in under two minutes4 player base isnt five combat with three axis of movement is suprisingly fluid cons one map design have so little variety2 gameplay sometime is overreliant on accuracy this aint cs go3 ingame purchases can get you op crew and buffs not exactly p2w4 hard to turn the tide once you start losing
a very fun game absolutely worth the time youll spend playing it to top that off its free and though youll begin very slowly giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows the moment you expect a chore youre fighting the necromancers chief in brute strength from there you can do anything you so choose whether that be the plot line or discovering things you arent supposed to yet every class and race feels individual as some races change the loadout of your class it runs off the familiar stats from dnd strangth dexterity charisma constitution wisdom these stats will effect anything you do this game requires skill rather than good equipment unlike wow in that you can sidestep and teleport depending on your class to escape attacks you have to have full situational awareness though because if one enemy can sneak up on you youre gonna have a bad time you can quest with other people which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than other mmorpgs there is even a mail system and though some quests you do feel similar you wont get bored of them they never feel repetitive although they sound like it bottom line is if you have hard drive space good internet and need something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year this game is definately for you
early access reviewafter playing fortnite for around five months i have become completly bored with the game after hearing about this new game called realm royale i decided to download it i was pleasently suprised just how much of a breathe of fresh air this game is to the battle royale genre it combines elements of mobas and rpgs with battle royale and i absolutly love it
"early access reviewi say that this is a must own for horror fans why you may ask well one its freeidk if it well be later tho two its a well made game three its fun to play and thats all i can say for now want to see more play it for youre self and findout eight thousand, five hundred and ten must own"
it is what it is a gun simulator literally cool idea well designed and the graphics are a solid 8590gameplay if you want to call it that is taking a gun apart and putting it back together you can zoom in and out to get those little pieces further inside the gun level of detail while zooming is quite impressive but i feel unless you are a real serious gun enthusiast this might not be for you but for what it is it is quite impressive and well done dont take my word for it and check out my video by clicking on the link https www youtube comwatch vtg8xcwnouq
i have only played this game for a few days but it is very well done and well worth trying there are some micro transactions but that seams to be the way that these card games are going great story line so far though
first things first this is no arcade racer its a racing simulator that means its content is more geared lol towards reality racing now i dont understand why a lot of people would say any game is broken when the problem is their hardware the only reason i could see fit to complain would be if the devs make changes to the games system requirements that make it so you can no longer play the game without spending more money on new hardware this is made worse if the game is an upfront paid for game to begin withdemos are excluded if the game stops working on my system i know that as long as i have all the files downloaded no missing or corrupted files that something within my system has changed not the game lol especially if others are able to still run the game really come now why would you even fix you thoughts to blame the game if you yourself have it running on another system within your own home not to mention that your friends are not having any of your issues why are you so unlucky so the game is just bad for everyone else also im thumbing up for this game oh yeah wait pay to win its free now with eleven cars and four tracks it was like that from what i remember i just recently found this out a few days ago myself double thumbing now pay to win with a game thats free to start playing ive looked around the game and found the platinum pack deal while it could be better priced ok and doable though i havent bought it yet everything is included in the pack now your free to start playing socalled pay to two win game can be just a paid for game with full content so yes im wanting to buy the game im just saying all this imo i think that what makes a p2w game is when getting certain paid content delivers a big advantage over f2p players and when that certain paid content is unreasonably expensive but once again this all mopogood job sector three studiossimbin studios
if you enjoy magic this game is very similar with some nice twists that are fun the game is very generous about giving cards to the play more so then any other online card games ive played the tutorial is a little long and kinda boring is my only critism so stick with it and make it through the tutorial and you will most likely enjoy the game
early access reviewok so i got this game when it first came out i played a bit and then i left it but now i have come back and wow its gone from strength to strength i love playing it and i cant get enough of it and to top it all off its free two play now so people have no reasson not to try it out so if you are reading this then hit that download button now as this is one game you dont want to miss out on
its pretty decent probably the best ww2 game on steam atm well mine anyway and its not pay to win i got decent gear just grinding which i had to anyway to unlock thebetter guns and i had fun doing so and thats another thing i see alot of people complainingabout how it can be a grind fest but if there was no grind then wtf is there to do
early access reviewi played it and got stuck on the bless logo screen permanently took me almost an hour of messing around to get it working i did the ingame tutorial tried to kill some orcs and it crashed apparently this game was released in the east almost five years ago and has been tanking there due to very basic mechanics and ui being complete trash wouldrefundagain10
fun gameplay very entertaining in the beginning but very slow during the endgame unfortunately you have to rely on the chestbased lottery for late game blueprints and sadly its hard to get chests and keys without spending cash for gems
recommending this game as i am experiencing a lot of enjoyment playing it it is a free to play game which offers so much it is continually evolving and the developers update the game frequently it plays well and it has no pay to win loot boxes my personal favourite of this genre it just keeps on getting better and bigger
the game surprisingly has many layers there of course the spam when you first log in the people trying to pedal you items for real money all of which you will eventually lose which is actually one of the things i like about this game youre going to die otherwise what would be the point of those leaderboards you dont want to die too bad oryx says you have to the first time i logged on was when the entire server was being ported to oryxs castle and needless to say i died instantly i just laughed at myself a bit afterwards and stopped playing for a while but picked it back up anyways when a friend i had introduced to the game wanted me to it still held that first aspect but my friend opened my eyes to the more i will say mlg side of it for lack of a better adjective it gets very fun yet frustrating at times especially when that character you got really lucky on suddenly dies because you lagged while fighting a big boss
"early access reviewi loved playing this game recommended it to all my friends even with adding the unbalanced wweapons i stuck with it but these lame loot crates are where i draw the line youve made it impossible for people to customize the bots the way they want if they sell the blocks you give them which i dont blame them being mostly inners and random shields you lose half your meager profits from even a good match seriously sixty random blocks and a number five shield from a platinum crate level one hundred and five battle arena victory totals maybe ten million, one thousand, five hundred robits which is a tenth or less of the old rewards after conversion"
early access reviewthe art style is not really my favorite but the game has a good base and enjoyable gameplay very much like magic the gathering mixed with hearthstone my biggest complaint would be the lack of ramp cards and the fact you cannot have less than thirteen power cards in your decks overrall super fun hope it gains popularity
edit4242018 i hear they are getting rid of the pay to winplay but until i see it gone my review will stay if it goes back to the old robocraft it will change i got this game when it first came out and i thought it was good for a couple updates then it went down hill fast i quit playing this for one twelve years due to the nonhelpfulgame inproving updates i tried it again today may twentythree two thousand and fifteen found out it got worse it went from a free to playsomewhat equal with the option to play to might as well pay to today where the only way i can see how you can really improve anymore is payto get any good wepons you have to pay everything is overhauled the currency the object naming systemits now remenicent of steiger tractor co only more confusing and nowgood or bad the announcers sound almost exactly like tf2 dont drag them into this mess and run from this game in all if you could get a version from one year ago get it this version no edit i do see steam does say this game is mostly negative with in the last thirty days no surprise there im surprised there isnt a overall negative rating

early access review bad game game is one hundred pay to win tanks are op teams are always going to be unbalanced runs the only defence to tanks to rocket launchers but to be able to afford one would be easily thirty hours of grinding for money leaving you with guns you have to repair your attachments for some stupid reason i already paid a ton of money to buy a gun and now i have to ing maintain them three hundred and ten would not redownload ok graphics terrible spawns
overall impressionsive been told that this game is great from launch and time and time again from posthype patches between getting blasted from a line of fire to heal another soldier in battle and getting spawnkilled from a sunderer to jump into battles my poor experience from the game has yet to mature into something great i will admit planetside two has a lot of content to cover in the first couple of hours theres just so much to learn on top of the fact that everyone seems to know what theyre doing but as for scrawny me i didnt know about the training area until four hours in and i clearly dont quite recall on the amount of depth the game had to offer between character weapon and vehicle customization from the trailers not only do you as a character get to customize the kinds of weapons you would like in terms of a playstyle but each of these loadouts contain a perk that you can choose to addon along with other smaller addons onto your vehicle in addition the weapons you equip and their inner machinations are something you can choose to change these changes arent for nought of course they do in fact change the game that said if youre a player who wants to jump in and get a fun engagement within the span of fifteen minutes like most korean f2p shooters this is not for you spawn times feel slow and deliberate even if it is only fifteen seconds instant action consistently warps you into different locations and dont even get me started ont travelling between each zone when stalemates hit on a heavy day these battles last longer than a typical infantryonly match in battlefield three you have to do your research on the game as i mentioned earlier i didnt play very well im certain that is a primary result of it if you want to play well in the game theres certainly the whole aimng and shooting aspect of it but theres a lot more than just that and many of the players account for this whilst being in the battle all of that in mind if you know you want to put a lot of time into not being productive this is the game for you

early access reviewthe teir system was changed now even in the lowest tier you get destroyed by way to strong way to expensive weapons saving to get them is basically not possable without a ton of farming not fun at all anymore
to begin with youll be hooked i was from july last year to jan this year then you realise your still farming the same enemys in the endgame as the ones at day one and their is no real point to it the enemys look different but attack the same theirs about five different types just with tons of remodeledreskinned versions on a more positive note the general gameplay although repetative and building component is nice and the classes are awesome they add tons of variation to the game although having to farm to get them all wasnt good the cummunity is friendly and trove is really easy to mod i modded the game when i tired of playing it the amount of rng in the game ruins it though a ton of farming needed to progress in the game not much variation in enemy functionality basically point and shoot or point and slash back in july i would have recommended this but then trion noticed they hadnt screwed the trove playerbase over yet i wouldnt recommend getting this its a waste of time
early access reviewive played this game for ninetyseven hours as a paladin the class that has the lowest dps which sucks when trying to level can you say boring ive clubbed everyone to death for four hundred and fifteen levels there is a story to the game but after level twentyfive you enter into the pvp zones that is where toons much higher than you dwell and try to kill you the moment you step up to a quest giver to say i have no clue what the story is at this point is an understatement what is it like to level a paladin at level forty one well ive killed three thousands mobs and performed twentyfive questions im only half way to level 42i am so bored of this game the only way ill keep playing is if the devs make me fortyfifth level cus if level fortyone is any indication ill have to kill another seventeen thousand mobs and perform one hundred and ninety quests to hit forty five just not worth it you want to know what is in and not in the game read the six thousand reviews want a fun game this one is not it players are leaving this game
i played combat arms since two thousand and eight since i started playing heroes generals i havent even logged on to ca this game is the best war game ive ever played i love this game if youve never played this game you need to check it out you will love it my hat goes off to the guys that make this possible the detail is awesome i wish i could play this game two hundred and forty seven but i have to work during the week thats how much i love this game look how many hours ive racked up and so fast ive only been playing this game a few months play heroes generals youll be glad you did look on youtube for videos that will teach you about the game also check the forums there is also a channel on team speak three there you can join a clan and get to know some people who have played the game a long time and know the ins and outs of the game you will learn a lot from these guys i hope this review will help have a good one
omg my waifu is in this game anime5evar loolloollo share two facebook about elsword success pay two win goodness classic at its maxx other words i cant stand anime nor this game ech too kawaii
early access reviewgame felt alittle slow at the begining tbh this will be a short review content missing not enough classes yes its early access but a lot feels wrong simpley didnt live up to the expections or felt like it was a good enough game graphics felt like they were from an older verison of ffxiv
really good game combines tactics with shooting and cooperating with your teammates buy it if you want to spend time flying around and shooting or if you have friends to make a squad and play together the second one feels amazing
the elder scrolls legends is a game based on the universe of the famous saga the elder scrolls after playing more than five hundred hours game mostly on android i can say that it is a wonderful game with multiple game modes history mindbusting ranked arena casual has a new attractive interface good dynamics of games different types of decks and creating them from a fun to the most strategic the community is very close you can advance in various ways to get cards and decks you can farming gold or buy it with real money at no time the game forces you to spend it is up to you how to play and get the items
battlefield four conquest very large scale maps never ending combat kinda slightly p2w but you can mostly avoid paying if you are skilled enough or if you are playing with a group of friends try it and dont rage quit when you get killed for the one hundredth time in a row this game is not easy watch some guides online
very poor driving experience the game is hd but the graphics dont excel the menu is very hard and mazed up as an actual ingame footage on every challange you are allowed to controll your car after three seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose controll of your car immediatelly no to mention that everytime you are forced to start the game on a curve there are three dificulties that you can chose before you enter a race once you are in it you cannot adjust them novice the one that the ai breaks like your grandmanormal the decent way to play this gameaaand advanced unplayable from keyboard few tracks few cars you are forced to play a specific car on a specific race the game looks ok from the outside but its not worthing the time waiting to install cheerspredatorx
this game is pretty good its basically all those popular voxel games put together to make a good game overview so when you first launch up the game you make your account which is pretty easy so i dont mind that and then you make your character the character creation is nice with a couple hair styles and lots of colors to choose for anything really so after creating your character you get put into your own world this is basically the tutorial section of the game this little cube named qb is basically your navi h e y l i s t e n theyll help you along in all your adventures after you get through the tutorial section of the game you can start doing stuff by your own there isnt really an end to the game unless you count the end as collecting all items which is yeah you know the gameplay is really fun too the combat feels balanced and the building is pretty polished for the time its been out this game is really fun especially if you have friends who play too you can make worlds together and stuff tldr creativerse is a voxel game which is very polished and really fun
early access reviewbeautiful game with much thought put into it ten outta ten if you ask me if terraria was 3d and had children with minecraft this would be it pros unique gameplayinteresting craftingcons very very small amount of oresyou will not get out of this game for approximately twenty h cause it took me that much to get best armor
this game is really an underrated work of greatness the space graphics are completely out of this world tee hee the gameplay is smooth and requires teamwork to really win the game but doest deter solo players from enjoying the arena style combat on their own the developers continuously update this game with ships skins and balancing frequently you wont regret trying this out hell drag a friend with you for two times the fun and eight times the rage when he doesnt pick a support ship jake we already have three attackers and im already tanking go support one hundred and seventeen would dock with other dudes in space again
this game was nothing like i thought it was gonna be i thought this game was gonna at least feel a little bit realistic this game just feels awful to play the character movements are clunky and the shooting is awful any character can shoot pretty much anywhere and the controls are horrible i can literally shoot 3s with big centers
jogo massa estrategico e muito empolgante apesar de ser um game de cartas conta uma história bem diferente dos elder scrolls antecessores o ponto mais positivo é que foi muito bem dublado em português brazuka
garbage wrapped in pretty colors the game to satify gamers who like to grind for goods but not really do anything but waste time its beta so be ready for false representation of awards and nonstop ingame popups selling rubies oh joy
god damn have the mighty have fallen i had started this game around december of two thousand and fourteen and it seemed interesting the previous year came and gone without much issues with the updates but then this year rolled around and it looks like the game is under new manegement i did not mind the removal of tech points nor the addition of new weapons but the straw that broke the camels back is one important thing nano disruptors loss of damage output to enemies and therefore its fall to complete uselessness if you can heal yourself by just waiting why have someone on your team with just nano disruptors when you can just hide somewhere and regenerate the addition of lockon weapons seemed like a good idea on paper but it makes taking them on a nightmare when you consider that the new loot system has a good probability to reward these weapons you should never ever ever have loot drops be the sole way to earn curancy and items and more importantly never have the rng be too damn broad with the drops as another reviewer has pointed out it does not matter if you bought crates odds are that all the drops will be comon or uncomon ninety of the time i had to deal with cryptarch rahool in destiny year one and he was more fair with his drops even before bungie fixed his rolls with engrams than with this new bs loot system and what the hell is up with the locked drops behind slots deal we got them out of those crates give them to us dont you dare shove a cupcake in our face and then take it away because we dont have the neccecary requirements considering these items are going to be hard as hell to get now with the new currency situation with the drop system in place you have to break down items just so then you can make new ones overall great ing job with screwing over year long fans who enjoyed the game and great job ing over people who would gladly give you money with this backwater money gouging system you suck because you made a once good game suck thank god for jim sterling update ten wow you guys really ed it up i came back hoping that the game might just might have changed for the better but no it got worse first of all i see the loot box system hasnt changed didnt even bother giving those who suffered through the last year of this show a day of prenium just to earn all of the rewards no and while i will admit giving players almost an unlimited size just that in order to play pvp it has to be under two thousands cpu the fact that getting blocks to build your bot with is still a chore makes it underwhelming and is it just me or is the weight of your bot is put on the back left as opposed to the center where it should be this cant be a counter to drones as most bots are supposed to built from the center outwards it would make no sense to change that also i miss the the singleplayer mode where you could kill bots and get rewarded for it what think that people were abusing it its actually laughable on how at release it has less players then when it went to alpha then again it has been a year and a half since i wrote this review and youve done buggered it up some more clearly yall are deaf to your audience and you should be ashamed for it
early access reviewif you think fortnite is bad because of the building then this is for you its still in early alpha but its improving alot so give it a goo its only 3p but as a person loving 1p in pubgarma three its not that bad to play it in 3p unlike fortnite
at first the game will see like fun but then you realize the community seems to be non existen all armour looks the same and it feels like a bare bones theme park which it isat least the character creator is nice but i hate the over detailed armor and weapons that they give us
edit i have tried getting into it again and i still see the problems listed here it is also a fact that i hate f2p games for it is often it is p2w dont let steams game time fool yall ive played this game since nov two thousand and thirteen daily i got the game directly off soes page when i first tried it i felt confused in a good way and it was fun 100s of people on foot in tanks in transport trucks called sunderers and in fighters then after twenty three months i felt like i was repeating yesterday over and over the first impressions the game left on me vanished i decided to stay however seeing i invested time and money but then a few months later i noticed a decline in player activity something i honestly expected it dropped to mere a continent having fewer them fifty people on it at that point i felt like people left because of lack of content lack of instructions or lack of movitation i then decided to quit my membership and leave the game all together now onto the pros and the cons pros a lot of weapons and tools to use a lot of so called outfits that are player groups a good mix of land and air vehicles to pilot big battlegrounds to exchange fire servers for different time zones cons cosmetics and membership are overpriced weapons with ingame currency are overpriced requires a highgrade pc to run at decent settings poor tuturial level poor ingame mic chat possible unexpected game crashes newer players can mess up a base capturedefensethats all i was able to think of this game isnt good i give it a four hundred and ten
this is my first ever steam review and its for one of the best games ever ive had tried getting into other moba games but simply coudnt i gave smite a chance because of the unique gods theme and the playing camera angle and im glad i did the game environment is absolutely chilling and addicting all those gods and the powers make you wanna play it two hundred and forty seven definately recommeded
early access reviewthe draws in this game are just insane almost every game you either draw all power cards or the opponent has answers for everything you play i understand decks are supposed to be able to control the board but when you draw seven power cards in a row while the opponents are at five hp and end up losing the game because they can kill your units the rest of the game it just takes away every bit of fun or interest
since they never send you the registration email you can never play and there is no way to ask it to resend the registration email so dont wast your hard drive space on this dud
early access reviewnot really sure what happened to this game i started playing about a little over a year ago and everything made sense the economy the way the bots where divided into tiers the construction process was great one of my favorite aspects of the game was trying to find more effective ways to build robots i just tried to play it and everything has completely changed there is no more stratification in the armor its unclear to me at least how the matchmaking system works the whole tech tree seems to have dissappeared the pilot seat is gone whats the point in thinking about where your blocks go if there is nothing vulnerable its still fun to drive around and blow up other peoples bots but the game seriously lacks the elements that got me really into it in the first place
early access reviewhorrendous dont bother thirty four releases and they didnt learn jack from their previous failure stay away from this game its not worth it youre in for a very big fat disappointment if you buy this game
its like eating a juicy dirty burger except better therefore i recommend this game period oh plus solo arena and upcoming in game tournaments you dont get that in burgers very often on a serious note your hearthstone playing skills brain data can be transfered over to this game nice of the developers to incorporate that feature1010update 10th july seventeen after the release of heroes of skyrim and thirty hours into the game been playing a lot of solo arena and some ranked matches i have already started to lose interest in the game and getting bored more often it just dosent have that fun factor that i get with hearthstone with hearthstone i get plenty of good laughs which makes it a happy game where as legends just feels dark and somewhat sad i tried to like this game hopefully leaving hearthstone behind after three years but it just dosent quite make the cut dont get me wrong its a decent game i recommend i enjoyed the first few hours due to the exitement of a new card game but its just not appealing enough for a hearthstone veteran like me not that juicy dirty burger i thought it would be
dont let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race it is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored now thats not to say that this game doesnt have flaws after all what games these days dont have a flaw here and there the only big flaw for me is that the ai has vastly superiour grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the devs are working on fixing that issue right now online races in this game are a real blast in get real mode but first i beg you to log practice time in this mode based on the multiplayer races i have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life now the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so get real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definately the best mode another thing the devs might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want in short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try i mean its free so youve got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you dont like the game but wouldnt you have burned that time gaming anyway
i dont usually write reveiws for games but felt i had to with planetside two im not particularily good at the game nor do i have an outfit clan to play with which i hear improves the enjoyment of the game however ive gotten tons of hours of enjoyment from this game nonetheless the largest things that causes me to keep this game in high regard are one the ability to feel like youre contributing reagardless of how skilled you are of course if you are very skilled and have a large squad to coordinate with youll have a large impact however even alone and even if you arent getting kills healing others repairing vehicles spotting enemys from afar giving ammo contributing to mass advances etc all help your teammates and dont require a large amount of skill2 the incredible amount of customization and unlocks the amount of things to unlock and advancement is so immense that you will always have something to strive for and gives a constant sense of purpose and achievement3 the amazing feel of mass warfare large zerg swarms of infantry followed by huge player tank conveys and large air battles raging overhead is just extremely fun and just being there as part of it all on foot in a vehicle or in air is just plain awesome and very few if any games offer this experience on this scale4 its completely free ive paid about only five for a little bit of station cash and the only reason i paid that was to support the game you can easily get by without paying a dime and i did until i felt like a criminal getting so much enjoyment without paying anything there have been complaints of paytowin and tediousness if you dont pay and while there is some of this i dont think its completely valid but judge for yourself as its completely free theres so much value and so little cost as in zero that its a no brainer to at least try the game out
bad graphics and its not really that fun when there are just a few ppl going around trying to kill you its just not that fun when you lose everything cuz someone snuck up and shot you why do i want to grind for items i just had just to lose them again
going to change my review to positive i love the graphics they are simply the best in the industry this game take skill i mean that not that i have that much but im practicing and getting better a little more and more everyday also i think i like the buy as you need model this way you dont get a bunch of stuff you dont need or want this applies to cars tracks and liveries seting up a controller takes time and patience this is definately a game for mature individuals not that i am very mature this game is a good teacher also what can i say lola big thank you for the devolopersi get itpeter
life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields springing up and appealing you into some fresh conflict and only a few surely understood redirections make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release whats more a short time later theres team fortress two released in two thousand and seven this classbased commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering since gamespots one of a kind tf2 review the entertainment has benefitted from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted toplay plan of activity the middle action pits two gatherings of players against each other in a battle to get centers move a truck or take an organizer case the objective is always uncommonly clear its the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting the convenient scout the assailant generous the tireless pro the conspiring specialist the irritating sharpshooter the tricky see the feisty pyro the shaky trooper and the fundamentally morerisky demoman all have exceptional weapons attributes and limits that supplement each other and strife in bundle ways encounters can vary comprehensively depending upon the match sort and the beautifiers of each gathering and this strangeness is dire to tf2s longstanding solicitation when you leave the door as a mindboggling with a specialist near to youre a forcing unfriendly constrain yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pyro it can all come unwound in a matter of seconds master marksmen can cover expected foe ways however rocketricocheting warriors have an ability for finding elective courses and raining dangerous going from above you may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights just to be lurched by a baseball and beat the life out of as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit packaging of your cheerful killer its hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavorable end besides engaging jokes insane outfits and sensational host build up this sprightly tone clearly this inside component has endured for by far most of tf2s future so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches youll find things are to a great degree surely understood taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information and acing pushed frameworks doesnt just make you deadlier it gives you more options for how to approach fight keeping your choices open is still gainful too in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a disastrously imbalanced squad it is team fortress taking all things into account regardless however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection there have been some noticeable changes consistently and moreover ordinary imbuements of new weapons and things of the few things available in the online store some can be opened through play while others must be acquired with genuine money from little knickknacks that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds theres a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainments starting now saucy toon snappy you can buy tops shirts shoes and other remedial gear to spruce up like a character from adult swim or wear spooky incidental garments that you can wear just in the midst of halloween or a full moon notwithstanding the likelihood that you dont support spending for any of this stuff its diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavor to light your adversaries on fire the best difference from the redirections beginnings comes in the accommodating mode mann versus machine in it you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of robotized incarnations of tf2s classes from passing on a bomb to your base the money you pick up from pulverizing robots can be spent on midorganize climbs to your qualities and weaponry which can be essential to accomplishment for sure even on the most easy level the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering this is a mode where absolutely masterminded weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the differentiation among succeeding and attempting endeavor afresh you can play this mode to no end yet you wont be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a tour of duty ticket notwithstanding the way that it doesnt have the energized oddity of centered play the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through however contention is the honest to goodness draw and the team fortress two gathering can completely be engaged on a couple of servers you might be scolded for unwitting cracks of respectability while on others you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and ubercharges you can even demand help on particular servers and be corresponded with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk the society around tf2 is a charming one not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons things and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience it feels like a gathering of managers without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter yet heres team fortress two still overflowing after seven years in the business every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail classbased shooter competition the way tf2 does the experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless so however your permitted toplay choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years there are few that do it furthermore team fortress 2all reviews are retrieved from the internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time in my religion this is known as arttm but you can call it threewording
love this sim i know some people say it needs and engine update for better tire modeling and overall performance but the game is very palyable for preactice and online racing the force feedback settings are great you can get your wheel dailed in pretty good give it a try and you will love it cant wait for gtr3 update
i have been playing this game since beta and i really do love it i am a fan of these games and a massive elder scrolls fan so i would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of either and more so to those a fan of both
early access reviewi love this game iâ m still learning some of the more interesting combos and deck styles after tons of time in the game i can play on my phone with my card collection and decks so time spend gaining cards from wins feels good and not wasted you get complicated game play and strategies like mtg but with a smooth and polished client like hearthstone if you enjoy hearthstone or mtg you will enjoy this
great and charming graphics very polished gameplay charming characters and npc many contents and many things to do you will not be bored for a long time many strategies and lot of possibilities lots of customization for your character cities shop buildings items very addictive at least for the first four hundred and twenty hours make you cannot stop playing after few hours playing the game will forced you to spend real money or you wont have any progress for a very long periods of time for example level one you need one thousands gold to level up level two need five thousands gold level three need ten thousand gold then suddenly level four need two hundred thousand gold to level up while the pace of the gems spending is stable 100200300400etc but even after this time the game is still fun enough especially if you know the trick to gain fast money you need to pay lots of gold to raise level cap of every characters in the game including heroes and workers your heroess weapons can break when you reach a certain level weapons will break here and there even the break percentages are very small you will need gems to repair it your shop cannot do anything or else you must scrap it the microtransaction will get worse the longer you play the game at least the first few hours is really really fun and if you know the trick and patient enough you wont need to spend any money the gems are very expensive the cheapest one has the price of a good indie game and the good ones have the price of a aaa game
i really enjoyed this game for its ability to get anything in the game minus a few things with either hard work or money however it is now steering very far into the p2p territory and it makes me sad
fun game for the first while but it lacks more abilities and over all variety for the most part its just clearing out dungeons forever until youre bored of doing so in short the game is good if youre looking for a small break from whatever games you normally play since the game is free i do suggest getting it and playing it for a while
wow this game has made dayz look amazing there is no survival aspect at all and there are too many guns so its basically just a deathmatch thats it nothing more nothing less the only saving grace for this deathmatch is i guess it performs well unlike most of these zombie open world things get 60fps on ultra with a r9 three hundred and ninety and a i5 i guess if your just looking for a one hundred player open world deathmatch with zombies chucked in then fill ya boots but if your loooking for a survival game then look else where maby h1z1 or dayz but to be fair this is a genre of game that is struggling to be done well
while i do love this game there is a few problems with it pros fast and fun action especially with teammatesthe graphics while not groundbreaking is pleasing to look atevery character is fun to play as and brings something different to the table with ara and rena being my favoratesthere are a lot of good tracks in the game cons the game will often encourage you to spend some real money on the game things like costumes extended skill slots pets etcgame can get grindheavy later on not like maplestory grindheavy but in the very later dungeons youll need to do a few dungeon runs before you can move on to the next mission overall i do like this game but i can say the microtransactions can be a turnoff for some if you are interested in trying it play the game for a few hours maybe go to lv30 or something and then deside if its worth investing a few bucksupdate okay taking a look at the prices and i can say that some of these are insane i think spending around twenty five for a single costume set is a bit much then again look at what were paying unusuals
the basic idea of this game is great the graphics are good the only major problem is that this isnt hunting i dot know anyone who goes out with a gps helper to trackstalk thier own kill this game makes you depend on gadgets rather than any sort of skill the pay system isnt worth it i will be uninstalling in just a few
this game at first made me upset i saw the free two play label and though this will be awesome i will admit my thoughts as of first were bad i did not like i had only one gun that could only kill one of the two species i was allowed to hunt and the fact that only one map really allowed me to play i will be frank the free two play portion is more of a demo really but youll notice i have put in lots of hours i did indeed pay for the three month subscription and indeed bought several guns and sights for them this game will cost about four thousand and fifty dollars to get up and active with the full range of everything to enjoy i will say though i am very happy with the quality of the game versus this cost i very much enjoy this game and have found it both a rush and a calm pleasant experience i will not forget that moment where i dropped a buck with a muzzleloader for the first time or the time i killed a charging moose with a ww2 german k98 this game will cost you to enjoy it fully but i do recommend it and i am very pleased i consider it money well spent it is a very detailed fun enjoyable hunting game and with my physical cd collection of hunting games rate this as the best910 is my score only because sometimes the rendering gets finnicky ninety nine of the time works well and plays amazingly looks beautiful and is the best hunting game ive played
straight paygrind to win what kind of competitive game allows your opponent to have objectively stronger towers than you why even have the match when theres a chance it just comes down to some guy having grinded more than you
early access reviewheroes and generals is a ww2 based shooter that uses a more realistic combat system in this aspect of the game it is fun however the game quickly lost my intrest i am a vertan fps player and i have decent aim i have many hours logged in various games and the biggest issue i have with this game is that it does not reward players well for there achivments you make a set amount of money per hour when you rank up u gain more money per hour but it is not much form eight thousands to eighteen thousand five hundred or so the issue i have with this is the player who made four hundred xp in a ten min match will get the same reward as the player who made twenty the cost of weapons is way to high for the amount you have to play to get them verdict if you are bad at fps games this game if for you but if you are good you will strugle with getting money and probably get frustrated fast
early access reviewmost of the negative reviews are from players who spent less than ten hours playing the game while half of those played less than five hours of the game ive seen some negative reviews where the person played less that twenty minutes seriously its a fun game with a decent storyline the combat has been better than i expected after watching reviews on youtube the game does have issues for sure such as getting stuck on the bless title screen and frequent disconnects the frame rate does drop quite a bit too these are also known issues that neowiz has said theyre working on fixing neowiz has been working on fixing the issues that keep poping up all through the early access despite all the hiccups in the game i am having fun got my paladin to lvl forty four a lvl twentyfive ranger and a guardian to lvl forty two i hope to see more people jumping into the game the bless splash screen seems to be fixed for me ive been able to log right into the game i havent been disconnecting either so that also seems to be fixed also neowiz has given out twentyfour hundreds free lumenlumia for all of the trouble weve experienced this weekend and stuck with the game d6122018 still playing the game and haing fun have a nice group of players i met in the game really good and helpful community in the game too i play on the hieron side and the players are not toxic which is really nice all of the problems from the two day headstart have been fixed any time an issue comes up neowiz s quick to take care of them i feel that youtubers have been too harsh on the game and those reviews are scaring away people that have been on the fence about trying the game
early access reviewday one i invited my friends to join this game kill the crying creatures day two my friends have the final weapon already oo one thousand and ten game youll see your mom trolling you
note while my time played metric is really low on steam ive been playing this game since the release of open beta last year and have played at high ranks for the majority of that time this is an excellent card game its my favorite card game on the market because it combines excellent card design with board mechanics that facilitate multiple lines of play on each turn if you want a card game that strongly rewards critical thinking but is easy to pick up and understand i encourage you to give this one a try if you arent a competitive player then this game is still a blast due to it having the most rubust single player modes of any digital card game over the last few months ive alternated between playing competitively on the ladder and playing the solo content and theyve both been great fun
note some of this is simply opinion because i enjoy the httyd franchise pros reasons why i think its great hours of entertainment its flipping free so try it over thirty unique dragons many cool quests and maps fun minigames devs update for new amazing dragonsexpansions every now and then cons yeah this game does have some problems i will admit the membership thing is dumb once you do all the quests not as fun some terrain glitches ex flying through groundoverall i think its a game that may not be for all but anyone who sees it should most certainly try it
early access reviewpeople have been trying to butcher this release because it didnt have the best first day the core mechanics of this game is great sure they have a lot to iron out but theyre fixing things daily already new content launched and there is no pay to win element whatsoever bless brought me back to mmos and ill be staying for a while
early access reviewif you want a hard everytime you carry your friend abel to a 3k rating clutching every 1v2 so sexy it makes your neighbors mums storm like h katrina then download this game and queue with your circus n of a m8
early access reviewthis game i highly recomend new players to mmos to get i am a new player myself and it has taught me the basics of how to play games such as wow it is a very fun game but it does take a while to level up once you get to the higher levels which does require alot of farming but i guess thats how the developers get people to have more hours on the game even though most people ditch games that make you farm enemies just to level up once
dear gabe i am still writing to you but you aint calling i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottomi sent two letters back in autumn you must nota got emthere probably was a problem at the post office or something
balanced cant say that about lol easy to get characters cant say that about lol variety cant say that about lol all attacks you have to aim cant say that about lol easy controls cant say that about lol you get the idea if you still like lol at least try this for two hours if you still dont like this thats fine to each their own
early access reviewupon asking about sevral things that were in game the dev was completly rude and disrespectfull upon asking why the guardian items were under powered they said it would be a pay to win game and when mentioning why a gray rarity item can trump said guardian items easily they said color border on items hold no meaning for rarity so whats the point of making them with a rarity this game may be cross platform but its directed at mobile gaming they should of stuck to 2d games like there known for and not of made this garbage
tf2 meet its match in the meet your match update and when i mean meet its match i meant meet its end tf2 is dead rip oct nine 2007july seven twenty sixteens you were real good son maybe even the best
early access reviewanother battle royale game joins the market but i like this why no building good touch with melee weapons vs guns graphics are cartoonish ala fortnite if you are unfortunate like me to be cursed with being left handed and use the keypad some of the bindings do not work yes i am one of those weird ones with the mouse on the left side
early access reviewi put down some corruption it began eating my world similar to terraria if this game had boss fights and better mobs it would be a pretty complete game pigs climbed in my windows because i didnt have glass they killed me i was sad fifty five would totally leave my windows open again
product received for freeубоожество disgusting отвратительноif you ever want to play a game where ninety nine of hits on you will be one shot kill then this pile of overwhelmingly disgusting crap is for you if you ever want the play a game where you have a minimap that gives you absolutely no information this is for you if you ever want to play a pathetic excuse of a game where instead of a tank you recieve a vehicle with no wheels and made of cardboard but still feels like you driving something that waights over three hundred tonns this ing is for you i spent on this pile of crap just around five or six and i regret every ing pennythis piece of shoud never be on steam in the first place gaijin burn in hell you ing awfulif you want a game with tank battles involved go world of tanks go armored warfare go anything but this so called game it brought me nothing but regret and bad feelings nothing
never played wow but i assume this is as close as you could get for free awesome game with tons of features and events youll never run out of things to do you do have to pay actual money to get any of the cool stuff though
early access reviewwent through one hundred rooms so far filled one hundred buckets with sweat and changed one hundred pairs of underwear so far the game is brilliant it is disturbing and scary but not in that classic violent and gory way i recommend to anyone who wants a bit of cute harmless scare
amazing back then its youll die from lag servers are crap greed community no teamwork classes that tank do more damage than offensives unless your running maxed endgame untiered soulbounds soulbounds no longer tradable crappy droprates and more farm than a korean mmorpg take it from a two year veteran that has the star right below highest tier game wont get fixed lol has a better community and worst of all kabam just farms the money off it
early access reviewa crossplatform mmo from a company that has only been getting better and better at making games its a great game sofar and it will get even better as time passes i highly recommend this game
it has the same problem as any other card game like this same duel you lost in two turns next time you win in two turns one hundred random no skill required takes all the fun out of making your own deck you can just spam monsters and win with no effortespecially since you got so low lifepoints4000 is not enough for anything other than a rushing offensive playstyleand then there all these unskippable shiny transitions ugh wastin your time
this game used to be good until the started making pvp specific classes classes way better than others and pay to look good and even pay to win i also didnt like the customer service sort of thing they have i was hacked a while back and they told me i gave my password away their reasoning for that is they logged in first then they changed the password i lost over two hundred because of that dont pay a damn thing just in case that happens to you other than that good play style
why increase the price in chinese area it was at good price people in china were willing pay that much money to get more fun in this wonderful game however that bargain is gone sad now the price is ridiculos i love this game i payed for lots of aircrafts but no morejust buy a dlc
dont be fooled by sixtyeight hours my main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay this game offers so much but its rather difficult to get into while being incredibly easy to get in to starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one at first glance its a fun game but nothing youd spent much time on now if you look past that there is actually so much the leveling system isnt what determines a character maxed stats are in game potions are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy along with gear and other items these potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons to problem is getting this far takes practice detrmination and grit death is inevitable dont let it set you back learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful even the most powerful characters who have all eight stats maxed are prone to quick deaths the game in unforgiving and requires skill but offers much in return for those who deliver
this game is so unbalanced it hurts the weapons are a massive grind to obtain and the classes are completly overpriced finding a server to play takes twenty five minutes and i often find myself joining a server that is already midend game
team fortress two is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands maybe millions of players on right now playing it is really fun and seven different classes to keep you ocuppied there is scout class fast and can double jump has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost two shots there is a soldier class has a rpg very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances there is a pyro class has a flamethrower good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes spies snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup there is a heavy good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best has a big gun and loves it like his own son there is a demoman has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies the engineer can make teleporters entrance and exit point a dispencer heals him and friends and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances all the things can be upgraded to level three which is the last and best levels there is a spy has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback the spy can sap the engineers teleporters both dispencer and the sentry the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends the medic is very important in helping the offensive time if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets two health back for every hit the medic gets two hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time and finally the sniper the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time he a submachine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in two hits other classes three to five hits at least thats all the classes ive covered the maps are amazing and highly detailed and new maps coming in from the community every month new guns being made skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind new abilities for classes and more to come stuff to buy at the tf2 store man co is what its called i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad go to the store and buy it dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time ok thats covers tf2 hope u like my review and please rate it i give team fortress two nine hundred and ten from arcade
this is the best racing simulation game ive ever played its free to play and the initial package is good the dlc is great too every serious simracer should try it since it is free what have you got to lose
this game was pretty good i enjoyed going around and fighting the monsters and doing certain quests and learning about the mechanics of the game i also like the fact there s different classes you can be and you can have multiple of them at the same time the game does get a little repetitive though at least in my experience i will admit i don t play as much so i can t judge it completely i am sure there s more to the game then what i saw this game overall was pretty good though
"do you feel like playing a game that doesnt involve micro transactions that give people the edge over you do you feel like fighting in a fair fight that isnt one sided every day do you feel like taking off in your very own spaceship and fighting the enemy and do you feel like getting to know a certain set of weapons without fearing they will get nerfed any day well what the are you still doing here deciding wether or not to get this game planetside two is one hundred pay to win the teams are not evenly matched and the developers do nothing about it the spawns are not safe from team killing and blowing up your brand spanking new space ship that you can only spawn in every one thousand and twenty mins thats if you have the resources to spawn one the weapons are constantly nerfed and changed making the game harder and harder to play let alone have any sort of fun the competition is gone out of the game and for your own sake just look past this game and get star citizen or even a game that is 1000x better than this snake for the nokia three thousand, three hundred and ten"
one started to play game 2got in server for beginners got killed in two min from spawn 3made a new character four joined another server for beginners five got killed again in less than two min
the actual racing experience is really really well done in this game but ludicrously expensive dlcpass on it until the devs cure their insanity and greed and actually prtice the game contents fairly
pretty simple but really fun its an mmorpg bullet hell shooter if you can get past the graphics i can but i know yall youngsters only want hd graphics and crap then its worth playing especially for free
early access reviewwhere to start this game was actually the one battle royal that hooked me from the start i was loving it everything about it the classes were cool the forgeing part was epic and the fact that mounts would remove the feeling of yet another running simulatorgame was amazing very fast paced since camping was not an option if you wanted to have a fair chance in the end updates started dropping and the game become more and more casualfriendly legendary drops from chests and removal of chicken trophies which was fine but still not as satisfying as the first few patches doomsday for this game hit when they decided to remove the classes all along not only did they remove the classes but they remove one of the skill slots along with all epic and legendary weapons this would be fine if you atleast could have the abbility too craft weapons above uncommontier i reccomended this for a group of friends and they all loved it today no i would not reccomend it
early access reviewthis game is quite fun and is a very nice little space game so if your interested in space combat go right ahead and buy this game there are a few small problems for example it takes forever to actually get into a server also there is not a huge variation in the ships you can get but all in all this appears to be a great start to an amazing looking game
its a good game been playing since s2 and im still addicted to the game the only problem i have with the game as if right now is that alot and i mean alot of good skins are locked within rng chests for example pay four hundred gems to get one of these exclusive skins open up the chest get a avatar or ward skin
used to be a good game a few months ago i even bought in game currency but now its just pay to play because they raised the price on everything that you could buy without actual money devs got greedy and made the game crap
early access reviewi would recommend this game if you enjoy mmo rpgs ive played since the tech demo and enjoyed it from the beginning that being said this game still has it cons pros fun game great atmospherenice communityreally cool weapons and armorcombat systemcons lots of bugs to be fair it is just a betatakes hours of farming just to craft an item which takes two days to craftthis game will destroy your wallet if youre impatientserver crashessorry this review isnt very long to be fair the game isnt fully done yet so there is still more to come i would rate this game nine hundred and ten
seriously its good when you can play the game but i have never experienced a game this hard to start i have been trying to get back on this for hours now my problems wont even show up on google searches i did everything i could uninstalling properly is one of them its the worst honestly
this game is absolutly awesome every class has its unique skills and every single one of them is greatgraphics are not bad and never get boringthis game may look hard at the first time but when you reach twenty hours of playing then you cant stop playing and you want to play more and more but the best part is gameplay controls are very smooth after two hours of playing you can find the class that is made for you i played a lot multiplayer games but from my opinion this game is the best multiplayer game ever made 1010thank you valve
i have been playing this game for over a year and its one of the better idle games out there i love how you can pick your team and adjust them to get max damage against the enemeies theres nothing better than realizing one small adjustment will get you tearing up the ranks
after a lots of hours and efforts you give to this game to earn high mmr with a seasonal jackass of ten games with quitters and feeders one will say you are the idiot off i can send all the replays to your dumb and see for yourself how the is this mmr so trash you will lose all that mmr just because you team up with dog of dota no wonder they say this game is dying how the this game once so very fun and good now become a disaster thanks to this stupid patch buffs and t matchmaking
fun and mind games nine out of 10this is a fun game if you like card games like pokemon or yugioh its free wich is a and it has allot of callbacks to skyrim and oblivion its balenced on all teams but it dose have two bugs that have annoyed me but havent overshadowed the game not counting the magic and giving you youre tern but not giving you magic or a card for your tern it will take up hours of your life if you love card games you always have to think about what the other player has in hisher deckhand and thats what makes it hard but really fun to the people who made this game thank you
so i see the release date is fourteen oct two thousand and fifteen that seems a long time to be suffering from basic bugslack of simple features game loads up in tiny window that cant be changed until you start the game and are immediately being attacked apparently f makes the game change to fullscreen but we are supposed to smell that information or sense it through the force once i click the gear for the options menu or anything that pops up a new menu it pops up but cant get rid of it escape doesnt do anything clicking the close button does nothing is the mouse click even activating where my pointer is no visual feedback there the game is essentially frozen as i cant get back to playing whats going on here how ironic that they sell starter packs when their game cant even start properly perhaps i am the one who is wrong i must have downloaded something different maybe maybe im really in a mental institute somewhere locked away inside a padded room experiencing horrific hallucinations my mind certainly cant come to accept this as reality
product received for freeearly access reviewfun and easy to play once you get the basics down a bit grindy for the ships but once you find the ship you really enjoy playing its great
at the time of the review i have about seven hundred hours logged on steam version path of exile is a hardcore action rpg with a lot of depth it will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers however this game is absolutely fantastic pros and cons can be subjective so ill just point out main pointshardcore can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals not recommended for your first arpgfreetoplay but not paytowin gggs microtransaction system is very fair almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in microtransaction store gives anyone an advantagerealistic gritty graphics i personally love the graphic and art style but it is highly subjectivemusic varies from meh to absolute blasts from boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies sound design is pretty solid good voice acting and realistic soundssupport is great and quick i personally had great time using itgame has classes however the class only changes how your character looks and from where heshe starts from the skill treecharacters can use any skills or items if they have required stats skills are skill gems that can be socketed in to itemsridiculously flexible and huge skill tree you can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided skill tree consists of little upgrades for example three life regeneration or twelve more physical damagesome people dont like this but those small upgrades stack fast i personally love the freedom of the skill treegame is based on leagues so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new thingslot of equipment variance you can find buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple onestrading is decent but should be worked on you either need to yell to chat or use third party websites to make trades game has no auction houses or player shops ingameleveling can be quick or slow depending on build and skill max level is one hundred and you can reach level seventy in one thousand and fifteen hoursthe game has three difficulties normal cruel and merciless you will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline story currently is composed of three acts 4th one is coming soon and you complete those acts in each difficulty this can be very boring since it can feel like the game is repeatingthe endgame is a map system you can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs i personally love this system since it offers a lot of variance varying difficulties and different experiencesthe dsync should be fixed in the awakening expansion basically you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen this can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration but should be getting fixed soon only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game glad to see it goingi might have forgotten some main points overall i think path of exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and i recommend it whole heartedly edit now at over 3k total and the atlas of worlds expansion is fantastic
i dont really know how to feel about this game its like hearthstone but with elder scrolls cards i think if it had more content more in depth card building ability i could see it being good i wish they would have gone the mtg route instead of what the did if they would have taken their time and wanted to make this game good they damn sure could have i think it would have truly been special but they didnt its almost like they were trying to ride the wave of games like hearthstone i feel like each game takes little to no thought process i got bored of this just like i got bored of heartstone sad
"bloons td battlesaudience beginner casual gamer normal gamer expertgraphics bad alright good beautiful fantastic difficulty easy average medium hard impossiblegameplay frustrating sleepy boring fun challengingbugs bugs destroy game many bugs few bugs can be used for speedrun none encounteredlength really short zero three hours short four seven hours few hours eight twenty hours long two thousand, one hundred and fifty hours very long fifty one thousand, one hundred hours"
overall a pretty polished game the backgrounds are detailed enough to look nice without giving off massive lag the character animations look natural and most of the dragons look great like all free to play games there are many parts of the game that are blocked off until you purchase them unlike many other games of its kind you can get access to most of the content without paying a dime there are many loading screens but youre gonna come across those with any unity game or even 3d game for that matter again for a free game you get a lot more than you paid for
early access reviewdont play this new epic loot update its a trap for monetary reasons youll earn nothing and just spend hours in matches to earn blocks you cant even reasonably get the items you want to build your own bots anymore even if you pay theres a high likelyhood youll earn nothing for that money its a skinner box and the devs wont listen to change that just look on their forums and see the outcry they only want to deepen their pockets they care far less for their players
was bored through the entire forced tutorial only to be matched with only people with the exact same tier tank as mine which means progression means nothing your competition will always be just as strong did not enjoy any of the one hour fiftytwo minutes of playing this the original world of tanks is a lot better
early access reviewso i shoulod start off and say this game is amazing the team behind it are the same that made strike suit zero the actual devs are awesome people to talk with and the game is very fun to play think league of legends dominion but with huge capital ships in space if you are after a different game to play grab this as its lots of fun and the devs are great as well as the community see you star side people
"i thought this would be different from mobile version well im dissapointed because i already hate the mobile version why cause its not how you play real yugioh two field spell card at the same time and three space for card zone wtf dude im so sorry dislikedisyugiohi play this because i love yugioh and this game is wow good dueling trading and levelup systems and those unecessary first gen cards like lvl5 seventeen million, one thousand, one hundred normal monster it make this game even more beautiful"
the combat is boring youre just pressing one or two and then spamming the r button to finish you combo when using a qwertz keyboard the set switch is mapped on the ö button so to switch sets i need to move my hand of wasd and i cant find the button layout settings the performance is bs you cant tell me that i can play eso on high at sixty fps but this game wont even run at low above fortyfive fps when switching to full screen mode the game doesnt render anymore and only the 2d elements stay on the screen overall i wouldnt recommend this game and after a few minutes i was already bored and annoyed by this game
early access review i have played hearthstoneelder scrolls legends duelystmtg and many more and this is the first game that i have writen a bad review for its a fun game yes but with the recent patch they have broken the game its just argenport everywhere and if thats not bad enough its more about rng then skill you can have an awesome game going then somebody gets mana screwed and thats game i really tried playing this game but its mana is all messed up the meta is the same and the players even complained to the dev on this game about how broken it is but they wont listen so im just leaving this game one hundred do not recommend playing
this game is very good the new expansion brought new mechanics that are sure to modify some metas and that is perfect upon logging to this skyrim expansion you will also get a free random deck composed of both some old and new cards which is a nice touch the two lane system is refreshing so is the runeprophecy system giving it a edge over the competition of course some will say pay to win and yes those who can buy packs or campaigns will get a wider choice of cards for their desks but its still achievable with patience for a totally free to play player to beat one who spent strategy plays a good role although being a card game rng is here and can work for or against you the production value is set pretty high as cards are voiced making it feel a but more immersive if you love card games this one has plenty to offer of course be warned you will have to win quite a few matcheslevel up to save up gold to unlock campaign or arena tries i took time to pass over one hundred hours to give my true free to play opinion and sincerly even if some decks completely destroyed me most of the time strategy and a good flowing deck made experience very enjoyable so far best card game i played in or out of steam and i tried plenty
early access reviewthis game is so horrible i know that this game us fee but the graphics 210no story many lag in all of its serversi dont recommend u to play this ing game
early access reviewit finally happened 29ish hours in and just about every game every game that counts draft or foundry power mana screwed oh well i got twentynine hours of entertainment for free
theres not a lot of space games on the market that many can get behind somewhere down the line devs effectively equated space with complexity so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets graphs and pure busywork however the genre continues to be an itch i can rarely scratch with the rare exception rebel galaxy being one this is another as the synopsis demonstrates this is a creepless moba it has much of the staples zone control for resources except those resources mostly translate to team experience you zone back to a base in order to level up comparable to how you buy items in dota or lol after that its just a 5v5 beatem up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment like many space games you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage youd otherwise receive like with many teambased games its more fun when you play with friends when pugging i lost against ai because everyone pulled a lone wolf mentality that just does not work here a lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support a tank ship cannot 1v2 unless he has a support ship on his back one match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back as they should but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us the list goes on there is also no pay to win here at best with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra ten utility here some four damage there and only serves for diehard minmaxers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs the real game here is to pick a few of your favorite ships adapt to their styles and just win with superior skill and it wont matter if an enemy does an extra six damage or not everything else is mostly cosmetic with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other f2p one of the things i want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the games playability or mechanics but the ship designs are some of the best ive seen in a long time just opening the games tutorial giving the overview of the pioneer gave me some epic feelings and then just looking at ships from the hangar menu you can tell a lot of love went into their designs every inch is covered you can see storage bays lights under metal panels antennae kudos to the designers ive met many like me needing a space game without it feeling like a second job this one fits the bill space moba thats what it is
matchmaking sucks so bad it wont even show me my entire match history i genuinely think i have eighty loss rate since the last year and im just trying to be a freaking casual playing on and off a few games a month game used to be easy you hit level thirty and the matchmaking will match you with any other level thirty player being casual or not its time to take the boner they had prepared for you throughout the first twentynine levels
if minecraft and starbound had a baby then creativerse would be its name the graphics are extremely awesome and are more detailed than any other voxel type game the features in the game stick out as well such as different block bundles and blueprints the game also has a neat way for new players to get some great blocks early through redeem codes from game streamers also many of the the community worlds have a great helpful community very friendly and helpful as well im so addicted to the game
this is the sequel to the first big 3d mmorpg and i really like it its part of that world of warcraft generation of mmoâ s much like lotrorift and wow but with alot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much this game is fantasy turned up to eleven
early access reviewthis game would be great if it wasent a flakey unreliable game that is a complete money dont get me wrong this game is incredibly fun but its mostly a paytowin kind of game after a certain point also the launcher is very unreliable and only lets you launch the game about fifty of the time
the devs need to learn to actually work on a game before they put it in the store and the zombies are too much there are way to many guns for a zombie invasion and the only thing that works is the uninstall button i like alot of games but this is bad with extreem ptw
early access reviewthis game is actually not bad its the kind of game you hop on to burn off some time and have some good laughs with friends in the competetive aspect its not as good as pubg or h1
early access reviewpros75 card deckconstructed deck building most similar to mtg magic the gatheringmultiple play formats player vs ai player vs ai draft ranked pvp ranked drafting pvpyou keep all cards you get from draft pickingreward system is very goodi am a free to play player i did spend three for the extra pack deal i have been playing two months and have eighty five of the cards feels good man
had a good chance but its been a year since i have played it and when i installed it recently it was still not optimized with huge frame issues from going really high fps to low fps too frequently and when you jump from a moderate hight your character glitches into the ground but you dont get stuck or anything just looks ugly overall to many frame issues that are still present a year later making the game feel less progressed then it should if the optimization issues go away then i would deffinanlty give it a good review i will check back in a few months
early access reviewuse to play aq and aqw when i was younger so really hope this game gets good tips that can imrpove the quality of life in the game nerf ability damage and reduce cast time alot right click should rotate screen and hide cursor bind a key to autoloot bags f to search f to collect all or click to claim individually give enemies a bit of life to them seeing enemies stand around doing nothing is boring ui is minimal and nice but the quest menus could be designed a bit better
early access reviewsame that doesnt make mtg fun to play sometimes land flood and land screw it doesnt help that you get hit with this so early on in the game i cant push through the beginner campaign because its just not fun drawing unplayable cards turn after turn i was hoping that a new game that tries the mtg formula would have some things to mitigate the mana issue like hearthstone did also didnt like the interface cards look too small on the board and theres some space wasted on the sides that could be utilized
early access reviewtldr check back in a month loot system doesnt reward game is ludicrously grindy played since release presteam game was always grindy but now its worst than a korean mmorpg you get these crates which contain from one to four items depending on the mode you played if youre premium you get twice an many items items now have a rarity with the coolest being legendary and the essentials being whiterareepic the concept is cool but the items you get are essentially garbage lets say you have premium and you open a protonium crate you earned from acheveing top place in battle arena which is like thirty minutes a sample crate would be after the fix patch seven green items and one blue item doesnt sound bad right a hover 20x triangle cubes 20x window cubes thats your rare a single wheel 20x corner cubes a bottom left corner mask cosmetic the flag of poland and a rudder as a new player you cant make much out of that you can upgrade your existing robot but only to a certain point as a played with an ok stock of basic items and a working robot my situation you cant do anything with that and as a veterant player its all garbage problem is the distribution of items in the top tier crate protonium is something like ten white sixty green twenty rareblue ten epic zero legendary and amongst the item pool are cosmetic items masks window blocks flags and you only get one item of each except cubes you get twenty of those so unless your idea of a robot is a handful of blocks with a wheel a hover and a thruster and a single gun this game will make you work very hard to get a working set of items even more so if you want to upgrade from the tier its just not fun the rewards arent rewarding and they arent coherent there is this recycleforge system but right now you get twenty of the value of the item so if you take all the items from that protonium crate you can melt them down and craft one or two tier smgs you need like nine to be effective at four hundred robits each lets say you want to craft that flak cannon that guy blew you up with over and over in the last match seventyfive thousand robits that shotgunlike thing that other guy blew half you bot off in one hit with one hundred and twentytwo thousand five hundred robits thats a lot of crates like three hundred three hundred premium topplace victories in battle arena the longest match mode if you lose you get the bronze crate regardless of your performance a positive point in all this is that the crate tiers seem to not matter so you can just practically idle lose the game and get your 8item bronze crate and progress as fast as that other guy with his carefully crafted bot and hard earned victory thats getting protonium crates check back in a month
its a real good game love it but one problem need more buildings to get in too aswell as get on roofs and fix when you hit zombies with a car kill them dont chrash and do nothing to the zombies but offer all its an amazing game keep up the good work
1010this is the diablolike with the most depth and design complexity ive ever played theres so much character development possibilities the game is amazing at giving tools to create the most crazy and ambitious builds and to make it incredibly rewarding from the gigantic passive tree to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works its so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character and then the world of wreaclast is just amazing to explore lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diablo one the soundtrack is incredible as well hand down my favorite diablo like and one of my fave games of all time and its truly free money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help the few cons you cant turn the camera meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when youre a long range hero self founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game act two is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game

i love dungeons dragons rpgs this game uses the most edition i like from dd the 4ed it have a great forgotten realm adventure focused on neverwinter city and its pvp is also fun to play
early access reviewhonestly a better version for pubg i have pubg and it is very without a good pc you cannot play it at all i thought that it would be the same for this but no it is so much better the graphics are stunning and it is so smooth there are minor bugs that i have experienced and such a fun game to play with or without friends i also has amazing optimisation and visuals with massive mountains and trams everywhere also this game brings a whole new thing with battle royale where it is quick and there isnt any drop from the plane bull nine hundred and ten favourite game at the moment
early access reviewhave to pay a free two play game just to get the most out of the game love building and destroing but good i see coments that it wasint this way so this makes me more till all are one
early access reviewone of my favorate games ever and thats a lot coming from a long time gamer im not goinng to spoil it all but ill just say im speechless of how amazing the game is it has everything a game should have flawless game for being a early accsess and i just say that because of the textures are not one hundred amazing but thats being picky still overall best game ever thats it so much fun downlaod this game you wont regret it
awesome game big fan of ace combat series warthunder and apache so obviously im a huge fan of air combat simulators this one is highly detailed with awesome graphics that leave me wishing for two things a better gaming computer and more content not that there isnt plenty already
this a ton on my phone back in the day didnt clock any hours on this pc version but maybe i will someday still its worth checking out especially if youre a fan of the bloons td games or td games in general note there is a fair amount of grind for towers but dont worry eventually youl get there d
early access reviewreally wanted to like this game started out okay had a pretty positive kd ratio fun hiding from tanks and airplanes the progression is just too slow sixty hours to hit level five still have the same guns ive had since the beginning because you have to repair your so you can never save up the to buy upgrades or move forward they have this set up to force you to spend money im tired of it best part about this game is uninstalling
this game sucks just walk really slowly around looking for the one of animals that inhabit the ing place realizing you dont have a license to shoot the damn thing no you gotta pay for that crap
im not really sure how many hours i have at this point i started somewhere back in twenty elevens and have two max level acounts this is by far the most intense and skill based moba out there every attack you must place yourself on the target there is absolutely no hand holding in this game now that its on steam i cant hold myself back the only reason it took so long is because it was so popular they didnt even need to bother get it now
one its free2 its simple3 sexy girls what are you waiting for careful if u interested of steam trading cards even if you buy dlc you will not get cards it seems so see reviews of dlc
early access reviewcoming from hearthstone and magic duels this game is combination of the two but better than both heavily addicted to this right now graphical style of hearthstone and complexity of magic the gathering all in one cards are well designed and very interesting game is quite generous for cards and packs there are many game modes including a true draft format my only complaint is that game has the ancient stupid land sigil in this based mana system of mtg so be prepared to be mana screwed or flooded occasionally hearthstones simple but effective mana system is simply better
the game was really good but unfortunately after the expansion fall of the dark brotherhoodreal cash to play or 3k gold which us a lot to grind it has kinda become slightly a pay to win game because it gives you some best op cards in the game which everyone uses almost everyone uses same op decks it has become ridiculous literally same decks which kinda kills the point and fun of the game i still play it because i managed to scrap sam good cards before the expansion so i can still be competitive but i cant imagine how a new player could survive this bs
this game is so boring it doesnt even give you an idea of what youre suppose to do it just throws you in at a random camp site and you have to work the rest out yourself310 dont even consider downloading
super steep learning curve but incredibly rewarding once you get it right other than a couple tutorials there is almost no handholding at all i wish it were a bit easier to play through but cant really blame the developers as this is a simulator more than anything i played most of this in vr on the vive and is the closest ive come to the experience of flying in real life from any game the translation of the interface to vr has much to be desired but can easily be overlooked by everything else that shines in this game
early access reviewuber pay2win very unbalanced i almost bought premium but now im glad i didntedit33hrs of gameplay still think its pretty unbalanced tanks planes spawn campers vs teams with nothing specially for people just starting maybe they try to get new people to get premium early the game is not bad but not worth buying pricy premium items if it would be a one time deal and without shortcuts for anyone then id spend some money but since its not id recomend the game to one with deep wallet or tons of free time i dont know eithereditcomments from retards will be removed
early access reviewi lost an overwatch comp game because the invasive updater closed my game window in the middle of a game and wouldnt let me get back until i agreed to the update this game installs a background updater that is pinned to the startup it was a pita to get rid of also the game play is buggy and there arent many options in the settings
i played the old flash games in high school with friends and this certainly lives up to those its clear however that this was rushed why do i think its rushed simple theres no exit button you have to tab out and close it or alt f4 there are pay to avoid grinding elements in it which is a disappointment its still an enjoyable bloons td experience though
early access review1010 would rekt noobs again real review amazing game you never get bored but the game needs a bigger varity of pickups and weapons some more maps and legends would be nice and please nerf wu sang good graphics but low enough for any computer to be runnning it it is comparably better than smash bros but legends need better background stories we also need a campaign or some story line we need a better tutorials because when my friend just started he didnt know what to do whats so ever we also need a report button i seen some douches in this game but overall amazing and fun game
i would highly reccommend this absolutely incredible sim the attention to detail in flight dynamics and on board weapon systems really place this combat sim in my top ten you earn every kill you make and gather great satisfaction with every landing you achieve a massive one thousand and ten
"early access reviewedit apparently twenty minutes doesnt justify this review as vaild if we ignore the psychology of making snap judgements and the fact i know what kind of games i like im going to give a longer review based on my short time and explain how i game to my conclusion of not good why i dont feel someone else would enjoy it this doesnt make me a hater because i really enjoyed the 2d adventure quest the gameplay you move with ws and ad turns the camera around behind you you can also move the camera around with the mouse basic click on things do actions based on what said thing is collecting loot is annoying with no real feedback on if you actually picked up the loot and you can only pick it up by clicking on it not by walking over it in my short game time i managed to get through the intro stage and to the main town enough to firgure out the gameplay was fairly standard drivel nothing exicting nothing fun nothing that got me hooked i dont really have much to say other than i didnt enjoy it the interface its awful you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind and then the interface for mobiles was just updated to work on pcs games can be designed to work on mobiles and ported to pc just fine see timberman that was orginally a mobile game and this game doesnt do that very well the font is awful and i could notice some of the textures didnt scale nicely to one thousand, nine hundred and eighty speaking of textures the graphics i really liked the design and style of the 2d game it looked good and had a nice aesthetic to it im not a graphics over gameplay kind of guy and do enjoy games you could argure had poor graphics proteus for example or moirai however this game is selling itself as a mmo that means its hoping ill play it loads if thats the guess im kind of hoping for something a bit better it has ps1 esquie graphics and not in the good way im guessing this is because of the fact its designed for mobiles the writingstory you might feel i cant give a fair review of the story and i would one hundred agree with you im going to talk about it anyway the writing is dire cringe worthy and really unthoughtful you can tell it wasnt done by someone who knew the first thing about writing its not even done in a casual way just boring unfunny unwitty words on a screen it didnt hook me in it didnt want me to find out more or want me to play it was just bad in summary i find this game bad and i didnt enjoy it if you played hours upon hours of the 2d game then this is going to suck and you wont enjoy it if youve never played adventure quest before then who knows you may enjoy this but it is nothing like the game its based on personally save your time and effort and try a different game original review gave it twenty minutes of my life in those twenty minutes i found out it was nothing like the game i wasted so many hours in high school in it has lost a lot of charm on the way poorly written cringe worthy jokes an intresting feature is that you can play the same game on the pc and your phone eventually does mean the pc verison is scaled quite far back dont bother wasting your time on it it is free but i would feel insulted if i had to spend money to try that out"
i gave this a shot after years of waiting and it became free i wanted to fall asleep while i was playing it i guess if you have insomia and want to fall asleep you can play this game to help even with a gtx1050 the frame rates still stutters besides the beautiful character creation which is i think is on par with bdo its really lackluster everything screams stiff the world is kinda bland and combat is this strange stiff and boring tab targeting it attempts to do gw2 quest style but the world and story just isnt as immersive or fleshed out i still can remember till today gws two norn world with thier frozen kegs but bless is just forgettable there just isnt enough culture woven into the races i dont recommend you to play it unless you need insomia relief ps they are releasing bless unleashed on consoles with reworked combat and storyline
pretty good game explore more than five hundred floors rooms of a spooky mansion owned by a cutesy cartoon ghost girl filled with arcademini games puzzle sequences random monsters hunting you down while you try to escape and some pretty interesting plot twists it may be called house of jumpscares but the atmosphere and environment has a large impact on how spooky spookys jump scare mansion can be play with friends for bonus laughter and scares
dont let my time on here fool you ive been playing for quite a long time in the open beta ive been playing card games for about twenty years and esl is easily my favorite f2p ccg right off the bat as you start the story and begin to level up they dump tons of free cards soulstones and gold on you even letting you choose between which ones you want from time to time then you can start leveling solo arena and if you do decently enough the rewards from that will be enough to get you enough runs to become grand champion after thats done you should have a decent enough grasp on arena to start leveling in vs arena and so on the deck size and x3 card limit as well as nonunique legendaries may seem daunting to build a competitive deck but if you settle on an archtype you wanna play and then soultrap aggressively you can build a competitive deck well before youre even finished leveling this game has the most generous prize support of any free to play game and even then the main incentive to buy packs is the bundles that include awesome alternate art versions of select cards other perks include the fact that the game adds at least one new card every month that you can get up to a complete set of as ranked rewards the ability to grind easy soul gems by playing practice mode and the well balanced and diverse meta
early access reviewthius game could be great but so far its horrible for starters you stuck with a massive grind to even get a pistol than dont expect fair fights most the the fights ive been in the match starts with a twenty three to one disadvatage or advantage meaning the game has no auto balance feture and can easily join a game where you are losing twenty one or even more and are being spawn camped the class system seems nice but like everything else feels half finished and thrown together you can switch to another class only after grinding rank and once you join a game as that class your stuck there is no planning and you mainly see games fulll of infantry and nothing else becasue you cant change character to one that is needed on the battlefield the ui and lighting and visual in gerneral frankly are the worse ive seen in a long time the lighting seems to either bee to bright like you just left a dark room or too dark and cant see the fogis so horrrible that you normally cant see or make out an enemy till your five feet from them the grapics are dated and poor quality and the mechanics of the guns and vehicles are even worse frankly i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone and the excuse that its beta isnt working here this is another game that will probably never leave early access becasue it gives the developers and excusss to never fix or finish the game
well as a substitute to monopoly its good although it does have problems a when given the option to start a new table i usually take it as its a good way for players to customise a game for their friends but this usually ends in joining a full table anyway making the option pointless and when you join a full game occasionally you arent able to leave practically forcing you to play a game you dont want to take part in b the game needs a chat function emojis arent enough especially when a player is taking forever to rollc the bots a huge problem they are pretty much impossible to defeat its like they entered god mode or something and its genuinely annoying recommend this game should changes be made
four thousand hours later i was into this game before it went on steam this game is still terrible why one bad netcodingi usually get five hundred and fifteen ping on tf2 servers and im commonly accused of ping masking despite the fact that i just have good internet but in elsword no matter how good your internet is youre going to have bullcrap lag problems that can give you major based on your character i have people in elsword saying that i have the worst internet theyve ever seen but theyre generally new players who cant understand that the real problem is that the netcode is sht and my internet is really fast2 character imbalancesi have a saying in this game that perfectly describes how it is managedout with the old in with the newolder classescharacters are generally thought of within a range of high and low the newer characters are agreeably neither and are regarded as god tier by the community why you ask kog likes to add enormous advantages to the newer characters for some reason probably to get money from exp medals and such the update that really started to screw up the balance many years ago was the s2 update and its just been going downhill from there three communitybecause of kogs alwaysbroken balance the players of the community spend most of their time ranting about how bad everything is rather than playing the game a lot of players specifically ws mains tend to argue about the balance of their characters until no end just to defend their skill there are a few good players that dont do this but its generally something pretty dumb people do4 pvppvp has always been the only reason i ever still play this game the only problem is how easy it is to get away with trollingplaying really cheaply players themselves have had to create a meta for how people should play so nobody gets trolled but it still happens some people will stop at nothing to get those few extra rank points or another rank even sacrificing their reputation along the way5 p2pthere are lots of things that you can only get by being a p2p player 2nd skill slot amirite the game is really pay to play and people that put their money into getting insane gear levels end up being ridiculously overpowered and can stomp on you pretty much regardless of your skill level this has existed all throughout elswords history but has become a major major issue when the economy started getting messed up6 the economyprobably one of the worst parts of the game in general because of how p2p this game is getting certain items really matters but that can be insanely hard with this economy prices are overinflated to hell and some sellers of ice burner sets are only taking cash because of how worthless ed has become in this game youll find that some items are worth over eighteen billion ed starting from the bottom nowdays is very very hard and kog refuses to do anything about it7 the grindit used to be worse but nobody likes grinding for their levels and gear id much rather just pvp in the freaking game now the major problem is korea has different exp tables than na which makes the grind a lot easier on them this developers seem to only cater to the needs of the korean players and pay almost no attention to na tldr unless you find out a way to play the korean elsword this is not a game you want to play
the idear is good but sadly it doesnt realy execute the term unlockin the dlc means you can work out the skill tree but not that you alrady can work with them also keep in mind for the steam version you need internet conection if i knew this i didnt even buy the starter kit and read a book or two the concept works but that is sayed with it if they improve this its a good game simulator
i find this game fun to play during prime time hours it is sadly in a state where you can only get the big battles during peak times which seems to be in the evening i have had great unique long drawn out battles that cannot be duplicated in other fpss wonderful firefights that are reminiscent of the old alteric valley in world of warcraft where battles last for hours and both sides are trying to push past a choke point the experience this game gave me made me wanting something more from the genre it is the kind of shooter i hoped the genre would have turned to and evolved from rather than pubg and fortnite so much potential
early access reviewi like the game easy on the eye nice physics on movement and shooting not hit a laggy server fast paced but not manic like doom or unreal maps remind me of cod black op nuke nice balance between camping and rushing players just over an hour in not seen any hackers as yet one of the best free to play shooters ive played in years congrats to the devs nice job guys
early access reviewthe game is abnormal fantastic something new in the world of battle but shoting is bad hell u cnt fix anything u cnt play normal it is very sad but thats how it is for now i will put finger up i m waiting for update and fix this if not a lot of player will stay with down and leave this game
causes mood swings eating disorders triggered sociopathy and a chronic breakdown of human decency also fufills the second language requirement for numerous eastern european universities forty two thousand and ten would play again
awesome street basketball game with emphisis on teamwork and lots of sparkling rewards from mini games everywhere lots of fun best experienced with friends or likeminded people you can buy power aka stat increases with real money which is a shame but when all comes to all your skill has to carry you regardless at least in the rookie league as its currently free to play there is no reason not to check it out if youre the slightest on the lookout for some teamwork based game
early access reviewthis game feels more like a mobile game than anything else the hud layout appears to be similar to something youd see on a mobile game the camera feels wonky and its a lackluster grindfest
reviews for the deaf and hard of hearingrereviewing overall gametf2 is fantastic there are a horde of game modes to play that can keep you coming back to this old game for a while while i prefer mvm these days i do often play community servers for a good ctf or payload round most fps games tf2 uses wasd space and control for mobilityrelated issues keys can be easily rebound to whatever suit your capabilities i rebound cruch to space and jump to a side mouse key for example as for sound with the exception of spies and spyrelated events such as sapping of your equipment there are visual cues to accompany the audio for some weapons that you can hear being fired you may not be able to see that youre being shot at such as some sniper rifles this is something to watch out for for gameplay accessibility i give it one thousand and ten you can realistically play and succeed at all of the normal nonmod game modes available with or without sound subtitles captionsfor deafhoh gamers tf2 offers subtitles and captions something valve has a solid history of providing ive found the default captions lacking in mvm however fortunately there is a way to use external captions and i have turned to clovervidia for that http steamcommunity id167785751as a deaf gamer i use captions over subtitles whenever i have the choice as the distinction tends to be between important information in captions and flavor text in subtitles that said i have not used the subtitles option for tf2for captions i give it six hundred and ten normally nine hundred and ten with external captions such as from clovervidia supports ingame voice communication but the pacing of the game does not make it essential gameplay can tolerate typing so many other players in servers tend to have no problem accommodating having to type even so many game modes dont require much communication for casual play for mvm typing can be made difficult at times and this problem can be exacerbated by queuing random teams each time you play and having to explain things repeatedly which can be a gamble ive written a guide to try to standardize voicebind calls in mvm until valve changes voicebinds to be more inclusive if ever http steamcommunity id358478951overall accessibilitytf2 incorporates visual signals for almost everything that happens in game its ability to rebind keys and add custom captions make it pretty accessible for most deficits in the gaming population overall nine hundred and ten
early access reviewonce was a nice game one by one all cool features got removed now its i dont get why u would remove nice things i cant even ing play solo at the moment
this is probably the best mmorpg game that i have played my entire lifetime the characters are very unique from each other to expand on this a little more every character has their little special something for example add does not have an awakening mode but instead has something called dp mode forgot what dp stands for also the layout of the fields and dungeons are amazing the soundtrack is also something i enjoy you can even marry someone in this game just a random tidbit of info the list of things that make this game awesome and very entertaining in my opinion just keeps going for miles and i dont want to take the time to make the entire list because that would takes moons to type but all in all this game is very creative and unique and better than other mmorpgs that i have played and probably the most enjoyable
story dd game a normal fantasy story not so good not so bad just normal 610cinematics laggy old looking but still makes you wanna four more hours then they put another cinematics and thats go on like all the game 910music and sounds good and basic musics that dont hurt your brain so much seven hundred and ten graphics old dark looking good atmosphere giving stuff not so good on light putting tho 810content for a f2p game there is so much to do but still you feel like somethink missing 810controls basic dd controls if you are not use to it that stuff its a bit hard 710gameplay its says f2p but there are thinks you need to buy if you want to enjoy the whole gameplay 610make this game fifteen dolarmake every content free work on it bit more add more dungeons raids and pvp arenas like you want to make a game for someone you love improve light and story there you go a good game
reasons to play smite youre getting tired of the old moba formula and you want a new twistyou like thirdperson action gamesyou like competitive teambased games that require strategy and teamworkyou want something fun to play with your friends for free you have no better way to spend your time since you have no life responsibilities note i have many more hours than what is displayed as i have played this game before it was released on steam since the day it came out of beta in fact
early access reviewfinally uninstalled after the last patch it had so much potential to be a good game devs think the community are idiots and wont listen to a word they say im done rip
wandered through about ten rooms without seeing anything then i get startled by an adorable cardboard ghost lots more rooms some more cutesy cardboard jumps and a few notes â â â â â ing about how thirsty the writer was then i found a note that just had some weird stuff about choking sounded crazy i turn around and oh my god what the â â â â is that that is not cute or cardboard nope nope nope im out of here hey i wonder if it followed me into this next room nope it followed me nope nope nope
early access reviewthis game is lot of fun it is heavily inspired by minecraft which i can tell but it is really original too since its free to play posibbilities in game are endless if you have pretty good imagination and creativity you can build some pretty cool stuff but ya ill rate one thousand and ten for this game because it is simply amazing game i recomend this to anyone who enjoyed playing minecraft or any new people to the genre
"after sinking over one thousand, three hundred hours into the game i have decided that i may as well write a review the big question is where do i begin if you are a new player planning on playing planetside two go right ahead the first hundered hours that i played this game where filled with the most rewarding atmospheric and epic gameplay experience i have ever had the pleasure to enjoy in any multiplayer fps game witnessing my first zerg was quite a sight to behold the battlefields of auraxis choked with armor infantry and aircraft amazed me as i had never witnessed anything of the scale battles that rage for days where both sides get pushed back and forth with the ebb and flow of the red tide of blood was really quite a thing to witness the unknown lands that seemed to stretch into infinity detailed as far as the eye could see i was simply astounded by the scale and atmosphere soon enough i met some players on my faction that invited me to an outfit we became very good friends and remain so to today even though we dont play planetside very much anymore the satisfaction that comes with accomplishing tangible goals through teamwork is definitaly the most rewarding part of the game wether that goal is as simple as destroying an enemy vehicle or as profound as shifting the tide of a battle where hundereds of players are engaged these victories are truely the best part of planetside 2unfortunatly planetside two is not without its problems many of which are so embedded into the core of the game that they are unremoveable the realization of these has turned me into a grizzled veteran in the war on auraxis i simple cant go back to those first hundered hours the massive scale of ps2 often leads to onesided battles where the losing side is totally outnumbered and are pushed back base after base untill the amass enough players to engulf the enemy in an even bigger swarm the unique armament of the waring factions ensures that one side will always have somthing very powerful that the others do not the gameplay balance is in a constant state of flux doomed to forever nerf and buff never achieving true balance the grind can be quite painful at times especially for new players this only encourages new players to use the cash shop to purchase weapons and exp boosters with their own money the player classes are in no way balanced one being much more powerful than the others despite all this i would still reccomend you playe planetside two even with the poor balance and painful grind for exp cherish the good moments in this game and try not to take it too seriously find a faction you like and join an outfit dont spend money untill you are sure you will play for a while im not sure what the future will hold for planetside two but im sure as hell that ill want to be there to witness it live free in the nc"
"great game to help strengthen your friendship includes great features like by aspired and bedtime some may say its all luck and p2w but theyre just sore losers the game is so good they inspired a hit boardgame called monopoly you may have heard of it one thousand, two hundred and twelve must have"
pros very fair f2pp2w model the intructory storytutorial is alright just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda but the game deserves praise for giving you access to a generous number of fifty cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start or at least after finishing the tutorial you can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of skyrim expansion with ingame currency in less than thirty hours of gameplay i was able to buy two of these decks for one thousands coins which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorialstory great art tes designs at their best each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at and they all come with accompanying sound effects andor voice over the games rng is one hell of an important factor in winning games theres a big overlap between what a common card can do when rng favors it and what a legendary card can do when rng is not in its favor what this means is that you absolutely do not need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it good cards give you an edge but good deck synergy and rng still reign supremegreat carddeck identity the game really benefit from the tes theme each card and deck built around it oozes personality and each combination of different races or lack of yields a solid recognizable theme different from all others recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game this ties into the games balance learn to pace your decisions every deck has a certain rhythm to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains learn them to make the most of each deck cons way way way too many rng mechanics yes this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game but youll eventually be on the receiving end of the rng beating numerous cards have effects such as summoning a random creature no not a random creature from your deck any random creature from the entire game you will get screwed over by a hail mary at some point you need to learn to accept that this also ties into the next con built in comeback mechanic as you burn through your opponents life points youll break a total of five runes each time you break a rune your oponent draws a card if your opponents card is a prophecy card theyll be able to play it immediately with no cost this can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly so most of the games meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times you are never entirely safe overall i recommend the game to all fans of tcg games if you ever played a tcg game you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it and you dont have to pay a price of entry just to see if its going to appeal to you
the huger games mode dosent even work because every time i try to load it all it does is just freeze closes walking takes so long to get to one location to another and finding a car is basically impossible there are no oceanic servers making it hard for people like australia to play this game and cant change the resolution of the game without it freezing and then when i return to the game it dosent change
early access reviewi know its an early access game and it has been released for about four days but im not gonna recommend it because pros great atmospherecool animationsdumb funny armours helmets loot boxes footwears etc you can open windows climb ladderscons a ridiculous launcheropening many useless tabsnot much available options to optimize the gamegameplay is not so smooth you cant even climb a laddersmall amount of players almost twenty for each game i had to search the whole map to find 1however ive played it for less than an hour but these are the things i came up with
early access reviewthis is what we all had hoped mtgo would become if you are a magic refugee looking for a digital ccg nothing comes closer than eternal the tutorial is too long and boring but once you get into ranked ladder and draft yes actual drafting it is quite awesome
mighta been a good game i will never know wouldnt respond to the contoller keyboard or mouse all which work on every other game i have read other reviews before diving in on this one
early access reviewgreat game lots of fun play modes against other players or the ai lots of free rewards and daily quests to start the game and accumulate the cards even going the free to play route regular balance patches and epansions a diverse meta of aggro mid range and control decks and lots of content to exploregreat game allaorund i really enjoy playing it and urge you to try it toomake sure to check out the subreddit at www reddit comreternalcardgame and www eternalwarcry com as well
what i like everything specialy the characterswhat i hate i must pay some money to get awesome things like costumes because the cheapest costume in the mall it cost at least twentysix dollars one dollar one hundred kching
ninety nine of the reviews on the hunter are negative because people complain about how it is marketed as a free to play game if you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money but after you get a membership the game becomes sooooooo much better you need to be patient to play the hunter and by the looks of the other reviews not many people on steam are make sure you play the tutorials or you will have no idea what you are doing and maybe watch a youtube video or two e g thehunter beginners guide twenty sixteens by hoocairsthehunter if you are a new guest i recommend sticking to the towers and calling the deer to you as they can see smell and hear you alot better with guest clothes on there is free shotgun in the store which i dont think many guests know about so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting dont worry about wasting ammo because it is unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge or go pheasant hunting and if you like it buy the membership i also recommend going to thehunter on wikia as it gives you tonnes of information on reserves and where you can specifically find the animals
so i played the game for free actually enjoyed it told my brother he enjoyed it too to play together we jopined someone elses server so that wasntt really an issue i thought to myself well i want to hunt more than the basic stuff tbh so i bout remium three month licence then somethning magical happened even after the liscence you need to pay more money to buy the right weapons for certain kills then the right ammo then more money for scentless gear then more for hides and tents and scopes and anything else even remotly enjoyable i tweeted them about it they dont care
autistic eleven gear carried players can beat you in three hits then call you a spamming noob as they play the most broken classes using the most broken gear half the community is full of fat antisocial otaku who try really hard to act normal and conform to normal social standards i e mimicking black memes what are those deez nuts etc and its really really cringe worthy because being a lightskin myself its emberassing knowing that some fat greasy whiteasianmexican kid is trying to act like me and associate himself with my culture pve is boring the algorhytms for ice burners are broken to say the least i had a friend open up two hundred and fifty worth of ice burners only to get six pieces of the actual set extras included some classes are unplayable because of how they arent broken enough to stack up with others servers are poorly maintained and are constantly laggy my guild master is laggy as and he lives a whole hour away from me with the level boost event you would think kog would have the idea that making bigger and more servers would be a thing to put on their list guess not gotta push out another ice burner and item mall event
please dont play this game ive played about one thousands hours game is so â â â â ing good but the players i brooke my door for a game like ten minutes ago â â â â this game â â â â valve â â â â dota â â â â players â â â â everything
this is a side activity video game and you can play it while you play your main gamewhat i mean with that lets say that you are playing dota two and you die while you are dead you can do some clicks in this game to get gold until you are revived in dota 2i dont see a reason to buy the dlcs except if you want to help the developers1010 pcg pc console gamer p
a game with a good concept combat system and characterclass design and has potential but has horrible optimization and playerfriendly settings on top of that targeting modes are different for classes some have action and others have classic which is autistic for two reasons one already it changes the gameplay for each person drastically how can you make pvp like this even if a targeting mode wouldnt work for a system make a work around thats farier for players2 its better for each person to choose the targeting mode they want test them out maybe swap between them rather than forcing it onto them makes for a more friendly system and better gameplay
early access reviewas a person that has played aqw for over seven years i have to say that this game dissapoints me further than i expected i thought it was going to be alot more fun and an upgrade from the 2d game i used to play but this gameit doesnt matter if i played just like ten minutes but it was a waste of time it is basically wow but with a mix of aq and aqw in it really dissapointed i played the alpha and it was amazing but this is a piece of
supernovas happen because of when a sun is formed it has a lot of gravity this gravity pulls the mattermostly hydrogen into the core of the sun where it undergoes extreme amounts of pressure and causes the hydrogen to fuse when the hydrogen fuses it turns into helium and this fusion gives of a small amount of energy but remember there are billions of these fusions happening simultaneously so that energy adds up real quick when it releases energy the particles have the energy to fight the intense gravity which is why stars growdont immediately collapse now helium is denser than hydrogen so it goes down father into the core and gets fused as well the helium is fused into oxygen and carbon and emits even more energy for the matter to fight gravity and expand but then theres a problem when carbon and oxygen fuse into iron no energy is given off this means that the star will started having an iron core but no problem because you still have some hydrogen and helium and stuff but eventually all the hydrogen will run out leaving the denser helium oxygen and carbon to fight the intense gravity then the helium goes and then gravity starts to take its toll the star begins to shrink because the fusion of oxygen and carbon doesnt produce enough energy to fight gravity until eventually gravity packs the oxygen carbon and iron closer and closer without enough energy to fuse or fight back then the gravity becomes way too much for the matter and the star implodes ripping apart some of the iron and carbon and oxygen back into their original heliums and hydrogens and creating a massive cloud of irradiated dust ready to start the process all over again and if the star is big enoughaka has enough mass like a blue giant star all the heavy elements in it keep of compressing pass the supernova point and becomes a singularity some of the stuff does go supernova but most of it goes into the singularity
this is better than most tcgs due to better strategies within the variety of cards available like most tcgs it is more pay for less grind than pay to win if your casual i would skip unless you dont mind spending a little to get a decent set of cards i do feel the cards you obtain from campaign and bought card sets are decent to the point you dont need to spend too much initially to get going i do recommend purchasing one of the discount packs as they are a great deal and youll have a decent starting cards to create a deck that suites your play style i previously gave a thumbs down for the draw system per their recommendation i looked at their website and got some tips that helped it looks like i did need to include search type cards to help situations that result in too much power or units some of the new modes are interesting as well i changed my recommendation to recommend as this dev is responsive and helpful overall for a tcg this one has great potential
this is an amazing game at first i thought this was another minecraft ripoff but i decided to try it anyways i was absolutely stunned with the results the graphics are amazing little to no lag openworld survival and best of all its free i would definitely recommend this game especially if you like minecraft
hi i played duel links for only a few days i built a meta deck and got to legend one rank in two days heres my two cents on the game not really a fun game too much grinding necessary pve is boring seriously it is using auto duel is boring i wish they removed pve completely competitive decks change every time a new card pack comes out in the shop high level pvp is quite boring since you will be using the same meta deck as your opponent the grind from legend three to king of games is t since you need five wins in a row to get too kog from legend three so you might be stuck bouncing from legend twelve and three for the entire season
early access reviewlongtime aqworlds veteran here been playing since twenty tens this game is pretty good so far it still feels like the classic aqworlds keep up the good work aritx entertainment
early access reviewthis game is full of russian servers which means six hundred ping sad i hope there are europe servers soon because the game looks really fantastic but servers and ping is the issue atm ill be waiting for europe servers for this game
early access review its world war two game i love the game about world war two good gameplay it fun and if you play with your friend it truely fun it like a battlefield game you can play tank fighter plane sniper paratrooper or you can modified your infantry to antitank guys markman machine gunner no team play i doesnt see anyone play like team they play for their own so many camp sniper camp tank camp no killcam for camping sniper seriously hard to see the enemy i doesnt say graphics are bad but it hard to spot iron sights are too small i love to play rifie and i miss every shot orz rifie can upgrade to automaticrifie well pay two win yes it likelybut keep it work the game is still good
early access reviewas of right now i firmly believe aq3d is strictly for the fans a good nostalgia trip and vast improvement over the other games in terms of frame rate alone still rough around the edges for now but hey its still early access lets just hope its not permanently early access
to sum up what is being said within the twenty thousand reviews is pretty long but in short it goes like this for people new to this game it is a brillaint second world war arcady flight sim with different styles of play and many different aircraft later on the game requires a lot of money to actually progress anywhere if you even manage to reach tier four out of five you will understand what i mean by this if your not prepered to put money on this game i wouldnt suggest getting your hopes up for it for people with four hundred hours or those who have played it prior to patch one hundred and thirty seven we all feel your frustration the company switched from the all knowing all loved to the more give us your money what one hundred and thirty seven added was different way of proggression from the much more simple one hundred and twenty tier system with twenty being top and one being the start it was compressed into only five tiers what was expected was rough boundries eg tier four vs tier four well nope if you play tier four your more than likely to experiance the wrath of a mig15 pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game still not the worst part thought both arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the ai gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to give me all your money if you want to be good the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy not to mention unbalanced aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premiuim account or buy paying to progress all this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just infront of it which comes stock so its probably worse the game went downhill from one hundred and thirty seven flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or youll slam into an invisible 50ft tree the games devs werent bad people and still arent theyre running a compnay and it seems they need a way to make more money from it unforunaely this is one of the ways they chose they used to listen and fix almost all bugs and issues now i think money has taken over a once great game that used to be a brilliant now instead it is the biggest example of pay to progress
early access reviewthis is a very fun card game its got complexity and variety compared to other online card games i think this is probably the best ive played deck building is the most fun ive had in a while deck size and limits are sufficiently big to let you experiment while most cards are balanced against each other thus letting you build interesting and unique decks the game has just had one expansion and already theres a huge number of viable and competitive decks out there the best thing about it is that the game doesnt encourage aggro decks nor does it discourage it its perfectly viable to play any kin of deck cards dont depend so much on rng like they do in hearthstone what they do is clear from the beginning as a result you dont feel you depend on luck as much as you depend on your wits the only luck aspect of the game is what cards you draw more on that later there is no deck limit you can have as many decks as you like guess what blizzzard no one is getting confused perhaps the most important feature of the game is that its not pay2win its play2win theres a lot of ways to gain gold cards and packs that dont involve you paying for it every time first of all theres an exclusive game mode gauntlet which you can play for free and as many times as you like you battle against seven ai opponents and each victory grants you a reward chest depending on how well you went you get an appropriate reward and its very easy to gather gold if you are willing to grind for it its not boring either because the ai opponents are random and are actually competent at the game then aside from gauntlet there are two other modes where you need to pay gold or real money to enter draft and forge forge works like hearthstones arena only you battle against ai opponents again draft works like mtg draft games and here you get to fight against real humans whats so great about these modes well aside from the final rewards you can get you can keep all the cards that you drafted thats right you pay twentyfive hundreds gold forge or five thousands gold draft and you get to pick cards according to your collections needs buying packs is one thousands gold and you get ten cards per pack which is well worth it and then to top all this off every single victory you make in ranked or casual play will reward you with some gold and a single card at the very least theres a good chance you can get a card pack out of it i havent payed a single dime so far and i have a very respectable collection i only started playing a couple weeks ago the only real money you pay is for cosmetic stuff and honestly this game is so great and i appreciate the fact that it doesnt hound me to pay it money all the time that i will indeed give it some the devs have earned it the game looks and sounds great the card art is interesting the animations and sound design are really nice and the overall atmosphere is just enticing you to keep playing there are no bugs that i have noticed so far havent had a single disconnect or server issue its only downsides for me are constantly drawing mana cards can screw you over occasionally there are no reshuffling mechanics in place decks require you to have one mana card in every three cards which can expound the problem its not such a big deal though because this is something that can happen in any card game using mana cards the reverse can also happen occassionally its just luck of the draw rumor has it that applications that help you keep track of your cards can get you banned i cant confirm this but if its true its a bit of a headscratcher the ladder system needs a bit of a rework the game can harshly penalize you for each loss but you dont get an equivalent reward for each win you can be winning more than fifty of your games and still not climbing the ladder overall though these are minor things in the grand scheme of things the game itself is amazingly enjoyable i highly recommend it to anyone interested getting in a new card game
i have tried a few racing games and sims raceroom seems a fairly complete package yes you have to pay for a decent amount of cars and tracks but overall the cars sound amazing and behave very realistic i do not recommend the keyboard but if you have a gamepad or a racing wheel and you like racing sims go for it
early access reviewwhile this game has a promising core the devs are not making use of the potential it has lets get some pros out of the way rewards are generous and get you set up quicklygame looks and runs wellpretty good visualaudio feedback on killshuge arsenal of weaponsthe shop is free of pay2win gear everything premium is cosmeticthe core gameplay is solid and fast to pick up now for the cons map design is horrible demolition is the only gamemode with servicable maps and im being generous hereweapon balance is bad thirty four assault rifles dominate the game with snipers following in their footsteps because of how easy they are to use the rest are just awkward gimmicky weapons to use if you really dont careit has a csgostyle crate system that is somehow worse you need to open random boxes to get another box that you can then open with a paid key and get a random itemgamemodes except for tdm and demolition are bland and rely on low effort gimmicks to make them unique theyre dead for a reason tdm is a spawnkilling simulatoranticheat is a little lacking battleye doesnt do much on its ownthere are absolute zero ways to communicate with your team because of no builtin voip and the dead cannot communicate with the alive players radio commands are extremely limited and often misleading they dont mark anything either so enemy spotted is useless the final nail in the coffin for me personally has to be that the devs show zero intentions to accept community feedback which means the game wont really have a chance to grow there are a lot of issues ive mentioned that just require some updates and itll be perfectly fine but they dont seem to be interested in this approach at all thats neowiz for you the game is still playable but i wouldnt recommend it because of this problem alone
product received for freeearly access reviewyou fight against higher leveled people and lose sometimes most of the time you get people your level though its a very annoying and time consuming like that friend you have otherwise its fine i just dont like it
this is one of the worst racing games i ever played i believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics i had delted the game after a certain amount of time the only good thing is that its free
opponent top decked a one mana spell that creates a random card from one of three factions in a massive card pool he had two crown of possibilities out he randomly created worldbearer behemoth with killer and destiny ten do not play
the goodfree to playnostalgic relaxingthe badmicro transactions seem to be required for some achievements to be completed in less than hundreds if not thousands of hours of game play difficult to get stop raider attacks achievements because all you see is deathclaw attacks once into the game a bit you will never make the top lists on the leader board if you care about that for example i see people with over six hundred rooms you can t have over six hundred rooms there is not enough space overall very good free to play game
early access reviewfor once an actual good br game and its not so demanding like all the others that are being mainstreamed at the moment i can find myself playing this a lot solo or with friends only issue i have with this game so far is that there isnt other races like in the lore of paladins
"early access reviewlisten up this game is honestly one of the best battle royale games ive ever played in my eyes the mechanics and flow of the game is everything pubg shouldve been smooth firefights que times are amazing map is perfect size for a full lobby fun customization my only downside to this game is for them just to fix some minor hitregs and as well as adding a flipping shoulders function cause i tell you what only being able to look over my right shoulder has lost me many gunfights but i know theyll keep this game fun and entertainingfinal verdict eight thousand, eight hundred and ten"
early access reviewplease remove or atleast buff the goddamn chicken its just infuritating to not be able to get away from anything also the heirloom rifle is just aidsits ok overall just balance it more and its all good
early access reviewfun little builderbasic digging game you can waste time playing alone but is most fun if you have a friend to play and build with worth a shot only critique right now is theres not much to do if you get tired of building which has recently improved as there are now awesome free blueprints and somehow my avatar suddenly changed to male with no options to edit it but its worth playing if you like sandbox building games
mediocre yugioh game clunky user interface rules are a bit different than the original i recall decksfields are much smaller way too many currencies and token in game played better verison on gba
"matchmaking for ground forces is abysmal i play br four thousand, seven hundred and sixty seven and in about ninety of all games as germany you will be uptiered fighting jagdpanthers with tiger 1s and dicker maxs fighting tiger 2s and is2s with ing panzer ivs this has gotten out of hand gaijin its time to get off your mountain of f2p money and start fixing your game for your players you lazy russian s"
early access reviewsigh how would i be able to explain how broken robocraft has become akward pausewell lets start with the pros based off center of math and scienceplayer made robotscommunity factory to sell copys of your robotsactual weight to blocksnow on with the consthere are a lot of cons but heres one almost everythinglet me explain i have played this game for so long and im dissapointed about how much of a mess robocraft has become im sorry to say but i dont like it anymore there are constant updates so that robot you just finished making the next day a update comes out and guess what that robot you spent five hours working on renders useless i created my bot many years ago and yet i didnt even think about what i was building it was a burger colored caterpillar i slapped some guns on it gave it some wings and bam called it a robot but there is something a bit worse now balance the game supposedly says please wait while we match you fairly with other players that is a straight up lie you could create some high tech five areoflak cannon bomber and be matched with new players its super unfair and it drives away players freejam get yourself together and bring back tiersever since freejam introduced the community factory it has been a complete flop for me it meant the richer players could make their robots have a five star combat rating and make them even richer while those with limited funds are stuck with the lower star robots making little to no robits off their robots guess what the first thing you look for when you go to the community factory a good robot so robocraft shows almost only five star combat rated robots and only the rich can buy them leave the less rich to have to dig deep to just find a cheap decent robot all these robots are being sold for over 120k robits how are you supposed to make that much it seems the only way is to either churn out money for that robot or simply play match after match after match clan seasons are my main revenue of robits now your only choice to get that much is to either play for crates and hope you get good stuff to sell in the recycle or you have to cough up them dolla dolla bills to buy a ship full of platinum crates and sell everything you get from those crates i cant reccommend this game until its more balanced and gives robits whether or not you win or lose a match seriously hey new players keep in mind rail and plasma for da win
this game is like having diablo two with titan quest and other good stuff mixed with spicy passive talent tree giant spicy passive talent tree and colorfull gems of mass murdering bring friends
im filled with nostalgia when i go back to my very first trove club to still see it remain standing strong even though it is virtually dead atleast i can see where we first plotted our spawn point the musical roads a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the clubs life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours so many friends i stumbled upon during my activeness in the game i love building with my trove buddies more than that actual mining leveling up and slaining bosses happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game
here are things i like about this game complex strategy tons of unique tanks not a pay to win game occasionally gives free premium accounts can ram tanks to their death gets suprisingly intense in sometimes can snipe tanks from afar takes lots of time to go up to the final rank im still tier iv great graphics feels very satisfying to destroy tanks1010 would ram tanks again
early access reviewi have been with this game from near the beginning and though i dropped out of it for a year it was still enjoyable then came the downfall i wouldnt say that the tier leveling update was part of the downfall but after that everything and i mean everything started to go to sh especially the loot crate update and robobits please just stop i miss how you could earn robopoints from matches thus allowing you to buy more weapons and blocks but now robobits only earned from a forge from destroying items hard worked for so freejam i say this bring back the old robocraft at least until the tier flattening update please bring back our beloved robocraft
"fractured space seems to consistently be referred to as a moba and while it technically is its sort of a stretch two teams face off trying to capture the others base thats about it so far and is the essence of its moba classification that makes it a bit boring especially if the team you end on doesnt adjust their ships to complement the others thats really the only negative i can see with fractured space which is a rather big deal since its pretty much the game mode youre going to play the other extras add up to make it a solid f2p game though at three thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine to unlock all thirtyone ships isnt outrageous and they go on sale for one thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine from time to time the graphics are excellent and the added battle chatter from your crew adds to the immersion although i know millions of lives were lost to your incompetence everytime i die i recommend fractured space since its free to play and you have nothing to lose"
early access reviewseriously try the game out for yourself its actually good and the hate the game got early on wasnt deserved the devs have been constantly fixing everything wrong with it so far and have already improved the game tenfold in the matter of two days its not pay to win in any way and the combat is actually engaging and unique dont listen to the negative reviews because theyre just not true try it for yourself and make your own opinion
early access reviewthe first truly free to play card game on the market if you want a good magic style game to play then this is it whether you want to pplay by yourself against the ai or play against others theres always something for you to do to get more cards or play how you want its such that you want to give them money and support the devs because the product is so good and the game is more generous than its peers however because it is a magic clone and not like hearthstone even though the pictures make it out like it could be mana screwflood is always a possibly so losses could come from you having too muchtoo little mana coming and vice versa still an excellent game through and through and i say everyone who likes this style of game should come and play it
i love this game it is exactly the kind of game that i have always wanted and its free sadly with every good there is a bad i can log onto a server and do amazing and get extremely good stuff when i decide that my bag is full with stuff i want i go to a settlement to place it in the safe when i do it either doesnt load it into the safe and it doesnt save it and disconnects me from the game or it will just disconnect me from it when ever it wants i have played a few games that were fine before this started happening and it was really fun now that it is happening i hope it gets fixed so that i can finally have my fun again
early access reviewits a fun game combat is great high end optimazation is not so great but the game looks pretty good even at low settings it doesnt warrant the mostly negative reviews it has i will for sure be sticking around for awhile with high hopes that the devs will fix the issues the game has
looks good to damn hard to set up i have tried to setup the basic thrustmaster usb joystick with throttle its just way to complecated and fiddly just as you thick youve mastered the basics something weird happens with views trims flight automation none of it makes sense it will appeal to a very small target market ill give it one more hour before i uninstall would not play regulary enough to justify the cost of the dlc content what i would like to see is an even more dumbed down version for newbies to flight sims and a magic button to setup joystick controls even loading a named controller from a database would be goodit needs a bf3 mode switch on login join game shoot stuff otherwise its just a flightsimthere are no three week training courses to teach all the details of this game so many will not bother the guides are good but if you cant grasp the basics after ten minutes epic failvote yesno eer uumh yes just which is a shame as so much work has gone in to the game there are just to many hurdles to get you hooked
spend ten hours playing spent five got a random bsod which deleted my save file and in turn the entire vault and all my time and effort dont bother wasting time on this game when it will do something so stupid
i played this game during beta and recently got it on steam when it came out it was an insanely great game fun dungeons always something to do something new to grind towards without being to hard now you can grind for hours upon hours and not even get close to what you want the new gem system was good in theory but was executed poorly classes now cost real money to get really takes away from the excitement making everything untradable has made it hard for new players to get a grip on things that maybe they cant farm or just dont want to spend hours farming the lag has become almost unbearable beta had little lag now i cant climb a dungeon without rubber banding back down its frustrating overall if this game was its former self and easy one thousand and ten but now its a two hundred and ten
i love elsword it is one of the best rpgs ive ever played add is so cute xd its really fun and the skills are really cool however i would not use real money on this i never buy things that cost cash in the game because you use them up quickly and they are expensive it is really fun though with all the things to explore one thousand and ten three
hmm best their is if youre like me who dreams of being in a battlefield when the suns goes down and at desert fieldindar with gunns blazing everwhere and lasersand tanks just having an orgy with occational decced out battle bus with two gunners storming past enemys and lighting up anything it sees even its teammatesnc looking at ya gits
early access reviewin this newest update they changed this game from what it used to be a pay to progress fasterand i paid some money on this into a pay to even have a little bit of succes overall it is ruined with the latest major update go to reddit to see the full extent
early access reviewif you like smash bros you will love this game its much more easier to play with friends and you dont have to come to eachothers houses its a very fun fighting game that my friends and i enjoy a ton and its free
early access reviewso far love it i played all the different artix games like dragon fable epic duel and of course aqw whats been done so far in game perfectly matches the humour of the games and i cant wait to see what this game brings throughout development
it is fun to play even with the main aircraft you get its very realistic and i would recomend it fpr anyone who loves flight sims the combat is some what realistic and you cant throw the aircraft into un realistic manovers
t it said i was disconnected from internet when i was not which used up my free entry into one of the battle arena and gave my oppenent all the medalions i did not get a free entry back this game is t i do not recommend this game to anyone
this game despite being a mmo type free to play with microtransactions blew me away the graphics are stunning the physics are very realistic the planes are beautiful and the combat envrionment is well balanced bravo to ganjin here this is a truly beautifull game in my opinion the best part is that it if one wishes not to participate in the microtransactions it is possible to obtain just about all of the games content and actually compete by simply playing long enough which is better than many other free to plays out there keeping in mind that this game is still in development and balancing is constantly being reworked it is one of the best combat flight simulator games ive played with the planned additions of playable ground and naval units it promises to be one of the best ww2 combat games out there hey whatve you got to loose anyway its free go try it out its got a fifty five from me
if you want to play a mindless touch the screen forever app game then this is one of those i hate garbage like this its made for empty headed nongamers to waste time on their phones thats it
early access reviewits a poor mans red orchestra thats less user friendly and you have to rank up to play the real matches drive vehicles or get a gun that shoots straight for every faction us germany ussr granted it is early access so they could fix the confusing menus
early access reviewthis is the first time i feel like writing a review for a game this game is awesome any hearthstone player will get into this pretty quickly but its way deeper and has some nice and fresh mechanics has several fun single and multiplayer game modes no restriction of farming ingame money like hs in general a way more generous free to play model tons of cards and its just in beta just play it
basicly youtube watching sim1060 min of queue time gameplay is amazing and fun not a copy or knockoff of minecraft community is nice and helpfull spam is almost nonexistent mining is not a grindy process but rather a quick hobby every once in a while p2w is almost useless as everything can be fairly aquired without intensive grinding for money game is fair as quests bosses enimies and all classes are balanced with only minor differences in unbalences each class is unique and competly different and specilised devs are nice and try to fix queue times although they are totally inacturate on the downtime guessesgame is fun and is worth the queue timesi cant spell im sorry
pointless game get into combat get shot at through obstacles get killed right away one has to wonder is it cheating manuever into their rear take shots either bounce or no damage they turn around you are dead updates process is so complex obviously design to get suckers to spend but when it is all said at done the cheating and you inability to inflict damage makes you wonder why spend any money the cheating wont stop just because you spent money and the ramdon effect of shots makes it pointless to even try give it a try but dont get sucked into spending money its not worth it
product received for freeyou know it wouldnt be bad the launcher didnt keep breaking when i download it through steam unfortunately i cant do it through steam because the game or the glyph launcher breaks every couple of days download trove from the trion website and forget about getting it on steam
early access reviewa beautifull and huge scale mmo with nice gfx and weighty combat system higher quality than your typical previous asian mmos with a much better storylore missions very traditional style mmo with an upcoming action mode for the three none beserker classes buy to play and no sub needed especially when max level this games medieval style and castles also put any western and european devs to utter shame why is it this asian mmo has more of a grasp of authentic medieval architecture than actual european devs now the voice acting in some areas is good but prob mostly poor and sometimes very laughable but as this and most asian mmos are pvp foccused endgame should it matter too much in the long term
a solid and userfriendly simracing experience the free content might as well not exist theres not much and i never liked it although objectively the quality is pretty good the real attraction is the paid stuff raceroom has some of the most diverse vehicle and track selections you have generic gt3spec several years of adac gt3 wtcc and an exclusive dtm license complete with all the tracks some openwheelers are available but the only notorious one is the dw12 indycar aka fr us most iconic tracks are included spafrancorchamps monza imola a wonderful rendition of the nuerburgring nordschleife and much more quality wise these are probably the best nonlaserscanned tracks in the industry many more obscure venues appear too mainly in germany due to the dtm license the physics are competent im not the most qualified person to talk about them but you definitely feel the gmotor engine underneath the force feedback is arguably some of the best and the vibration on the gamepad is undeniably the best the ai is very convincing definitely better than any other gmotor two title and maybe even better than rfactor 2overall very much recommended

ive tried a few different mmos and normally i burn out of them pretty fast tab targetting etc is not very engaging with neverwinter i find the gameplay fun enough that i have managed to level up to sixtyfour quite pleasantly i am a big fan of dungeons and dragons so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous forgotten realms setting the zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and i find the combat fun which is good because almost all quests are of the kill x monsters type i have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called antimicro which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller which it is designed for in any case sixtyfour levels in and ive not spent a penny which is pretty good
early access reviewbeen a backer for a few years now havnt played in a long time logged on recently to see tons of old blocks gone my currency has been jacked up and i can no longer compete becasue my weapons systems are outdated in three days of free premium i got jack the new loot system is horrible and i feel like i have been ripped off they just want your continued premium money and money for stupid loot crates where a rust crate can give better gear than a paid for prothium crate screw this developer they are just leaches at this point
early access reviewthis game is a living testament that the pubg devs are perhaps the most incompetent devs in history within months of developmnet this game has more weapons better graphics and more items than pubg sure its rough and clunky but i was just amazed how much is actually in this game pubg devs just look useless compared to these other battle royale devs popping up there is zero excuse for them not to be dropping biweekly content drops whether its just a new weapon or whatever people deserve more for thirty bucks
exciting fast paced space moba that is third person you control a large ship with a fleshed out crew every ship is pretty well balanaced from what ive seen and most have a high skill cap some ships are simply better than others in one area but might be totally outclassed in another my paragon is effective midclose range but something like the collosus can often times rip me apart at that range knowing the enemys ships are very helpful im still pretty new but this game is probably going to remain in my library for quite some time friendly devs that still work on the game however they dont really say what their patches are and appear silent on steam forums with an active official website forum however i wish people would actually use the chat function more
early access reviewit seems like it could be a quality game but i had a serious problem every button i pressed on my keyboard made me crouch down this was very annoying and i tried many things to help it but it made the game unplayable
plays like garbage pc runs it fine npcs jitter around just stand on top of a car and flashlight them to death didnt bother with pvp could be good not going to waste the time though
sometimes you will be walking down a hall and the hall will gradually get smaller and you will feel fear and it will be a horrific experience before the red man appears once the red man appears the only way to beat the game is to press esc and the down arrow key and enter i won very easily
i played this game quite a bit back in twenty seventeens on the phone i have enough hours for this game to properly review it duel links is meh if youre a fan of yugioh id give it shot the card battles are short and the music voice acting are top notch my issue is that its tedious requiring constant check ups to gain exp and money to buy cards by battling npcs the double edged feature they included was an auto feature that played for you while a cool idea and allows you to quickly take out npcs the game turns into an idle game another card game hearthstone makes you fight npcs and then throws you into the fray against enemy players to gain more exp the reason im bringing this up is because in hearthstone the fights are rewarding when you win against an enemy player i wish there was an option to fight harder npcs from the get go as the ranked play in this game is full of salt most fights have revolved around having certain cards with giant effects i remember one match where the dude already had three monsters out on the second turn and one of them could negate set trap cards and spell cards i could not find the motivation to continue learning about all the cards the game offers this game does have a few interesting mechanics when opening cards you can go through an entire box and get all the cards as long as you dont reset the box if you pay a fixed price you can get all the cards in the box or go at it one pack at a time and still gain the cards i recommend not reseting the box as it will mess up your chances you can also buy prebuilt decks to use the game also has a small pool of cards taken from each gen of yugioh no t like monster reborn or exodia so the developers do consider balance in some way there are multiple characters with different abilities to chose from which allows for a variety of benefits with your characters and cards my issue is that there is too many cards as of writing there are more than ten boxes to go through and all of the cards are usable in ranked play so you do not know what to expect when jumping in a match i also had my account deleted when i had this on my phone i had pegasus and quite a good amount of cards to play with what i liked voice acting music and quick battles what i didnt like auto feature energy system tons of cards no locked meta
good game spend quite some time on it sofar and its enjoyable the quests are mostly normal mmo quests kill ten x get three x etc there are somewhat more story quests which involve some npcs saying things and some cutscenes pros free fun to play all classes offer something unique constanly being developed free expansions as far as i can tell once you hit level sixty a whole new world opens up cons bag spacebank slotscharacter slots all need to be bought without lots of grinding you cant compete at endgame with those that spend real money prices for basic things are a bit high its worth a try if you got time to spare this game can fill it

planetside two on a planet with similar climate properties as earth there are three factions fighting over multiple facilites in territories regions in which they can annex and capture and expand their grasp of the surface area in these four continents that are snow desert forest and swamplike environments the game spans to thousands of people per server resulting in a massive battlefield atmosphere classes fleets of gunships convoys of tanks platoons of troops etc the gameplay itself is solid with bulletdrop on many weapons and movement being comparable yet subpar for example you can scale sides of cliffs of infantry while standing on nothing but thin air but that doesnt bother me at all because doing that gives me an advantage for good sniping spots moving onto the dynamics this game is freetoplay which is great having any one of my friends just hop in and play there are fifteen month memberships and bundles where the per month price decreases the more you subscribe and there is also the daybreak cash premium currency this is mostly useless unless you wish to buy decoratives or armor for your character and new camos but everything else that actually affects gameplay can be acquired by certs ingame credit points for every two hundred and fifty experience you earn for the graphics and optimization of the game the game itself is poorly optimized but if you do run it at highest settings it does look pretty damn good on my gtx four hundred and sixty i ran it at straight up medium settings with about thirtyfive fps but now with a gtx nine hundred and seventy it is absolutely amazing at max now to summarize this game up it is a must download and try out for sure deff the best mmofps ive played and when it was first released in two thousand and twelve i thought it was ahead of its time and in some aspects it still is there may be a feel of repetition and grinding when youre playing by yourself but once you get a great group of friends going youll find yourself putting countless hours into the game
i speant close to half an hour tracking a hog finally found it got my shot lined up clicked and http i imgur comlg2ts2g jpgapparently you have to pay real world money to be able to hunt some of the animals in the game
i start playing because most dfoer moved here but its kind dispointing its visually overdone having hard time to see urself or target during fancy animation especially in big party it should provide wasd setting rather than arrow keys only theres cusomize setting for joystick but not for keyboardthis game is not free to play u need to pay for second skill bar its cheap to buy only 450k ching i thinkbe prepared to pay for the skill bar or just dont waste ur time in this game
i really appreciate that this game is free most of the amazing games ive played are super expensive and the fact that this is free blows my mind it has a lot of features and stuff

early access reviewimagine making your reservation well in advance to the nicest steak restaurant in town when you get there you order the two charcoal grilled grassfed ribeye with a rosemary sprig and melted blue cheese then thirty minutes later the waiter comes out pins your head to the table and takes a giant steaminghot dump in your open mouth before stapling a fifty five bill to your forehead dont buy this
early access reviewa very good alternative to real mtg which takes full advantage of its digital format to do a lot of interesting stuff very gracious f2p model and the paid content is well worth it
"early access reviewif youre browsing in recent reviews dont bother with this game i wont even mention stuff like mana system because some people hate it some people love it rather its a prime example of pay two win model dont trust old reviews saying it isnt it wasnt always like this i have to admit i played it a bit during its early open beta it was harsh but a determined player could eventually afford a deck or two in the days when there was only the base set now theres a basic set and three other sets with 250ish cards each commons and uncommons are easy to get but every pack yields only one rarevery rarely a legendary youll get a few packs at the start and youll get a pack from a latest set as a daily reward but there are lots of cards you will need keep in mind 1k card pool and if you think youll be able to craft legendaries i have some very bad news for you common card dusts for one shard and a legendary costs three thousand, two hundred and you can have up to four copies of them new players may think this game is generous i mean you even get some paltry sum of gold and a common from every bronze chest you open this flood feels like you make a progress but the truth is your progress is equal to the amount of legendaries you own you may ask why do you need legendaries cant you use commons instead well legendaries have one of two things they either have a unique gamewinningtier ability no commons have or theyre just a stats powerhouseor a mix of both to give you an example a common four cost in yellow has stats of thirty four and one minor skill the legendary four cost is fifty six it has one minor skill one unique skill no other common has to sum up you will never catch up to older players who played every day since early beta or donators i have to admit the game mechanics and card variety are pretty decent too bad all you can do is drool at the crafting screen if you have a spare five hundred to throw at the game feel free to try it if not then stay away i hope i will save your time"
early access reviewthis game is amazing i highly recommend it for people who want a good free fps game it is a lot of fun and very addicting i easily nominated this game for the game of the year award the gameplay in this game is a lot like cs go but there is team deathmatch and some other gamemodes like demolition in my opinion this is the best free first person shooter game ever made
early access reviewpersonally i did love the game but they decided to run everyone off by doing the dumbest possible with the latest update for example i now have an assload of credits that cant be spent on anything in the game all of my stats were completely wiped leaving me having to start over stat wise and i think the most change is that you cant complete chalanges without buying a new type of currancy that cant be earned in game leaving you forced to spend money on t just to complete chalanges you tencent you right in the eye with a goddamn chainsaw
nice game it is fun addicted it have crossplatform support thanks steam and open source projects it could have auto movingcruise forwardbackward like in full world of tanks game or war thunder or armored warfare etc it is low on perfomance impact great for mobile chips enjoy
when this first came to ea i thought eh i like this genre so ill give it a try i knew it was aiming to be a f2p game with an online store and that didnt bother me the development was steady but not really all that fast again not an issue but the gamedevs didnt seem to have a set goal in mind like so many games in this genre lately seemed to be more of a lets see what people want inside of minecraft and then try to add that to our game but with less complexity flash forward lot of cosmetics lot of build options but not a lot of complexity sure it comes close but other recent games in this genre come much closer and look better to boot however since it is free go ahead and check it out just try to avoid spending real on it until you determine if you like it or not
so i thought id update my review since things have changed the positives of this game are in no order incredible optimization incredible graphics incredible attention to detail with the vehicle models not damage models though enormous selection of vehicles to playthe downsides are gaijin are complete and basically the dying fetus of the ussr hard to figure out mechanics for a lot of things russian vehicles often have game breaking bugs or problems that benefit them that go without fix for months if it hurts them then patched in a day nonrussian vehicles have a game breaking bug that benefit them for a day before it is completely patched if it doesnt benefit them months on end no fix shells that russian vehicles dont mainly use solid ap apds hesh etc are underperforming and unrealistic smoke launchers dont work but you can use artillery which makes much more smoke as smoke screen atgms completely ruined what little balance there was matchmaker can be stupidly biased with one team stacked with eighty tanks and enemy team have seventy tanks basically a point pinata lots of prototype pay to win vehicles grind is ing ridiculous repair prices are so bad that only the top three people on either team will earn money running good graphics is a disadvantage harder to see enemys in tanks lot of unrealistic maps and unrealistic situations for tanks beta game being used as an excuse for problems when it has content that costs forty ing quid keep adding content without fixing content in game community is full of weebs i mean what the off with your anime fetish underage tank girls this is literally the reason germany started kicking off easy to exploit game problems lack of information in tank rb makes it incredibly tense long winded and really hair raising compression at top tiers is so bad that less people play entry level jets and then gaijin compress it more to lower matchmaker times and then less people play aircraft below that aka gaijin just increase br range and lower rp costs and these problems will sort themselves lots of arcade gamemodes for realistic tanks gaijin claim to have realism and do in a lot of aspects but will ignore the community with overwhelming evidence cough maus 240mm front plate literally measured in real life with a tape measure and gaijin just ing ignored it and left it at 220mm and other times will change things in the name of balance instead of realism lots of german suspension is crap in game but there is a video of a panther rolling over bumps with no problem but in game you break and the entire vehicle wobbles for five seconds before the gun can be line up with the target awful tournaments which nobody played and ended up being money grab getting free content requires grinding off your entire life didnt add ships despite leading the community to believe that they could play proper naval vessels and instead added boats because everyone wants to sail in rubber ing dingys instead of hms warspite british tanks were ing boss and actually competitive when first introduced because of apds whilst it was maybe too powerful all solid rounds across the board were nerfed so that british rounds are now not only laser pointers but cost silly amounts spalling doesnt exist and apparantly a human in a tank is able to completely absorb a five kg round travelling at fourteen hundreds ms able to penetrate 250mm of solid steel at 2km yeh apds has a you hit it you kill it policy with ammoracks so if youre off by 2cm then congrats that ammorack survived and thats 400sl down the drain so to summarize its a good game with good qualities but its a grind and has extensive problems gaijin are so far up their own that they can taste their own tonsils and will never listen to community feedback lest it disadvantage their agenda good luck if you do try it though
early access reviewim not a huge fan of the battle royale genre however i can safely say this is the exception for me i started playing the weekend closed alpha started and i can see how much this game has grown since then as it is now its honestly a fun game to play im sure once it reaches beta or when its fully released it will be so much better
i enjoyed my time playing this it has pretty simple yet fun combat and when you arent exploring the game world you can create your own you get a house you can bring with you to each world like a campsite that you are free to customize to help you out on your adventure which gives you a great chance to show off your building skills to other players this game is definitely worth checking out im a big fan of mmorpgs and while i realize this style is a homage to minecraft this style isnt really seen in an mmo setting very often which makes the game unique since it is trying to make the voxel style appeal to a vastly different market its definitely worth checking this game out
feel like i just time travelled back to two thousand and fives when this game would have been classed as an average mmo that what this game feels like on top of horrendously poorly optimized games make me feel very sad i hate wow with a passion but i think i would prefer to play that than this game
its a game on a computer but theres a twist its a card gamefurthermore its only a god dang card game based upon an actulal computer game but serioulsy its addictive firstoff but also amazingingly frustraing build up mega hand to only be killed by one point card i keep playing it but never want to i hope this helps with your downstairs problems i like it i just dont like small community that play the same game for three years so that to make me go two hundred and ten games wl very much p2w but you can tag along without i still put like
early access reviewits in open beta so understand its still in development however i love this game me and my friends are utterly addicted give it a chance i promise you wont be disappointed artix entertainment the developers are some of the best developers ever and take it upon themselves to interact with their players and update and improve their games weekly
perfect world entertainment presents how to bend dungeons and dragons over a table and pork it up the with a red hot iron pokergouging market pay to win shennanigans t small world and game cryptic seems to have really let pwe all over what could have been great
early access reviewfeels basic and watered down i really like the forge and being able to do something with useless itemsweapons that youd normally leave on the floor but its not enough to make the game too interesting jumping and vaulting also felt supremely clunky if youre not extremely close to the halfwall or window in question youll only do a tiny hop
early access review overall rating seven hundred and ten for being an early access game this is pretty good i spent seventy one hrs playing the game in one whole day and didnt disappoint me at all except for a few minor issues forgiven for being still under development graphicsvisual rating seven hundred and ten pretty amazing and visual effects are stunning overall the graphics are good but it needs improvement as it causes major fps drops even on capable pcs also needs more resolution gameplay rating six hundred and ten simple casual fun teamwork is essential core gameplay is solid and pretty balanced so far for an early access although it needs backstory to make the game more interesting do you recommend this game as of now yes this may change depending on how the game turns out after early access development if you somehow feel the urge to comment about my review please do
early access reviewthe graphics are okay but the controls i think are not so good the fact that you need to hold down the mouse button to look is a burden the attack buttons should be assained to keys there should be keybinding for pc users there were instances where i was clicking on a enemy and my character was into a flipping frenzy it should be hack and slash not point and engage graphics are great though and humour is nice i think keybinding and voice chat are two things i will suggest and ditch the mouse hold and look design and just give it the hack and slash design a thirty five for me but will recommend as some might like it others may be dissapointed a little
dont download and play it ive played many hours of the infestation survivor stories classic and helped the developers backing it early when i bought three copies of the game two for friends im totally disappointed to buy a game from these developers they did so many mistakes and promises that has never been accomplished then ive downloaded this free to play version to give it a chance but is the same old game but now for free it was a waste of time downloading think twice before buy a game from op productions llc
early access reviewplease dont even consider this game as game its really not they failed everywhere with this garbage they brought it to us with improvement new combat and a lot more new quot but when early access came nothing they promised was there they said something like it was phase for development but that should be said before not when customer pays you already for something you cant provide after all of this t so many players left and refundend i stayed cuz i believed that they can impove it so i gave them another chance believe me worst idea ever they didnt improve nothing and after some time they made game cheaper for a little while and now they announced that early access was success and game will go f2p for real this my worst spent money ever never want to hear anything about neowiz company or people in charge of this crap thank you for reading and please dont do same mistake like many of us
early access reviewinteresting game combat is solid looks pretty would want to see some examples of different areans before buying not sure it will have much stiking appeal in its current state having to spend more money on better ships ala free to play is a big turn off a tentitive recomendation
early access reviewive been playing this game for a long time but unfortunately as time pass by the game just gets more worse now the game is pay to win also they have removed a lot of interesting stuffs like robo tiers tech tree rp and more stuffs to list dont bother paying for anything either
if you didnt start the game when it came out youre screwed any players joining either get disconnected from server or if youre completely new to the game you get killed by another player within ten seconds of spawning half hour twelve deaths later not a single life lasted longer than one thousand and fifteen seconds ill try playing another time when the game is a little better balanced for new players
early access reviewi absolutely love the game i dont know why so many of you are complaining i think the majority of you are just jumping on the bandwagon like s to hate on this game just because this isnt their first time of release i had no connection issues whatsoever or other issues the only thing that bothered me was the fps which i believe will be fixed by the devs even so having four thousand and sixty fps isnt a huge problem for playing a mmorpg game its not a competitive shooter like cs go lol you either have a pc or a network dont blame the devs my wifi is but the game runs just fine on na servers keep in mind that i am living in korea off the bandwagon losers
product received for freeearly access revieweternal is a really fun game overall easy to learn and has a toooon of lore now despite my thumbs up review there are a few glaring errors that prevent me from giving this a whole five stars some people on here complaining about the prologuetutorial i honesty blew through it and you can skip cutscenes shouldnt take too longalso personally i enjoy larger decks tesl allows for one hundred cards i think it adds a lot of depth and randomness to your battlespros plays similarly to magic tg and hearthstone tons of interesting lore with a fun backstory cutscenes can be skipped fun and enjoyable artwork on the cards a ton of game modes gauntlet mode is free larger decks with tooons of card type variety free thirty packs with twitch primecons forge mode costs crystals which you can get by winning online pvp or you guessed it microtransactions i dontt mind microtransactions but the only way to obtain crystals are through those methods pvp servers are close to dead it takes longer and longer each match to connect with another player and when you do eventually get matched up they give you someone who is well above your tier i love a challenge but i was up against a three tier silver as a three tier bronze additonal campaign modes can only be purchased through crystals and what moneyplease read very importantif you are to get anything out of this review be advised that there has to be something done about the inconsistent drawing of sigil cards they literally will cost you a game for example in one match every draw for five consecutive draws were sigils my opponent had a loaded field of creatures and i cannot defend or summon without creatures the reverse is also true i had one game where i barely drew any sigils causing my opponent to have thirteen mana and me to have six yes six i get that there has to be some strategy involved but this is just rediculoous i have upgraded my decks to the maximum capacity and still it seems off to me how are you supposed to defendattack with strategy with zero influence if i have zero cards in my deck and my opponent has thirty four creatures guess what ill draw three conwecutive sigils its unfair and you cant really preapre for something thats designed to screw with you its flipflopped every other gamehearthstone tesl and mtg have this down to a science each turn you get manamagickawhatever makes it fair follow their lead thats about it overall really fun and tons of game modes however there are some rough patches
access reviewi am really surprised about this the idea of fits really well into the game movement and weapon mechanics feel good not as arcade as cod but still no arma realism a bit faster game play than pubglong term motivation might lack a bit but i hope the will come up with new maps speaking about maps the current map is done pretty well far more details than pubg and therefore a more interesting environment
sakura clicker is a game where you click on the screen to reduce the life of a monster an anime girl dressed up as something until you defeat it it is replaced by another creature and you repeat the process gaining gold to buy allies who help deal damage to the monsters its an infinite cycle of the same thing the game even plays for you so you can accumulate gold even when you are not playing i kept playing wondering if there was anything else to it but there really isnt if you are into this kind of game maybe an appropriate game for cell phones good for you however most people will probably not find any joy in playing this

early access reviewim a veteran magic the gathering player who has played hearthstone since it was in beta and im switching to eternal that should be all you need to know join us
still the same old hackfest it ever was the later you stay on more hackers arrive they will never get banned it sure is fun though i like playing it its a shame they still cant figure out that the hackers have always been what holds this game back
early access reviewthe ships are awesome and have the feeling of being huge juggerauts without beeling sluggish the designs are original and very unique the gameplay is action packed and tactical this game will be something big one day im sure of it
after six hundred hours of gameplay with path of exile i still recommend this game to anyone who wants to start out the arpg genre completly free and yes still better than the new released diablo game immortal hehe
a p2w mmorpg i tried it and has most stuff other mmorpgs has special powerful stuff in a store with microtransactions a farm and many quests so far i only figured out to get one dragon and it is only teenager still i cannot even seem to chat in the game this game seems quite buggy for a mmorpg
early access reviewthis game is good there are hackers yes but in a game like this it doesnt bug me as much as a game like csgo or codsome guns need work shotguns need more damage six shots to chest to kill one person p as well as some of the assault rifles snipers are pretty balanced without armor is one shot with armor two shot unless headshot then always one shotthe graphics are good for a f2p gameits not p2w holy a f2p game with no p2w you can buy skins but they are just skins710 will make eight or nine hundred and ten if the guns are fixed and some form of anticheat is added
this game is great but played it on my mobile for a year unfortunatly the information isnt transferable which is plain stupid so thats a vault completly full and micro transaction wasted playing again you can find it boring waiting for something to do
this game is so cp you firstly have to create another account aside from your steam one them once you start the grapichs are aweful and then you have to pay real money to get more races and cars
ive been playing this game for over two years now and have watched it go from prealpha to alpha to beta and if the developers keep the pace they have set with all of their updates and patches i have no doubt this will be one of the top independent online multiplayer games ever this game is consistently fun and intense enough to alway keep you on the edge of your seat while the game may seem like it is pay to win i do not think it will be like that once the game is officially released i just think it looks that way because the developers are just trying to get the funds to keep the level of quality they have established going
pros nice graphics only fire isnt that good superb sound especially the sound of the jetengines sounds pretty realistic realisitc gameplay yeah its not the reality but its more realistic than for example wot diffrent gamemodes allinone game no extrodownload to play ships for examplecons sometimes the balance happens when new vehicles are introduced but will be worked on long grind effects doesnt look good the mentioned above fire
early access reviewsorta like if magic hearthstone had a baby f2p has been very generous its too hard to catchup to hearth and magic without a large investment now whereas feels like you can get in at the ground level on this now and wont have as hard a time collecting all the cards you need to create interesting decks
no like honestly this game puts kanye wests face to shame it made justin cry his singing career off and my grandmothers porridge puked from seeing it im just horrifi like no im done screw this there was even a man named black jesus im done
early access reviewso when you hit softcap there will be no promosing content no arenas or battlegroundsno pvp ranking system or ranking rewardshonor point acquisition is brokenbasel canyon main pvp map is empty no mobsslevels for unlocking last two stances and trait points are not implemented cant progress past 45skill gem acquisition is brokenno migra turris hard mode or whatever name they gave it in our versiontwo end game dungeons with exactly same gear score dropsno royal questno honor questno daily dungeon
early access reviewthis is one of the best games ive played on steam i love the specialties with the different classes and how diverse each match is you never know what to expect ive played a few matches i won once and it is very satasfying totally recommend
i have played this game for around two months now and have thoroughly enjoyed it it can be a bit of a grind at times but what f2p game isnt it seems to be a much fairer and overall better version of hearthstone which i also spent many months playing you get good value from the arena the story mode is something special which i dont see in many other card games and the rune system makes it possible to win even when behind if you get some prophecys overall would rate it a solid nine hundred and ten
this game has its good fair ok ups and dows prossimple graphicsconshorrible randerquite laggy at sometimes60fps cap no storystupid dlcsbroken spawns sometimes you will fall through the void and lose your stuff when you load up a worldthis game is just like mw2 has no protection from hackkersbroken npc that can hit you through the walls so i say this game is a six hundred and ten and i give it this raiting because there needs to be more added like protecting to the game and lots of bug fixes devs if you are reading this please listen to me and addfix these things thanks for reading
i have been around since beta and plays on multible platforms i have 1000s off hours made into this life elder scrolls legends are like weed you cant get enough once you get into esl heartstone will never be the same again delete delete esl is the card game made right only rng you find in this game is from the chaos arena the gold limit is so much off work thirty wins and a single match can last up to thirty minutes with a solid deck so you are lucky to get to the limit and receive the persistent title no money needed to win personaly i am soon eighty nine to complete my card collection with no real money used but i think the systemrequirements are misleading coz you rly need a brain to win in the long run may you walk on warm sands and may the fates smile on khajiit
early access reviewmost people when posting reviews rant on about how its good and bad im just going to say you need a beastly computer to run this game but its totaly worth it
i decided to ignore everything that went on with this game so far and give it a shot heres a description of my twenty minutes in more or less game1 the game opened in three windows and crashed2 started the game again created character played the tutorial character got frozen fighting a dummy restarded the game3 got through the tutorial quest npc didnt spawn restarted the game4 game loaded npc spawned mouse coursor did not restarted5 game loaded npc spawned mouse coursor loaded got quest entered cinematic game crashed6 unistalled during the rare ocassions when everything worked the game was extremelly laggy and controls absolutely unresponsive just save yourself the trouble
early access reviewhow the hell is the reviews mixed this game is trash complete trash paying money for this is the worst mistake i have ever made do not buy this garbage game
trove is a great game it has a bit of stuff for nearly everyone from gardening to ringcrafting to leveling up trove also has many mounts pets a few boats and sails and mag riders it also comes with many biomes and classes in my opinion trove is a great rpg but thats just my opinion
so i am asuming youre one of those people that saw this game and thought oh that looks cool to play with friends and have a bit of funwell if you are one of those people stop stop thinking that right now if you honestly like this game and have played it before and can handle the terrible controls and stupid commentary and foolish music choice then congrats you are the spawn of satan and everything unholy but if you are a first timer and have never played this before thinking it looked fun well its not its a big pile of steaming crap sat on your doorstep ready for you to unknowingly stand on it when you step outside your door then the smell just lingers like a virus and honestly you regret all the decisions you have made in your life and want to go back to the womb and start over310 the three is only there to make the creators feel good about themselves in some sort of way
it great game everyone should play even though what u level you will get better weapon and go to new world that are avalible so i great game and i hope developers make a good game like this d
received for freeearly access reviewthe amount of data collection in their privacy policy is beyond egregious now i see why this game is free this is just another example about tech companies trying to profit by taking advantage of their users and they should be ashamed i understand desiring to use products in some cases despite overreach of the company in question but we as users cannot tolerate and support behavior like this if you value your own privacy or anyone elses
early access reviewfokin uslesysa geim in da waerld is bery stuipieydno seriously this game is trashso you know what you should do rate it as bad and delete it and you could also write a review like this one
early access reviewi tried to like this game i tried so hard to like this game but i cant think of it like this its planetside two but in a wwii setting so if you hated pl2 youll hate this game as soon as you hit rank three with any faction you get completely ed by the game matchmaking suddenly becomes a broken mess people are oneshoting you from across the map with tanks you get bombed on by planes who fly so close to the ground in reality the bomb should have blown them up as well you cant do because your being spawncamped you shoot a guy three times in the torso with a semiautomatic rifle only for him to oneshot you with a bolt action ect ect as soon as i hit rank three i was like alright i can drive tanks i can do assault maps yesi was playing as an american soldier and the first tank they give dosent even have a ing cannon on it no it has two useless mgs on it that cant do to other tanks why the would you give us a tank that you cant even fight other tanks with it whats the ing point of a tank if it doesnt have a cannon on it it might as well be a slow jeep with two mgs on it at that rate not to mention that each mg can only move one hundred and eighty degrees so to aim at someone to your right you gota either hope you have a gunner with who or you gotta turn the clunky piece of around and by that point your blown up did i mention matchmaking holy it gets so broken when any faction gets to rank three tired of being an american soildier whos rank five go switch to your german soilder whos rank one whoops put you in a game with a bunch of rank 815s have fun i should probably mention you have to rank each faction individually but for some stupid ing reason as soon as one faction reaches rank three the other two factions get the benefits of hitting rank three even though they could both be untouched because everyone ranks on their own you have to deal with the starting equipment and ribons and medals all over again with each faction only adding to the grind this game presents this may be because im not a patient person to begin with but this game is so ing broken due to its matchmaking and utter grindyness for each faction that i cant recomend this to anyone unless you played this when it first came out and youre all geared up and whatever get ready for this game to shove a ten foot pole up your and then shove a twenty foot pole into your while the ten foot pole is still in there

early access reviewfun game i have a day played twentyfour hours its a grind to be able to get the best gear but when u get the best armor and wepons it is so worth it zero recomended for a good player decent computer needed
early access reviewi may not have played a large amount of the game but i feel ive played enough to give an educated opinion i tried the game in hope of finding a sort of ww2 themed battlefield game as it promised large scale vehicular combat i was then saddened when i realized that the only combat i would be seeing is tiny skirmish battles with civilian trucks in place of the large panzer tanks id hoped for but before even reaching combat i had to tackle the loadout menus which are utterly confusing and drastically over complicated and lets not forget the propaganda for buying premium currency eventually i gave in and began to enter the skirmish battles with my new us character this i regret i took up position behind a rock and began firing away at the greygreen enemies against the greygreen backdrop i stared down the useless iron sights which obstructed my view more than aided it and fired a round at an enemy that was closing in hit however i was utterly flabbergasted when the enemy retorted with a barrage of bullets from their machine gun i was chopped down in a matter of seconds questioning how i could fight these bullet spewing monsters i continued the cycle spawning firing a measly few bullets before being destroyed by those blasted machine guns the battle then boiled down to a relentless spawn killing and needless to say i was on the receiving end frustrated by my beating i navigated myself to the shop in search of my own machine gun i then had to pick my jaw up from the floor once i saw its price tag but rest assured you could easily purchase it with some premium currency against my instincts i grinded enough money to buy another american rifle this one a bolt action as i wished to begin sniping if the starting rifle was bad then this one must have been the worst it traded the semiautomatic fire rate of the starting rifle for a measly damage increase and even worse iron sights meanwhile id also unlocked the ability to finally engage in the actual battles the game advertises it was nothing like what id hoped instead of being able to partake in ordered offensive and defensive battles i was greeted with the barrel of some highrank tank controlled by a guy ten times my level and to make matters worse if i dodged the tanks then i would surely have my brain splattered by some grey blur of a sniper on a hill at the other end of the base and this is where i uninstall this game to summarise the games concept is brilliant however it is delivered so poorly i wish id never been tempted into downloading i appreciate that the game is free however it is heavily unbalanced and easy to skip to the top of the leaderboard if youve got the dough for it oh and also the vehicle controls are so clunky and unresponsive you could brew a cup of tea by the time your bicycle makes a right turn that is unless you arent blasted apart by any of the methods listed above i would recommend this game to nobody other than those who prefer to buy prestige rather than earn it maybe you will squeeze some fun out of this game but i for one will enjoy all the saved storage base this game once occupied
early access reviewthe graphics are really dope and well optimized the gameplay is clunky and the menusettings are lacking but thats to be expected of ea strange humorous theme of men in their underwear with cooking utensils for armor and ww2 guns kind of bizarre imo but okay why i disliked the game game launches in a seperate application when the match starts so thats three apps a launcher a menu and the actual game running do the devs not know how to put together a game next the client runs in the background it launches when you start up your pc so i assume it installed some unwanted registry key that i didnt give any consent to finally my desktop completely froze up when i switched windows to start up a recording the cursor was locked in place so i couldnt do anything and alttabbing caused the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen forcing me to reboot no thanks dont want to deal with that again especially since i was in the middle of backing up data when it happened
early access reviewthis game runs and play well from the little amount i have played it is incredibly enjoyable far more enjoyable than pubg but sadly the good comes with the bad if you run this game in an account that is not administrator you will likely run into issues with steam api failed error message upon boot up
early access reviewthis is like a terrible version of call of duty now ive never played call of duty myself but let me tell u something i have a friend from my church that playys the game regularly and he is pretty good at it and i had him play this with me he said it was the worst piece of he has ever seen i agree with him not only is this game not worth the web page its printed on the prices r way too high the gun r very inaccurate the hitboxes r and the fps is horrenous never in my life have ive seen such a bad excuse for not only a game but something that in its review said it was suppost to be better than call of duty and battlefield well let me tell u something whoever it is that created this game get a real life u absoultly suck at war game and would better off going back to your worthless mom and breastfed a little longer you ing worthless piece of
as you can tell from my hours i have played this game quite a bit im gonna go for an unbiased review of this but it may end up being a tad bit biased without me realizing it without further ado im gonna just jump right in pros one fun but occasionally repetitive gameplay two decent graphics and visual effects three really nice character design and backstories four great diversity in combat styles for certain characterscons one slightly p2w two certain overpowered classes looking at you cra and die three terrible economy four moderately buggy at times five the majority of the pvp community is bad this one is a bit of a gripe but it still remains truethese sum up most of the major points but there is a lot more to go in detail about first things first if you wanna play this game seriously its pretty much unavoidable to not spend money at some point it wont be too much but the major thing thats locked behind a paywall is the skill slot change medal when you start out you only have four skill slots and getting that medal unlocks the other four its nine worth of kching to buy it and even though you wont need it for some the majority of classes benefit greatly from it with some needing it as a necessity there are some events that will give you a free permanent medal but those dont happen too often so you would probably end up waiting several months for one of those events besides that theres nothing else you need to spend money on although its pretty obvious they made the skill quests extremely grindy to push you towards just buying the skill you need instead of doing the respective quests for it the quest for most second job changes takes quite a bit as well taking as long as a couple of weeks for people who play casually note this does not include all second job changes quests as for the rest of the game even though there are some negatives the gameplay makes it worth it its really fun to play and even though theres a pretty sharp learning curve that happens around level forty six thats what makes it fun even replaying through the various areas as different characters levelling them up can prove a completely different experience depending on which classes youve played already graphics 8soundtrack 75gameplay 95bugs 7overall 8verdict even though there are some definitely noticeable flaws the p2w factor isnt too high and its worth at least a shot in my eyes
early access reviewok so the title doesnt make a lick of sense not really and its basically a carbon copy of pubg but its got snowboarding and nifty graphics that arent too animeish for what should be a generic cashgrab chinese battle royale clone the weather and mobility twist makes it actually insanely fun plus rendering is fantastic if youre good enough you can snipe someone clear across the map with the right vantage point the helicopter thing for four people is pretty pointless because everyone just camps the helicopter and spams medpacks so its still basically last man standing other than that this is a good pubg knockoff that i find myself playing more than pubg itself heres to a good game before the inevitable pay to win cash shop that i just feel will eventually show up one day
a very solid eight hundred and ten would give it one thousand and ten but i just thing there is much more the could be done like making small towns with npcs and mabye some will have a litlle quest like bring me this and you will get this in return but overall very good game
god damn this game the game is just not worth its time there is no fairness in this game the chances of landing on the aspects you want are super slim therefore the other team always lands on the thought you dont want this needs to be changed there needs to be better probabilities in this game sorry but its not worth your time playing this game i like the aspect of the game and concept the other side takes over thank you for reading this feedback hopefully no one takes it personnally
this is getting annoying i really would like to play this game because i know a few people who have recommended it however whenever i try downloading the game it will install download the game package as if it was about to start and then crash my computer smh ive tried this four times now off the website and steam download what i s t h e problem
early access reviewi think the spookiest thing about the game is the pants allconsuming anxiety and stress that comes with encountering and trying to escape from a monster by the time i got to the last rooms seven hundred i was a deadeyed hollowedout shell of my former self sprinting through rooms and barely registering when something was chasing me1010 would play again
early access reviewits a great game for only being in its alpha stage to those of you who are complaining about having to wait five minutes for something to be mined wdf doods this game takes hardly any time compared to many other games that make you wait hours or even days for items to be crafted this is a fantastic game and has much more working content than i expected for a game in alpha fanstastic so far and keep up the good work devs
this game is not free to play its just a highly restricted and limited demo version and should not be allowed to be sold under the argument of free to play the content you can enjoy without a subscribtion is maybe five of the game100 a no
how to get your life back go to help click on steam support go to recent products click on sakura clicker click on permanently remove game from my account warning the game still shows up under recent on your profile so you might want to binge play some games to hide this at the bottom of the recent list
simply put everyones right the game is you get like1 car and one map for free controls are attrocious and you will find yourself crashing often f2p p2w free to play pay to win though i dont know how anyone can win with controls like these get this crap off my library
early access revieweveryone can enjoy this gameit doesnt take much to get used to it and play decently wellenjoy the grinds and the fun battle matches oh and its not p2w but skins do look damn good haha
the game trys to keep you playing by making one of the guns available to buy with the currency you earn from completing missions when in reality there are not enough missions to be able to get enough currency to buy the gun if youre wondering why i wouldnt just use another gun it is because you have to use the gun to tag rabbits
"updated two hundred and forty one thousand, one hundred and eighteen its been a while and rc is still utter that sums it up if youre an old robocraft two thousand and fifteen fan for the love of god stay away from this game dont be fooled by recent reviews saying the tech tree is back etc its hardly like the older one the equivalent to t10 games are nothing like what they used to be tdm is a respawn fest with everything dumbed down and sped up theres no teamplay whatsover because respawns and self healing are a thing so medics are completely redundant absolute waste of your time if you decide is try this againolder review ask me for a review on this before respawned and overclocked update three hundred thousand, four hundred and fifteen i would give this a positive review but after resspawned and overclocked update thats a whole new side heres whybefore respawned and overclocked this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode once dead youre gone once they introduced medics it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together moreover when fj released the team balance patch the battles would last sooooo much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldnt be paired with five other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of smg tanks as medic you would feel so valuable one of my favourite memories megabots arrive some of the player base decides this was a bad move this was where the game started to get controversial however in my opinion this was even better because now the t10s would stick by the megas siding them in one big turf war those were the good days of rc30th of april arrives respawned and overclocked the danger of dying now gone stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using tri forcing ect team work is gone no need to stick together if you die you can just respawn again dont even get me started on medics before respawned and overclocked medics were the top priority on kill list but now theyre just replaced with respawn again no fear of dying megabots are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new respawned and overclocked the megabots were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned even though arena mode is still here it feels as if it gets no love anymore robocraft unleashed touches down the removals of tiers and tech trees are here this resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that its no longer the case in addition going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression i can see fj wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just wont work to some uprobocraft used to be one of my favourite games and was a fun and enjoyable game simple and easy to learn however as the updates passed robocraft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed moba style game ps if you read all of this thanks for your time"
survival mode is the only setting the game was ment to be played at yet major flaws exsist that greatly hinder the players progress even if you bought ingame items to help the disasters spread too fast i had a fire start in an empty room but with a dweller on the other side of the freakin bulkhead say five steps yet it took less then two seconds for the fire to cover three rooms this is because they want you to pay for toonsitems that specifically deal with the flaws they purposefully throw in the game secnd problem is the horrific u i where do i start you cant tell if a female is preggo because the level up icon takes up all the room moving dwellers from one room to another is pain staking the outlined box you hover the dweller over is way to small and out of place completely when viewing from a slightly higher or lower perspective this is also true for when you need to view a dwellers stats but dont want to level him or her up even clicking below their torso still triggers a level up the dwellers will stack on one another to fight making it impossible to check their condition most the pets suck mr handy will move in front of your toons you cant be away from the game if you send your dwellers out for more then 24hrs endurance is useless the difficulty stops increasing around population of forty five deathclaws are not as bad as fires believe it or notive also played this on my phone samsung galaxy seven nine i forget but it runs like molasse after one hundred and twenty people god help you if you spent cash on this trash me included heh just the starter pack youve tricked me this time bethesda five hundred and ten stars i still havent touched your mmo though hah
you can have a panther tank yayyou can shoot at planes with your panther tank yayyou shoot them with your panther tank and at best they start smoking yaythey bomb you once and you are dead yaythe enemy pilots can be fast as sloths and still destroy uranus yayhave fun
early access reviewthis ccg is similar to hearthstone in the collecting aspect but similar to mtg in the combat aspect it isnt a one sided snorefest with no interaction its got interaction on both turns a growing card and player base and some of the most generous reward structures in the ccg industry the tutorial is a little over an hour total played time but it gives decent rewards forty five hearthstone two hundred and fifty five mtgo thirty five
wow alright so all in all a horrible experience first off i try and quit a server and get a disconnecting soon while waiting for over ten minutes get killed it has happened twice now and lost a couple of decent skins because of it
"in short the games matchmaker is very unbalanced to put it in perspective most of the matches i have played i took my tank that was developed at the end of ww2 one hundred and ninety four thousand, four hundred and forty five out in a match and was put up against cold war tanks also getting new vehicles without premium and in some cases with premium takes an ungodly amount of time the only way to effectively grind out a new tank is to purchase a premium account and play a premium vehicle of the higher tier if you dont spend money youre ten steps behind everyone that does"
this game is increadibly p2p the free version is more like a demo to get you into the game this is one of my favorite games play the toutorials and maybe even play with your freinds and you will know if this game is right for you this game is worth every single penny in my opinion p s quick download what do you have to lose
early access reviewfirst off i would like to say that this game has among the best community of players i have ever encountered online everyone is super helpful and nice very collaborative and community oriented lets keep this trend goingnow this is a sandbox gamei am absolutely loving this game its addicing and rewarding everything about this game is fun to do a breif overview of the game you start off in a random location on the world map which currently there are only four variants off which is unfortunate but hopefully soon they will be procedurally generated you have a twig with which to hit things to kill them and harvest their loot and a basic mining coregauntlet you go kill piglets boars leafis things of that nature to collect hide tusks sinew bone etc as you travel you can collect the trees dirt water honey etc in order to upgrade your mining core build up your core mine around explore fight things collect flowersmushrooms make a forge and processor create armor and weapons other neat things furniture what have you mining ore in this game is different instead of clicking on it and standing there until you pop it you place an extractor on the ore node which will harvest it for you giving you time to go and look around for more ore while it processes come back and poof theres twelve coal ore or obsidian or what ever it might be its a very interesting take on it and its a lot of fun well anyway im rambling on about nothing but its a lot of fun and its still in early access tons of fun and immense potentil overall rating810 oh also if you are crying about the game having a price tag now get over it grow up get a job its twenty bucks thats like what less than two hours of work i see so many people complaining about how they ruined the game and made it pay to win it isnt you can either a pay nothing and expierence one hundred of the game or b pay the nominal one time fee of twenty bucks and get a bunch of goodies and be able to create multiple worlds and also help fund the dev team for more updates in the future stop being so entitled to free stuff this real life money doesnt grow on trees nothings ever free
early access reviewi avoided this game people kept telling me to get it and i wouldnt as the pictures looked crap and it looked like minecraft someone wanted me to record with them so i got the game and i can say that i really really love this game it can be so addictive but all depends on if you sort of like things like this i am not that keen on minecraft which this game is very much like but i have to say its so much better than minecraft and there is so much to do you dont just craft something and that is it you find something to craft but before you learn how to craft that item you have to find items for the recipe but some of the items you need you have to learn to craft them aswell very complicated to explain in writing than it is in the game lol but it goes in a circle so much more to it wonderful graphics creatures are amazing you can tame them and then use them for certain items you can spend hours and hours on this learning all the items to craft building a base taming searching for different biomes this game could be so much more popular if it came onto xbox or ps4 and i could see it being on ipads it would appeal to young and old you wont know if you will like it until you get this game
while i greatly enjoy playing the game i cant recommend the game for anyone who either has an addicting personality or doesnt have the funds to regularly drop a couple one hundred on the game yes while you do get the ocassional free gem its nowhere near enough to sustain being free to play the meta changes rapidly and if you want to keep up youre gonne either have to open up your wallet or prepare to be destroyed in pvp matches vs players that have decided to spend the money the gameplay is great and the skills are a fun twist to the game but sadly this is yet another game that was done in by konamis seemingly endless greed
early access reviewawesome game basically magic the gathering through and through but without the ui issues that magic duels has also way better than hearthstone and im probably the biggest blizzard fangirl in the world one thousand and ten
early access reviewdont even bother with this hot garbage years of anticipation and the best artix entertainment can offer us is a crappy mobage which just happens to be playable on pc sound is sorely lacking there are no noises for navigation through menues the launcher is entirely silent and bland 20second soundtracks play once when entering into areas not the tutorial level though which is about as silent as the forementioned launcher crappy fullscreen functionality image is always rescaled interior resolution of ingame resources seem to be inconsistent and i havent been able to get a nonstretched loading screen utilises a premium currency system as the rest of their games have im impressed they had the tenacity to come up with this kind of stuff since before the release of the iphone minimum expenditure of five with crappy starter items right out of the first real area of the game being sold at a value of around two of those five dollars gameplay is absolutely shallow victory is only determined by your level and how many of those 50cent potions you happen to have on hand camera is hard to manipulate it snaps to the direction the character is facing during movement and appears to be optimised for touchscreen interfaces ugly ui need a loading screen to talk to npcs thatll fail a decent amount of the timei didnt play this for long so theres no telling how many other things ive missed
early access reviewthe last update just made the game so bad because those reasons 1money has no value anymore2 the game now its about your luck if you were lucky you get legendry3 the lucky players can get more legendery weapons because they always win and top score so they keep get the best4 the new players can reach high lvl fast if they are luckyplease make the game what it was before
it was such a fun game early on i had an issue when i paid for an alpha game and then it went f2p didnt play for quite a while i went back today and the player base is gone sad because it looks like the new coop missions look awesome but didnt have the patience to wait for a game that long its free so go ahead and try it maybe certain days have more players it really was fun i had way more than ninety eight hours that must be after launch
early access reviewreally great game from the limited amount of time i played ofcourse its similar to minecraft isnt that the point why have only one minecraft when you can have a hundred varieties and choose the you like best its like cheese you might not like blue cheese but love gouda youre still eating cheese and both are one hundred viable pros textures are greatmodels are cutecrafting system easy but funthe sky looks awesomecons i had some laggy movementif youre skeptic about this game give it a go even if you wait til its f2p for some of us its definitely worth it
early access reviewloved adventure quest worldsit basically got a huge upgrade1010 if you play aqw and want something with bit of a change of pace while keeping true to the game this is the game to play
ive sunk a bit over four hundred into the game help edit game now includes essentially malware eac if you are concerned about your privacy dont play this eac does not actually do anything it is easily bypassed and it just bans normal players because their drivers look a little strange look at for honor
"well this game used to be very fun and very interesting however the recent changes to the economy including the tierresearch revamp have caused the people i play with and myself to stagnate horribly now i feel like i am not getting any closer to a hightier fighter that is because i am not on average i have received about five hundred points towards a new plane which costs about one hundred and twenty thousand thats about half a percentage granted before the xp system was flawed similarly but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up and there were times when i got one billion, twenty thousand xp so now i have to play approximately four times as many games to unlock just one plane not to mention i then have to pay for it with lions the games currency so while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same more or less after about tier three the game becomes an unbearable grind so if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours feel free and obviously there are casual options however i would suggest purchasing premiumeagles or waiting until they fix the economy"
games not balanced nor historically balanced so why go a unhistoric unbalanced path community is awfulcommunity manager falsely advertises packs with bad wording and contacting support does nothing but will forward message to devs its been almost a year now and nothing heard back feel scammedeither bad net code or majority of the servers being in eu or ru allows for hit shots to not really hitgame is very grindy unless you buy a t4 premium vehicle premium i said forget it for tanksthe game has a lot of potential but theirs too many glaring issues such as balance to make it worth the time to play majority of new players wont see it untill they get a lot of hours in and i dont blame them i thought the game was amazing at first too this was years ago
dont let the steam hours decieve you i have played over 4k hours of this gamei started playing poe on the ninth of february two thousand and twelve at that time the game was in closed beta it was hard to get a key to get in ive been playing the game on and off ever since first id like to start with some pros and cons unlimited replayability insanely fun difficult to master very good economy system it pays off to play with friends well made desync starts off slow if youre a beginner the game is very big it consists of three acts featuring three difficulties plus an endgame map system with a level cap of one hundred it even comes with races and recently theyve included special leagues with special formats and gimmicks that the normal standard and hardcore versions dont have the game features one of if not the biggest passivetree in all of videogaming it is a very big thing its what makes path of exile what it is all of the different combinations of skills and passives you can do is endless you will never do every single combination skills arent granted through the tree skills are given to you using different gems which are given to you through completing the games storyline and finding them by killing things the economy system of poe is very interesting it consists of orbs that you will find while killing things these orbs are the currency for a list of all the currency click herewww pathofexile com using these orbs you can trade for different items with other players aswell as with npcs inside of the towns or your own hideoutwell how does ggg make money of this game ggg makes money by their fantastic microtransaction model it is all cosmetics with some convinence items stash expansions these are a great way of supporting the game if you dislike the cosmetics the game is hard its not easy to play and its definetly not easy to adapt to the desyncs and such you will your first character up i recommend visiting the poe forums at first and finding a build labeled cheap and then following that for your first character playing with friends definetly pays off as it makes the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally makes the leveling phase alot more enjoyable the game even gives you a fifty increased drops per person in your party overall the game is alot of fun with very few flaws biggest one being the desync but if you enjoy playing arpgs or if you disliked d3 this game is definetly worth trying out and if you never have played before dont play on standard its practicly the dumpster of all leagues
early access reviewthis was a great game until the loot system was introduced why for one they took away the level lock system which made everything fair now some level one can get an incredibly over powered weapon but still be matched with bots around his cpu secondly there is no more economy to this game the idea was completely scraped the economy made it fun because i could buy whatever part i needed to make my dream bot come to life now its hoping i will get a decent part that i can actually use on my bot thirdly the premium system doesnt work well with this update theres not much there to pull you into buying it i either miss four extra parts from ba or one extra part from deathmatch these are just my opinions but they truly did ruin a great game and a lot of my friends have stopped playing update i know alot of popular games like lol and such are adding crates or similar mechanics to the game but if youve actually noticed they havent thrown their whole economy done the drain the crate mechanic is a seperate feature that player can do if they desire to also it wouldnt be that hard to bring back that good old leveling scheme and still having a crate mechanic all you would have to do is literally just limit what the lower levels can get it really isnt that hard to do im really just sick and tired of seeing low levels being able to twoshot eachother it takes away all the fun
warning long post incoming first of all in game description they say thousands of players in my opinion there are about twentyfive hundreds players active in every thirty five battles you start noticing the same names in the list when i started playing the game there was player counter showing 13k15k online players as soon as there was eight thousands and lower developers removed the counter i wonder why i have played the game over several years about fourteen hundreds hours in steam and even before it came to steam i have seen many updates many hotfixes and nerfs i can say that this game is dyingdevelopers are not listening the community developers dont really know what they are doing best example creating tons of skins over fifteen years and yet not a single new assault map developers are allied biased usa su and taking things personally when someone is adressing questions about german faction nazis and the biggest fkup is the one hundred and twelve update the developers rushed in unfinished unpolished unreal the last update is the reason for this review till this point i hoped that game is getting better but i was mistaken only reason why this game is still alive is because its free developers fix your game and listen players who have at least one thousands hours of gameplay in their account

nothing fun in this game anymore between the tryhards and hackers just remeber days just could get on pub server and just have some fun now of days is just stress to keep up with all this tryhards is sad cause game itself is fun it has good environment with colorfull characters but all this for nothing as player base get more and more fouch on compative play and this onces play ground have become serious sport as it is i cant recomand this game any players just wise have fun cause just get beaten up by players take this game way to seriously i probly come back onecs and while play but not cause reason i enjoy myself but the mamoris i have get me coming back to it when this game was bit more for me and less for people dont know diffrent between work and play
"im broke i spent all of my money on nonexistent hats to wear while being ruthlessly spawncamped by snipers my team is always full of gibuswearing pyrovision scouts i have five mvm vouchers yet no tour of duty badges because my team always goes full sniper and spy and one pyro i cant enjoy the sounds of my characters pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears ive gotten into arguments with nine yearolds about who has a better beard which doesnt exist this is my favorite game of all time one thousand, one hundred and ten"
there was a deer hunter game back in twenty tens i played it was much more better than this crap there is no vehicle to use here no rewards your game paying membership to buy licenses really the do you think this is real life
early access reviewbeautiful idea okay concept but all that running just to be sniped blown up by a tank that your team has no means to destroy or shot by a camper because he and their team in general lack the incentive to defendattack a position just kills that gameplay expect many onesided games gameplay that consists of running and wondering where you are and a lack of any weaponry that can actually kill someone accurately the higherlevel guns will instantly kill you btw dont get me wrong this game was kindof fun at first but as you progress you lose the ability to progress unless you buy up finally the bigger battles especially have lots of issues with bugs and lagging so much so that i had to delete the game entirely honestly dont get this game it isnt worth it
early access reviewbefore everyone shouts fortnite clone just calm yo and read ahead rr acheives a fun addictive smooth gameplay experience whilst it has a fortnite art style that is where the line in the sand is drawn it is a br with a difference it has classes unlimited amo and a horse which you can cast at any time to traverse across the map give this game a try you wont be disapointed at the time of reviewing only squads was available solo and duo modes need to come out quickly though
fun game been in it since twenty thirteens back during alpha closed beta stages has been a ton of fun since then definitely suggest picking this game up especially as its free to play with that meaning anything bought can be found crafted traded for in gamepros randomly generated worldspersonal build areas you can take with you gameplay at later stageslots of mounts hats blocksfun combatunique classesdecent crafting systemboatsthere is a clan guild system clubsbetter quality than rift imomultiple biomes bossesdungeons for solo or group runshundreds of recipe scrolls to findtwitch eventsclub events partiesmastery rank and player lvl are separate mastery rank up to two hundred currentlycons building system can be finneky and has a small learning curvelots of grinding for mats easier with a clubhas some repetative elements to itoverall the game is fantastic and definitely something that can just be picked up for a bit and play get loot and come off again then do it all again the next time with the same feel as i said it can be grindy but its not as bad as most other mmos so dont let that deter you from having a good time the community is a lot of fun and are helpful on the forums in game if you ever have trouble check out the wiki for items and locations or speak up in global chat
this game ing sucks it is pay to win if you f2p expect to get rolled on by everyone the programming and algorithm is built to make you as frusterated as possible if you dont put money into it facts dont kid yourself and think the developers wouldnt do this its obvious dont expect fair match making dont expect to have fun past the first story mode all it does it make me angry and that isnt what gaming is about hey if you want to throw hundres if not thousands of dollars into the game im sure you could compete and maybe have fun probably not this t and you bethesda
quite honestly this is the worst fps ive ever played extremely clunky and frustrating mechanics the physics are just riduclously bad you cant drive a vehicle over a railroad track it just stops you like a brick wall random boulders are hidden at river crossings seemingly purposefully just to get in your way it is so frustrating not fun at all weapons are all extremely unbalanced and often get magical headshots out of nowhere this is rageinducing when it happens to you and when you do it to somebody else its not even fun its just like wow i killed that guy oh game is also riddled with bugs one in particular locks you in crouch mode and wont let you do anything all you can do is sit there and get killed and dont even get me started on the greedy money grab of in game purchases so stupid whoever recruited the devs at reto must have purposefully gotten all the bteam and cteam players they could find theyre honestly just not good at their jobs should you play this game absolutely not look elsewhere
real grindy game thats pretty fun early to mid tier but falls off extremely fast late game due to its unbalanced tiering system that places late ww2 vehicles with cold war era vehicles along side with teammates that will consistantly spam commands to attack objectives while they themselves are only out to get kills and never attempt to assist you in anyway shape or form
early access reviewfun gameplay loop with a great twist on the already tight battle royal formula rpglike skills and classes good loot system with rarities solid map decent enough netcode janky animations pickup radius is very specific
"spent more then one thousands hours in this game but to be honest i cannot recommend it right now started playing it like two years ago and even back then there were some unfavorable factors in it but still i enjoyed it really much because its a free game after all do not agree it is pay to win but the grind have become really annoying over the time its ww2 shooter that reminded me of good old battlefield one thousand, nine hundred and forty two i think i gave enough time the developers to show me they are trying to improve the game but most of patches did nothing more then adding fancy but useless stuff ingame maps are big but people cant find each other and there is no intense action but camping with snipers in bushes and tanks pixelshooting you from other corner of the map paradrops and jeep raids are best way of taking flags like in arcade style but one more thing about the grind i played with like three hundred hours with main footmen and till now ive reached only level fifteen out of twenty two just imagined i have to play till i retire from work to reach cap and instantly got frustrated still not to present biased opinion here are the good things in game many vehicles weapons and mods for them good and fresh update to bf42 ww2 experience some tactical and strategic skills necessity for playing dont want to discourage you if you are new to the game give it a try but keep in mind that community is dying and development got stuck and do not expect much from hg in the future"
early access reviewit does some things right like taking advantage of its digitial nature with card gimmicks like warp which lets you play the card if it was the next card you would draw from the deck it also does some things wrong like no card play history left me frantically hitting the replay button to learn more about the card that was just played yes there is an instant replay system although it was often too fast for me to read the cards even in slow mode and some cards dont go to the graveyard where you can read their effects the tutorial holds your hand a bunch often forcing you into bad moves to teach a point until about the last two colors which makes it easily skippable since the game already shows hints throughout it also blocks the screen a bunch with info telling you more about the card effects each time you draw a card with a new effect which makes it even easier to miss what the opponent is playing after the tutorial i started with the gauntlet mode since it was my first quest and it was always somewhere between beating the ai to negative hp or getting mana drought even with the very nice 4mana mulligan system in place to lessen it yes even in the premade beginner decks i forgot to mention that the last round of gauntlet always has a gimmick like the top card of your deck is played instantly which often results in gimmicks that favor the ai and that the next time you play gauntlet its a harder difficulty which does not benefit players who simply want a quick way to try out various decks with ai or earn quick gold the worst part is that the ai will often continue playing cards to stregthen its army dragging the match on further even when it has a flying creature you cant block that does lethal damage to you while it usually makes smart moves it often plays very slow which can be annoying when youre losing this is something i expect from either a player who doesnt realize they won or one who likes to torment their enemies not something a bot should do as for draft and casual games in my experience the queue times are only about a minute or less although if you jump right into casual youre going to be playing prebuilt starter decks vs customized player decks unless you buy some packs with ingame currency the reward system for both gauntelt and draft is good you get a few loses before it makes you start over but you always get rewards usually gold at first then gold and cards then gold and card and free booster packs you also get free random boosters each time you level up one of the individual colors i mean random as opposed to specifically giving you more cards of that colorpuzzle mode or as its otherwise known win this turn or die to a fire spell isnt very rewarding as it gives you very little gold and very little practical application since its a dumb solution to a hypothetical situation that would never happen in a game like you having four power and four types of influence but your opponent having twelve power two types of influencegold is used to buy packs about one thousands a pack and five thousands gold you earn at about twentyfive gold per match if youre a bad player in gauntlet five hundred if you play against players who often have better cards than you is required to buy enough for a draft which you keep the cards from crystals are for more exclusive stuff ususally cosmetic stuff when its only purchasable with crystals theres a thrid currency called shiftstones and you get them for beating various objectives and can earn more by turning in duplicates of cards you dont use but i still for the life of me cant figure out their purpose i now figured out you have to rightclick on cards in collection to craft new ones you can also destroy cards you hate for more shiftstones even though i did some find enjoyment playing it i was often bored andor frustrated with very long games that rewarded me very little even if i did manage to come out on top i cant personally recommend this game because if i had a dollar for each time i conceded a game in casual id have enough money to buy a better game than this although its still better than mtg arena
early access review2017 update tried robocraft out again for a few hours to see where progress has been made or lost as predicted most changes are made due to the dwindling playerbase this explains why in the past they removed barriers to matchmaking like tier divisions level affected matching reducing the amount of players per team etc i joined now to find that theyve further made changes that exacerbate imbalanced matches by removing level requirement to unlock cpu giving everyone the same cpu allotment at maximum and allowing bots of any cpu mixture to play together it simply totals up the cpu on a team and makes it match up on the other team the problem with this is it inevitably ends up where youll have one team with cpu evenly spread among them ranging from 14k to the maximum and the other team will be full of scouts with a single person at maximum cpu the game still suffers mobmentality wipeouts and favors it to be played as so as much as there are cries of tactics are valid nothing still beats team rushing sadly though these changes have done nothing to help new players against old hats like myself and even older hats who understand triforcing and damage mitigation which is near gone most resorting to either sheer bricks upon bricks or mobility evasion read drones only played a dozen matches today lost one and thats because i decided to use a stupid bot youd expect a noob to one megaleg rocket launcher shield gen thats it and even then it was a close loss the ultimate kick to the teeth though is the changes to the battle arena mode specifically the imbalance detected system where it will cause protonium to spawn on the map if the enemy destroy it they instantly equal the progress the winning team has made all this serves to do is infuriate the winning team and delay the match even further as the losing team may have now equalised but is still on a losing footing control point wise if the losing team choose to ignore the protonium and focus on the control points again theyre still on a losing footing as it stands robocraft has an average weekly player base of three thousand spiking six thousand in twenty fourteens it was fourteen thousand spiking twenty five thousand lets see how you fare in twenty eighteens freejam if youre even still around2016 update fj are now trying to censor negative reviews as abusive even if they are not https twitter give up with robocraft tldr robocraft devs dont know what they want their game to be theyve tried dmtdm esports creative building moba player choice progression forced progression bland progression each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying any work players have put in to creating their bots they establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of balancing or enabling player creativity and doing the complete opposite not to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes for example mm being broken turning it into who has the most medics winsand hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification because not all bots were classified correctly translation one in maybe one hundred were wrong and its haaaardedit to include the latest update max loadout again fj dont understand normal development practices they threw in massive changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke flak is bugged dmg nano is bugged lmbrmb superspeed heal msmgs are bugged free aim firing without los matchmaking is atrocious still blink and dsm are stupidly expensive both rpgc and cpu they should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink instead of thistoo many wild changes one step forward two steps back is this developers motto robocraft initially had a sensible mixture of creativity and function there was also a sensible mix of grind progression and sense of achievement it was a little lacklustre in places for example the rp system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how effective those unlocks were as you progressed in level and cpu your bots got bigger your weapons better this has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order over time with no player input once you unlock an item that is it theres no improvement everything is by default tier ten this in turn made building robots boring no more balancing weaponry vs armor vs mobility if you chose to go cosmeticbot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in theme now sure you can build a bot exactly as you want as long as you like yellow pink white grey brown as your color palette the other colours are locked to premium note they touted this flattening of tiers as an improvement to creative robot building then theres the slew of problems with actual gameplay mechanics initially there were balancing issues as expected they kind of balanced themselves out up until unleashedlegendary update and the devs got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except smgs this last update saw them add the near useless flak severely nerf the medics nano and turned it into smgcraft again they also did away with many of the useful gameplay information elements spotting now just says enemy spotted with no indication of flier hover walker they claimed this is because bots were complicated to classify yet for the most they were classified correctly this means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets this also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is rail heavy and needs more smg or plasma the game has also suffered match making issues from day one resulting in differing metas the latest of which is the team who has the most medics wins the hiding of bot type and spotting call outs i think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was six rails and two plasmas vs say six smgs and two medics put simple the devs have taken this game in far too many directions too rapidly and with no forethought initially it was a dmtdm game then they opened it up to the creative block builders then expanded to boss battles removed was one megabot vs lots of little bots quite fun then switching to try their hand at mobalike tower matches then trying to create some kind of bespoke robot market where players can sell their bots but their currency system is too expensive to support its like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half assing it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players this is likely the reason why they flattened their game down to basic progression
early access reviewdo you like space flight simulators do you like mobas do you like playing support do you like playing tank do you like playing adcbruiser well fractured space has it allseriously though if you like mobas but want to change the game style a bit you have to play this i mean me myself i stopped playing for a while yesterday i launched it by mistake played one game another and another and another and another and another and it was one am this game will make me have to put an auto shutdown on my computer again
tries to copy bigger games of the genre like h1z1 or dayz at least its free i dont recommend it tough graphics are horrible and sounds dont even work properly you can get yourself some ammo and guns right when you spawn if you are lucky enough sadly the map is too big and it will take a while to move from point a to point b most of the locations are kinda the same so dont even bother going away from the middle of the map where all the action is
early access reviewi really wanted to like this game being a huge fan of tcgs but the resource system is the worst ive ever encountered i promtly lost nine out of my first twelve games due to not drawing enough resources which immediately turned me off from the game the absolute worst thing you can experience in a card game is not even being able to compete and dying without playing a single card this game needs to fix its horrendous mulliganresource system before anyone should even think about investing timemoney into it
is fun at first but the poorly made physics engine and crappy graphics honestly ruin it it is very much a paytowin game as many steam games are but this is too extreme any player that hasnt spent more than fifty is practically instantly destroyed and is almost impossible to go up in without spending some cash would not recommend sorry
contrlling sucks hard to get around as a newbieexpensive unlike another game here that is free2play but awesome this doesnt give you anything freegraphics suckdid i mention controlling sucks no just nooo
since the update fifty one only teams including players i would call them bots as they act like that lol that play like a monkeysit s so annoying losing like 50battles in row it makes u bored so much this game is until u are losing battles and missing shots then it gets great and i really enjoyed it but it wants your vallet to be empty how unexpected for wg and free game xdit isn t a game for impatient people and those who have problems with angerrecommending this game depends on mood after a few battles
early access reviewdirectx9no end game like the japaneseno arenabattlegroundno rankingall dungeons you can soloservers constantly either down or full waitig three hours on que not worth early access maybe free to play but even than its going to be a cash crab grab game do not waste your time refund asap if you bought early access
early access reviewthis game is good to play once but the sounds are extremely wacky and while the pot clanging is annoying it is even harder to judge the distance of gunfire also while the environment is pretty its not exactly fun to play in
woo boy this is gonna be a fun review tldr at the end this is a good game it really is theres so much i want to say about it so ill get started graphically this game is amazing not because its hyperrealistic but because the artstyle is unique to a point where its almost impossible for it to look aged this game is ten years old and still looks great gameplaywise its fun you run around you shoot people on the opposite team its not always shooting bullets though there are nine classes each with their own unique weapons there are rocket launchers grenade launchers and flamethrowers there are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use the different classes are played in a variety of different ways so theres probably a favorite class for everyone and then theres character design i could probably gush about this for hours but i wont each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette they are all very unique to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme the scouts main weapons are all scatterguns the heavys main weapons are all miniguns etc these characters not only have unique designs but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities its so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free the characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable there is probably something to be said about diversity here especially because of its competitor overwatch theres no dancing around it this game is simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as overwatch is however the characters presented in this game have far more personality than the characters presented in overwatch i have played overwatch before and unlike this game was not enthralled by the characters with this game i was almost immediately drawn in because of the characters themselves not just the gameplay sadly however women designs were once upon a time made for this game but for whatever reason were scrapped they were very unique designs too and if the team actually had followed through on making them and had applied the same effort they did for their male characters they would have made some of the best dang female characters in gaming im gonna apologize about the overwatch comparison but im still salty about blizzard making halfbaked female characters and then being touted as progressive when theyre really just playing the middle to attract the most players the tf2 character designers could make women characters that would crush overwatch in every way if they ever decided to do that there is also something to be said about the community it sucks big time if youre a woman or have a high pitched voice youre probably better off not using the voice chat at least in casual mode if you do youll probably get sexist comments hurled at you or if they just think youve got a high pitched voice called a squeaker and might even get kicked a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist sexist homophobic and every ist and phobic thing in the book into the chat its painful to read but hey it sure is fun getting dominations on homophobes and then taunting after killing them so thats something you can do of course it isnt all bad and most games of this nature end up with a community like that anyway so its no surprise really there are a bunch of good folks out there too ive met some good folks through this game and if you play it for long enough you will too just dont be surprised about the bad folks plus theres a bunch of different subcommunities that are usually full of nice people tldr its a good game and its free to pick up and play so youve got nothing to lose but your time its fun has a bad overall community but nice little subcommunities unique and fun characters and a lot of cool maps play it and have fun
access reviewthe game is good and bugfree and i would really recommend it but the reason i am not is the privacy policy my god they collect everything web searches pc stats what antivirus you use plugins of your web browser and what not it is really scary
early access reviewbest free battle royale game maybe fortnite is still better made but ok very nice weapons i just want more optimized fps new map and there is no option to change resolution in game
early access reviewmuch like everyone else here has said this really is like mtg mixed with a bit of hearthstone basically hearthstones visual style and ability to add elements and a few other ideas like weapons mixed with most of the best mtg mechanics the tutorial impressed me enough for me to want to drop money on it which says a lot i think especially since ive played dozens of these games
including su27 flanker 1990s lock on modern aircraft and flying cliffs early 2000s dcs represents ca twenty years of development which slowly begins to show the basic systems of a flight sim are in place and this project is on the brink of entering early access while for the first fifteen years it used to run like as soon as there was some scenery on the screen like big cities this has now also reached a point where you can play it with most details on a mid range computer yay i recommend to get the free version and give it the time it deserves you get two planes with their systems modelled which is more content than most full price games and it will cost you absolute nothing because it represents the content of dcs ten years ago if you have made up your mind you want to see the real deal you could invest another fifty to three hundred to get the best flight simulator on the market thats up to you you know by now that there will be several bummers so here we go this is not for little children who thrown themselves on the floor when something does not go their way as of now you will need to run two different versions of the game actually three if you also want to run steam an alpha and a beta and although a unified version has been announced for early twenty sixteens we now almost have twenty eighteens and we still have no firm release date this is the sim that created the original soon a lot of parts are missing and unlikely to come out before two thousand and thirty it still misses a campaign there are some linear campaigns but they are or any dynamic elements you will also most likely just fly around the planes and never do actual combat with them because that takes years to learn now you can just and wait for a better home flight sim to come around on a market that has already been dead since ca two thousand and five or spend the next months learning hundreds of switches in fully clickable cockpits take off and feel like you are in a real airplane no other flight sim comes anywhere near that
enjoyable at firstits action based gameplay is quite fun but the whole game gets really repetitive much like all the cryptic games it is a f2p in its traditionnal way you can play for free but all the cool stuff are not free same as all the consummables used to reset your ability points etc
early access reviewto discribe it with the words of one of my friendlist players looks like wing commander twenty fifteens its not exactly like this but it has the same flair its fun to play try it
i have been playing freestyle since two thousand and seven of course back then it was the original freestyle street basketball by sierra online now we have the second installment of this series and it is great there is no other game in the market that allows you to play team basketball with your friends like this one does i think it has room for improvement but what doesnt i really hope now being on steam it will allow them to do greater things with this game i totally recommend this to basketball fans specially if you plan to play with friends
this is pure simulator with almost none of virtual help its all up to you and your driving style i love that in simulators when they just put you in action and leave you to learn about the game through the gameplay when i started playing i thought this game is all about paying for extra stuff yea it is expensive as hell but its a good game sure only one fictional track for use is terrible the sound is awesome and so are the physics first feel 610gameplay 910controller support 910physics nine hundred and ten driving one thousand and ten crashing physics one thousand and ten crash damage three hundred and ten sound 1110price 310overall game experience nine hundred and ten very fun but very expensive and a lot of locked stuff ruins the fun gameplay especially if you have to pay for every car and track edit most of the competitions lend you everything neccessery for racing so you can explore new cars and tracks that feature is very good
with the addition of the scourge warlock recently i decided to give this game another try and ho boy do i enjoy it let me just say this i hit level thirty i can now hunt dragons yes
definitely not free to play id rather spend the money on buying a rollsroyce and ram it against a wall until it looks like a friggin smart the amount of money you need to spend to earn the priviledge of not having doc telling you you cant shoot is absurd buy weapons buy bullets buy callers this isnt a game id recomend for anyone
early access reviewlooked like smash so i downloaded itplayed itgot my friends to play itthey love itget a friend for 2v2then the adventure of instense battles and laughs startdownload it and have fun
cannot get enough of this cross of so many games its actually original ive spent so much time designing my house its no longer a game its a dream that must happen and nothing like the others devs are amazing and obviously work day and night to make this a true masterpiece

early access reviewbesides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something or you could just spend real money to buy it because its that kinda game i would have to say this game sucks from the realistic gameplay the completely balanced factions or maybe the realtime wars that players influence i would have to say that it doesnt really live up to anything that it sayslets start with the free to play part it as stated above can take upto weeks just to get enough money and xp to buy a weapon however if you think that youre above this and dont want to wait you can just spend the ten us dollars to buy it right there and then buying it with credits even allows you to completely skip over the xp requirements along with the moneythen comes the realistic and simulation battles if one could call them that i believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model which although had some nice hopes is for lack of better words sht many a times i have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas when i get into a firefight with another soldier mid shooting my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isnt in position because apparently my gun was running into some invisible force for firing then theres the maps oh how i hate all of the maps from large open areas with almost no cover from base to base to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog all in all the maps arent that great either simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game after that there goes the balance which just as everything before is little but existent id like to paint a little picture for you here american bombing planes two bombsgerman bombing planes one bombsoviet bombing planes four bombs kinda crazy right but the german plane must have some redeeming qualities right like better mobility or stronger bullets nope its the exact same as the other if not worse after the planes comes the tanks and weapons id like to just say real quick germany is easily the most underpowered and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the soviets into the game which look to have the best weapons from the poor guns of the german to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the american weapons to the overly good starting soviet guns its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction well over others tanksvehicles while pretty well balanced are very overpriced and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction all in all the games balance seems to be lacking and its actually rather annoying to see the devs favor some factions over others those realtime wars you were expecting or that huge scale battles that you thought you were going to get wrong again while yes there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on and are ranked most battles are only sixteen v sixteen this looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the class variety that the game has leading to searching for game up to ten minutes and thats without a squad being in a squad can take ages finally after getting into a game you may notice that the whole server consist of just that class or very few other you can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay and overly long searching time for a game that it may plop you in which ends roughly a minute after your joining also im not really going to approach the whole campaign thing as its seems to literally be pointless wars end within a day and most of the time it doesnt give props to the right faction but you can almost always bet the germans lose even when they win all in all this game really in a trainwreck that yes i have had some fun playing needs a lot and i cant stress enough how much i mean that of work also before you say oh well youve spent almost one hundred hours playing the game it must be good i would like to state that i have only spent that much time in game because i wanted to be able to expierence a large portion of it so that i may give a proper rating and suggestions
valve ignores their community entirely oh heavy is underpowered his bullet travels three feet and then becomes useless lets nerf him againthe phlog is causing a problem lets buff it into the heavenswow those are some nice custom weapon skins dont mind the amount of work the user did on it lets ignore it allshould we test the update before we launch it nah thatll fix itself the prices on the tf market are too high who cares if it gives us money were happy people are outrageous about the matchmaking saying that one team is filled with f2p gibuses and the other team is with p2ps with thousands of hours should we add some kind of balancingrank system naaah unbalance is funhey lets put the weakest character in the game heavy against one of the high tier ones pyro and see who people like better that way we can nerf heavy even more and make pyro even stronger its balanced right people are saying that the vac system sucks since it takes three weeks two months for a single hacker to get banned and sometimes it doesnt even work should we add a new system nah the hacker get banned eventually so it doesnt matter the community is demanding more weapons from us lets add pointless reskins insteadyou need to stop right now look at you sitting in front of your computers with cheetos and money all over your shirt valve youre dirt to me stopping the development of games and doing nothing about cs go was painful to me but ruining this game was the last straw its time to stop
this is first and foremost a mobile game ported to steam is that a bad thing maybe the thing is that how much you spend is up to you but if you want to get your favorite individual cards you better hope they are rare or normal and not put in the abritrary packsrewards while the game gives free currency to get packs frequently it only happens with events that give it away in big lumps else youre getting trickles of gems second the game plays like pre5ds era yugioh with a smaller field to make games faster this is both a strength and weekness for the game as while this brings in vets of the game it can turn away more meta playersplayers whos favorite cardarchtype is not in the game third this game is very competitive at times and trys to subtlely nudge you into paying with the vegabond duelest who are just ghosts of high ranked pvp players who also duel with sometimes bs modifiers like having a full field or having only two cards in your hand add those modifiers with a good deck and the odds are so stacked against you at times its like an whale versus a mouse sure you can harp on me saying i only have one hundred hrs on the game but its a game that discurages playing for long without paying and while i dont mind having cards from postgx if youre gonna port an archtype port an archtype that fits within classicgx era not archtypes that have good syncrosxyzpendulum monsters

early access reviewgot in the game played one hour requested refund graphics are bad laggy as crap combat is wonky took me ten minutes to get through the first quest of the tutorial because the translations are so bad not to mention it was so overhyped and such a let down thats my fault though
early access reviewhey guys the game is great its a grind but who said it was gonna be easy i give it a 10add me on steam i have a community souly dedicated to aq3d and were building up purpose is for grind partis and guides tips and tricks and will eventually be converted into a guild add me if interested i am very active thanks
what can i say this game is amazing if you like realistic milsim games this is for you recently i got an oculus rift which completely elevated the experience i reccomend this game with and without vr in every way
a totally addictive substitute for a certain other blockbased sandbox adventure the name of which eludes me at present you start in a random location in a randomly selected world from a short list of handcrafted candidates that world is composed of things all of which are made of blocks of equal size there are some exceptions such as creatures and some objects all of which are unique quirky and enjoyable it is very easy to find yourself overpowered in this game and so far the only way that the devs have slowed down ones journey to overpoweredness is by making you work through items tier by tier as opposed to just making the best stuff as soon as you find the best materials i think the only times i have negative emotions about this game are when im mentally expecting something from that other game dammit its name is on the tip of my tongue but those moments are fewer and further between theyre also sufficiently different that one can easily enjoy both without either feeling redudant so ive reached the end of this review and still cant remember the name of the other game like this one just like that game however this one is essentially characterised by mining andor crafting
early access reviewsadly i feel like the most recent update is the death knell for the game what was once a promising and ridiculously fun game has been rendered into nothing more than a p2w slog that has lost all sense of what made once made it great
early access reviewlook at of hourse played to understand i am not just on a new game high this game is a great ccg that is very accessible to a new player and still relatively new so its not so deep and developed that a new player wont know whats going on but balance changes and new cards are added to keep everything fresh as well as monthly ladders with rewards for finishes do yourself a favor and just download it if youre looking for a ccg to try to get into and love to brew of do tournaments or draft or etc its one thousand and ten
this game is not worth a penny to put into this game is full of hackers and cheaters and is not any sort of fun at all if you want a real game that is far better then this and that is fun play arma three arma has way better graphics bigger maps more people can play and alot more oh and um you can actually get out of the tank as well on arma but can you do that here nope so arma three plus world of tanks minus please dont make the mistake of getting this and spending alllll of your money for a horrible game
the game is very fun and all there isent much grind but there is two things i dont like the optimization and how easy you can get the best gear i am constantly getting two thousand and forty fps in the game even tho i have a asus r9 two hundred and eighty series gpu eight gb ram amd phenomtm ii x4 nine hundred and fiftyfive processor four cpus 32ghz if i really tried i could get lumite in about twenty four hours if you arent into being creative in this game then the fun is gonna end pretty fast
dont play this its a p2w disguised as an f2p ive played for four years check realmeye if you dont think im telling the truth netherarum is my characters name i played in the web browser i probably will continue to play because this game is addicting however its stupid and broken now kabam has done nothing for the game and in fact has ruined it hackers spammers and cashgrabs make this game pretty much unfun to look at
early access reviewso i wanted to see what going on with all the commotion with this game after i left it around six months ago i think but it was a long time jumped into a game and was confused with everything the lasers fired so slowly better of with a shotgun really which defeats the point of and smg there would be lots of other stuff i would go into detail but i dont want to waste my time with a game i would play everyday but now ruined thanks to freejam if they changed the game to what is was before they added aero flaks then i would go back to the game because thats where it went all down hill
the game is very hardcore its short description is everything can oneshot you wanna play hardcore another longer description would be do you want to waste thirty minutes trying to buy a ring from other players welcome to the world of afk donotdisturb mode fakeoffer r3tardedtrader ignore trading system pros wide variety of builds any class can use any skill a huge passive skill tree reminds some kind of a star atlas many layers of improving your character skill gems passive skills god powers ascendancy rewards enchantments lots of skills customisation skills can be respec for a price of ingame currency keeps being updated with new content awesome gloomystyle graphics not cartoony like diablo three interesting endgame content interesting currency system this game has no gold as other similar games completely free the only noncosmetic thing you can buy is more tabs in your loot stashcons extremely awful optimisation you pc from twenty fourteens runs battlefield thirty four on ultra you will have eight fps in a multiplayer map here poor not interesting main storyline especially in comparison with diablo three most awful trade system ever based on adequacy of human beings which is absurd makes you a currency addict people farm currency to buy items instead of trying to get those items themselves oneshot mechanics many things can oneshot you regardless of your defenses

this game is fun whentldr i loved this game and it kicked me in the teeth this game is fun when youre fighting the enemy and not the game this game is fun when the game isnt punishing you for every step you take forwards constantly taunting you that youre just a little bit further away from that tank you want that aircraft you crave the game is fun when your vehicle isnt damaged and you have no way to repair it or on fire or being blown up in your spawn the game is fun when you get to play with your friends in the vehicles you want to play but still with realistic vehicle characteristics except you cant because realistic doesnt allow germany to play with most other nations for no reason this game is fun when youre not losing money each time you spawn a vehicle this game is fun when the developers arent bashing your knees with the keyboard and trying to steal your wallet would i recommend this game to have fun sure as long as youre happy with the above
i came into trove expecting a game that would peak my interest for a day or two so i could take a small break from wow i have since cancelled my membership to wow and am playing trove daily this game is like minecraft mixed in with the grind of vanilla wow if you dont like grindy games do not play this game there are levels and masery levels in this game with almost forty hours i have a level twenty character and my master level is thirty this game is a grindfest but insanely fun w xxnathanimalxx if you want to join a club guild
worth a look if you like fallout as it has that fo charm but far too shallow and repetitive to grab your attention for longer than a few hours very disappointing as it has the potential to be a great game if there was just more to do once youve grown your vault to a decent size and unlocked all the rooms bummer three hundred and ten
early access reviewthis is quite possible the best f2p the best ccg and is one of the best card games i have ever played diverse meta great rewards for playing overlall one of my favorite games i currently have going great game when watching tv or just focusing on it
there are few people who have never heard of the ancient scrolls the elder scrolls every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans arena and daggerfol for those who are older morrowind and oblivion for those younger and finally skyrim for the youngest all these games can be called cult each introduced something of its own into the world of elder scrolls what we brought the game the elder scrolls online tamriel unlimited lets try to figure it out firstly i do not agree that this game falls out of the general series trampling on the canons of scrolls yes the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive he is not elected as was before not nerevarin and not dovakin but only one of thousands out of millions this seems to hurt secondly what do we have all the same nirn torn by the war and on the brink of death events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series probably this fact also embarrasses many well in the third the changed game model which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case i can not say that innovations have pleased me but i have to put up with this
in short path of exile is a must tryplay game if you enjoy arpg gamespath of exile started in twenty thirteens and is still growing path of exile brings arpg that gives massive ways of building your character and the design is quite gotich type story now when it comes to story for me itself the story was eh not saying that story is bad but will say that it didnt realy drag me in that much too feel amazed not to mention that i didnt realy dig that much through dialog from charactersgraphics the game as i said looks gothic style too me but even thought it looks like that what makes me a bit annoyed is how your character feels like when it comes to design no matter how much you try you will still look almost like a hobo if you dont start buying some cosmetics or earn them through eventsgameplay poe did great when it comes to gameplay and how its abilitys works theres so much when it comes to making your build its soo fun example you found a fireball and now you want it to be even more good ok just slap multi shot and slap more stuff and combine gems and all that and you get some epic cluster ability that is so satisfying that your pc freezes than we got a massive skill tree realy massive i aint kidding what i dont enjoy about path of exile doe is that your own build if you are not experienced with the game will seventy five suck the close you are to the end the more and more you see your build failing now its not always gonna be like that but still the game allows you to build anything but if you wanna reach to the end you will probably have to stick too few common things even though you dont want to
would be easy enough to recommend for casual action rpg fans if it wasnt full of the usual mmo malarkey of getting you to fork over money for every little thing so naw stay away dont bother game is cute but the gameplay is tried and true would be the most cherisable way to describe but really it gets boring pretty fast
early access reviewso this game is a good horror game that relies mostly on the its going to get you scares and pop ups youll find notes scattered about that develop a story and pull you into the game to give you a reason to keep going the rooms also do a good job at being interesting and giving enviormental clues i wont say much else as experincing it first hand is really the only way to even understand what others might be saying i wound up dying in a fashion that i didnt understand in room three hundred and twelve due to an encounter but ill defintely pick it up again to see it through to the end worth the free price one thousand and ten would unwrap a dissapointing present again
early access review ing bad suck my your ing dumbass bad ing game autistics only play this boring bad game you gett ing cancer playing this ing bad game suckmy in badd learn to make game idiots
pretty much the only hunting game that takes a stap at not being a fast passed arcade shooter been playing for years and i keep goin back the range of hunting areas species and hunting techniques mean you can keep the repetivity at bay new content is fairly regular but the game overall is expensive a membership is about twenty thats not bad but a new rifle will cost you five and their is so much stuff to buy and this game is not free to play you can play but its more of an on goig demo you will get one basic gun and one basic shotgun and two species on a rotation its access to the tip of the iceberg to see if its for you
i dont recommend this because after a while thay shut you donw for nothing and then you will get a error saying sever call timed out what means sorry your a loser and we shuted down your game so i dont want people getting this game atherwise if it was a update i will delete this and recommend it but for now i dont
this game used to be amazing i loved it i binged it due to the fact that you could drop in and out on a fly play with your friends and valve public servers were easy to get in to the queue times now take forever casual servers are irritating to play on this modernization that the developers are implementing is cutting the head off of the hydra eventually itll run out of heads and this game will crash and burn before i loved it it was my favourite game but now i dont want to touch this game with a ten foot pole rip team fortress two
early access reviewnote i have only played two games so farthis is exactly what it says a spaceship battle game it is well done considering the point at development it is in there is a bit of a problem with just picking up the game and playing as it does not explain how the game works and what the goal of the game is very well but once you figure it out it is fine the people i played with were friendly and helpful so if you ever do not understand something just ask and they should help i look forward to further developement of this game
war thunder is by far the leader in flight simulators out there despite being free to play war thunder has perfected graphical detail with painstakingly modelled aircraft and now tanks to create the ultimate world war two aerial and ground battle experience the user interface is intuitive allowing for the use of just mouse and keys to control an aircraft or tank however the option of a joystick is there for more experienced players as well as the focus on multiplayer battles gaiijin have also credited the game with a series of single player missions that help earn credits in game whilst the war thunder economy has seen rapid change over the last fifty six patches it has finally been levelled out to create a gradual but still progressive and entertaining progression system that allows for a long but rewarding levelling system one area that lacks the polish that is seen in other areas of the game is the cooperative multiplayer as this aspect of the game sees a confusing friending and squad system that not only is clunky to use but also reduces frame rate substantially and this is a game killer for players that use less powerful pcs or laptops conclusively war thunder presents itself as a highly successful game with superb graphics gameplay rewards and a growing player base as well as the addition of constantly updated features do to its open beta status i highly recommend this game nine hundred and ten
early access reviewgetting anywhere is hard but thats probably because you need to pay for the gamei cant really recommend it on its own but its like 2mb and you could probably have some fun with a few friends for a whileim not going to say i dont recommend this game because i mostly played this game at 2am with a friend and i think i had a good time
note to see this review in its true form go to http htmlplanetside two is massive multiplayer freeroam and free two play the gameplay of planetside two varies sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas other times massive armies will attack for a large command post now because planetside two is a free to play game you might be wondering if the paying players get an advantage the answer would yes and no yes because paying players can get gunsarmor and upgrades faster no because they dont get any paidonly weapons for example they cant drop two thousand and thirty and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them players in planetside two can choose from six classes light assaultheavy assaultcombat medicsniperengineer and mech suit planetside two is meant to be a tactics game and ive had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit in planetside two instead of clans you have outfits now you can join a platoon without being in that outfit but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online visualwise planetside two is great textures are highres shadows are soft and lighting is done just right the best part is that it doesnt take too much gpu or cpu power the not so great part is that it only runs in 32bit mode gameplay takes part on three massive openworld continents on the world auraxis the three continents you fight on are indaresamir and amerish each map has its own theme one is icy and cold another is warm and wet and the last is a dry arid wasteland the servers are normally lagfree ive played at least fifteen hours and i can only remember lagging out four times and that was when i was in a two hundred person battle one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other leveled up players but this just means the noobs should team up with the veterans and provide support like a playing as a snipermedic or engineer another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base and that is that most players dont want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in call of duty shooting people in little killing sprees thats not how this game works and if you try to play it like call of duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win the only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line maybe a coop campaign it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the devs put into the factions and areas i guess thats asking too much for a mmo anyways check planetside two out its freeits fun and its on steam
war thunder is sadly one of the game i decided to quit after following it over a long time playing a few hundred hours nonsteam and two hundred and fortythree hours on steam i can safely say that i am done with it ive been a beta tester for planes tanks and have had experience with early gameplay and the final gameplay very often not a big difference between those two the flight part is very good might be even one of the best free flight games on the market you have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways bomber dive bomber torpedo bomber fighters attackers jets the matchmaking is okay depending on the game mode you are playing you have the choice between arcade realistic simulation the names indicate how realistic each mode is a huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels the sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane i would still recommend this for casual players the tank part is incredibly bad many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta but were never resolved the devs were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixxed while they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during ww2 hey doesnt matter lets fully load them with it now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable overall i do not recommend this game the grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic
this is the best game everhello i am sander i am gone revieuw this game for you also you can add me on smite my name is dutchlol446 eu only the gameplay is amazing it feels like you are a real got the update the game in a good way not like league of legends that its only good for compertive no this game is also fun as cusal i really enjoy this game i buyed the ultimate god pack so i get every old and new god that they are gone make if you gone play this game buy it you will love it also the voice packs are amazing what i dont like are the old skins the new skins are a lot better then the old ones some times you play with players that quit league of legends so the flame you if you are bad but the most players are really friendly pros many gods to choosemany gamemodes compertive as casul good communtiy the listen to the community god level clansesportscons no jezus rating nine hundred and ten
lots of replayability no pay to win mechanics great skins a slew of diverse characters to choose from and an entertaining esports scene this game offers quite a bit considering its free
early access reviewhirez corrected everything they did wrong the class system feels better than ever now and the gameplay is super enjoyable the people complaining in these reviews just havent gotten on the game recently guys obviously an alpha game is going to keep changing until they reach a good state and i believe they reached that state people need to realize this and come back into the game they once loved
early access reviewone of the best online tcgs ever plus its so generous compared to the others easy to craft cards as well so long as you know what you are doing missed event promos craft them
tribute summon lvl five monster and attackopponent uses enemy controller and takes my cardis about to wipe out my life pointsthey disconnecti still lose the duel1010 would duel again
early access reviewi can see why everyone is talking about how this is the next minecraft it certainly feels and looks like it i mean that in a very positive way if played right this could easily be the next thing im just worried about the ability to mod it seeing as it mainly seems to be online minecraft vanilla has a lot to play with but what really made the game what it is is the mods so i really hope to see large amounts of modding happening with this game in the future as it is if you like minecraft even just a bit good chance youll like this plus its free hard to argue with at least trying it
pay for better loot its fun but premium on this crap game common no scope weapons on far shoots its like slingshot with stones72 hours to join official stupid idea by someone madeif your char die you have ten minute to wait or make another one but its so stupid
"realm of the mad god is a massively multiplayer online shooter video game created by wild shadow studios acquired by kabam in june two thousand and twelve and later sold to deca games in july two

an eight bit pixelated art style2 players control characters who have been transported to the realm of oryx the titular mad god to become food for his many minions and abominations which the players

steam5contents hide linksgameplayeditthe game consists of players shooting projectiles from their weapons and destroying enemies to earn experience fame and equipment a character moves around using the wasd keys though other controls can be chosen and uses the mouse to aim and clicks to shoot6 contrary to usual practice in mmos the experience for killing monsters is awarded in full to each player present rather than split this along with the possibility of teleporting to any player on the map instantly and a cooldown of ten seconds to teleport again makes it very easy and attractive to team up after a certain amount of experience has been earned the player levels up and their attributes are raised allowing them to fight more powerful enemies and unlock more classes the maximum level a player can achieve is level twenty the player can then gain fame on their character which eventually grants permanent stars that indicate accomplishment and may entitle one to a place on the games leaderboards upon death character death is permanent meaning that the characters items and statistics are lost players begin their game sessions in the nexus a safe haven which can be teleported to at

its beyond amazing and i am a real world professional driver endless options they are always improving the simulation to make it as real as it gets i personally want to see more real world tracks like the world famous daytona rolex twentyfour hr road coarse and the next indurance track on the list the world famous sebring also known for its grueling twelve hr endurance races road amaerica was just released and its also one of my personal favorites i have hundreds if not thousands of laps at all of these three tracks combined and the technical skills each track demands from teams and drivers alike are some of the most epic feats of human and machine strength found in only a few places anywhere in the world so if you want the thrill of speed excitement and the feeling of being a real driver like me i highly recommend this driving simulation it will also help you become a better real world driver if thats what your also looking for but remember racing belongs in the designated places where safety and control measures have been specifically designated to save lives street racing is not cool but road coarse racing is drive safe on the public streets and highways but go for broke and find the outer edge of your envelope on the race track sincerely neil nine hundred and eighteen smith
this game is super fun first i did not liked it becouse i lost my account but i got it back and right now i love all the dragons that are in the game hope they add more titans dragons three
so this game is awesome ive been playing this more than any of my games its like minecraft but for me is way looking than minecraft i so far dont dislike anything but things will be fixed since i have been experiencing i like that you can glide use teleporters explore a big map have or play with many many people and can be for selected people you want to play with i really like the idea that you can claim your own land from first claim i made it but the thing is you can keep going with claims and before reaching out to less than ten claim somewhere there you have to pay coins a currency ingame but its worth it because you really dont need two hundred claims to build things i like the fact you can build underground and not sure how long can you keep going and same with sky how long can you reach i like the fact that you can build with your friends got ten claims your friends got ten claims well now you could say you both have twenty claims if so i like that i can build two claims building and have someone do the other half in two claims i beleive theres so much to this game i really like the blocks items etc i like the biomes and really like the creatures
game is not optimized in the least even for the platform it is designed on at the same time as a guest you are limited to one gun one target one hunting area any unlocks or purchases are for temporary use only no kind of xp item unlocking system whether bought with the impossibletoearn ingame currency or real money on top of that online connections are miserable even to noping servers and hosts would recommend for mild ammusement for a couple hours but certainly not any kind of real investment in either time or money
early access reviewill buy the game at the regular price a lot of the negative reviews are from butt hurts who are salty typical mmo launch this game isnt a genre changing event though the combat is niche and hopefully they figure out the action combat system asap
this is probably one of the best and most unique team based shooters out there i cant even begin to explain it its simple yet complex at the same time even with nine different classes at first you may have no clue what the hell is even happening but after a little bit of playing once you learn this game you can never forget the combination between all the unique and fun weapons and all the other aspects such as having a conga dance with the other team and much much more you can play the game how ever you want and even after ten years this game still has a big community and is still getting updates even to this day even if this game sometimes makes me mad i will always love team fortress two
this game sucks there is too much salty people the community is and you dont need skill once you have all the gear that they put into this game this game is garbage i said it a million times and i wont hesitate to say it again it sucks the dungeons and first games are great giving you a purpose of how good the game feels then you meet the community and pvp system once again this game sucks if you rage easily do not play this game that is all
rotmg is a roguelike game that is heavily reliant on a stable internet connection and server connection in order to play the game unfortunately rotmg very frequently has problems with serverside lag unless you are comfortable with the fact that serverside lag will often kill your character making hours and hours of gameplay almost completely pointless dont even bother playing
one of the most freetoplay mobas youll find unlike other mobas in this one you can unlock skins and earn premium currency also known as gems simply by playing the game its wonderfully addictive if youre new or considering to play the game you can earn extra rewards by referring somebody if youre struggling to refer somebody you can always refer buddhano
this is a game with alot of selection for ships ranging from logistics to full on combat to campy sniper so much to play with and with the crew and ship custiomisation its good fun
first things first yes the game is free to play however at the free to play level you only can hunt mule deer cottontail rabbits you must own a capable gun to shoot them not included with the free to play option and cannot host multiplayer games only may join themthis game really shines when you put some money into it and unlock various other weapons access to hunting all animals the developers have definitely figured out the free to play monetization system almost everything costs real money however looking past the monetization system this is easily one of the best hunting simulations on pc i have ever played you definitely do not need to invest any money at all if you dont mind only using a two hundred and forty three rifle hunting mule deer i highly recommend this game even in the limited free to play form

a great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanics fractured space is a a beautiful game with great visual and sound design it has a very heavy focus on teamwork so being polite cooperating and reading your allies and your enemies behaviour is key you will need to learn and fast each ship similar to heros in other moba and mobaesk games has is strengths weakness and purpose understanding how to play each ship is key most games follow a fairly similar pattern cap mines fight for gamma attack enemy base dont let that fool you though just because the game has a mould doesnt mean you have to follow it each match will have its different fights and in each fight you might have to play slighly differently and if you emerge victorious from a fight you do feel a sense of pirde however it is not without its flaws the first and most important one is balance with so many ships and so many factors to take into account the game could be said to be unbalanced and that wouldnt be wrong it would however be a very narrow view as a player with over five hundred hours playing spread over around two years ive seen unbalanced in fs and its done nothing but improve and the devs have done nothing but learn if slowly at times but the game isnt perfect when it comes to balance dare i say it will never be perfect but which game is the single biggest issue however is the match maker or mm it uses a system called mmr which is based on win victories and defeats to balance matches needless to say its not the best system its been endlessly debated moaned about changed tweaked and is a constant work in progress if i were you dont get angry about it others will but just try to play the game help others and carry harder the second is to do with ecg themselves having talked to the devs i know they are a great bunch of guys and girls that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone they just have a funny way of showing it sometimes from random experimental patches suprise launches or lack of communication ecg definitely have their own way of doing things overall fractured space is a great game with fun and varied gameplay but not always balanced and with a wip mm ecg can seem to be a bit random at times but they mean well
early access reviewone of the best digital card games i have ever played it is super generous to the f2p with the rewards only downside is how jarring and long the tutorial is definetly give it a try if you like digital card games
devs have lost their sense of reality if a vehicles firepower needs to be nerfed it from the game the stats are broken and lack any balance what so ever it looks good runs good but has zero accuracy on most aspects the game modes are also terrible lacking depth and intellect to even get a more real experience playing in more difficult game modes just means more dumb spawn rules the devs just pile on content instead of expanding on what they already have what good is adding ten more tanks and planes to the game if the game modes are to simple and boring would i recommend this game no
early access reviewthis game was great and showed so much promise in december two thousand and fifteen but then the developers made a continuous series of radical changes and crashed this once great game in to the ground the reward system is braindead and there is nothing epic about the loot freejam have lost the plot
early access reviewi would recommend it cause its f2p thats iti got banned in game for no absolute reason havent had any support team contact me even tho i send ticketsall to this point ive quit the game because of this negligence

if you have a penchant for feeling completely let down by your teammates if you want to see team mates ignoring the objective and dying under towers in places they should never have been after fighting hard for nearly an hour and seeing defeat snatched from the jaws of victory this is the game for you no it really is do you have an unyielding sense that the participation aspect of team mates in communicating effectively to engeander positive cooperation in fulfilling victory after victory in both the battles of defending and attacking and the war as a whole is absolutely necessary then providing you have the ability to speak russian spanish and portuguese and understand that even though you have chosen to play on an english speaking server you are likely going to be in the minority and everything that goes wrong is going to be your fault waste no time install this game and jump in the incredibly forgiving and supportive community is waiting to help teach you how to play you to will soon have 65k mmr and can hang out in the reddit chat with the rest of the thirteen thirtysevens dotoists and just remember this one thing and you will never go wrong if someone has a lower mmr than you no matter what the issue is they are always wrong welcome and glhf
if you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game like others have mentioned the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying but then the experience is really rewarding if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process now in my book there are three types of fans when it comes to flying games lets see one the first type only want to grab the stick or keyboard and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else if you are from this type then go for battlefield series hawx or war thunder etc dont bother with dcs you will have hours of fun with the other titles that i mentioned and trust me there are some really good ones out there and ive personally tried most of them two this type of fans love flying and dont mind getting into some details about planes but they dont want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details if you belong in this category look up flaming cliffs three on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading three these are plane nerds they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading go download dcs and have fun thank me later now if you are the first type dont bother with dcs there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun dcs is for the other two types if you love flying but dont want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics then youre in the right place dcs has nonclickable cockpits in different planes where you dont have to know what every single switch does you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if youre willing to do so you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft but here is the thing you can by fc3 and get so many planes at a decent price if you go for dcs you will have to buy each plane separately expect for the two included in the free version the choice is up to you but keep reading finally if you are from the last type then you just have to grab your stick hop in a plane and start your journey there are clickable cockpits in the game where you actually need to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up take off navigate etc its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me theres an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with look no further because dcs not only brings you a realistic experience but it has better graphics and ingame physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now go look for yourself and compare this gem to fsx or fg and see the difference as a final note some say the planes are expensive i believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent but before purchasing any make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the dcs website usually you can by all planes for seventy off and more if you purchase multiple planes so then you wont have to cry over your empty wallet just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal i say again if youre from the second type consider going with dcs fc3 you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately
im giving this game a thumbs down because of the bugs and errors that make the game at time completely unplayable if i claim some land in my world in game and suddenly cant see the blocks that i am placing cant see the blocks that i removed because they still appear to be there for a build game that is the worst i tamed like twenty pets set them to stay yet they all vanish above or below the area they were set to stay or they end up all together in one area that is awful im not sure if it show my gametime but it is nine hundred and twentynine hours writing this nine hundred and twenty hours were all played completely free i was playing this game since two thousand and sixteen when it was in early access and recorded some gameplay and even did some live streams unfortunately i made the mistake of purchasing pro in october twenty eighteens during the halloween sale and havent really played the game since why you ask all the problems i said above i dont want to support a company that lies in october their companyplayful corp had a artwork contest and wrote rules to the contest only to break them and in the process exclude those that met all the written rules i will not support a companyplayful corp that lies and refuses to admit and correct the problem of a contest the company held playful corp i will not be buying any of your future products ladies and gentlemen please take a look at the screenshot proof that proves they are liars i have underlined circled and numbered it i rest my case in this very obvious open and shut case that they are guilty of this https steamcommunity id1564440251sure i also give a suggestion for a possible solution to fix and correct the problem and here are more award two more or how about fifteen more playfulcorp seems to refuse and ignore a month and a weeks worth or asking for public response to why do this so how will playful corp stop doing this when some say they have done it in past contests it is real simple and i will tell everyone dont call them contests if they are just giveaways with no rules all you would have to say is enter this giveaway at this time and it ends when winners get announced then an option to share artwork or a build or something else that is suggested by playfulcorp do that then no problems ever enter optional

early access reviewgood game a little bugs in cliffs and mountains ak47s dissapear on the ground cant change hair colour and no eu server it has much to improve and very similar to pubg mobile
early access reviewone of my favorite games on steam extremely fun to turn on whenever there are friends over couch party is awesome and theres not much more i could ask from this game
just a gimped down mobile version of yugioh buggy and not worth your time the tutorials ingame arrive too late and only belittle anyone playing this only compounds on the fact that they are part of the progression in game furthermore you have new levels of rarity like super rare and ultra rare their rarity often tied to how useful or good a card is this in turn gimps the game for anyone who hasnt played a while limited deck slots is also a thing that is forced on the player fullscreen is not enabled by default the gui is designed for a mobile phone and you often have terrible lag between menus and actions lastly even the gameplay mechanics are gimped there is no mainphase two for example i could go on but you get the jist dont waste your time
major memory leak problem with trove 60fps will drop to 15fps on a 970gtx and multi gpu ive tested trion wont do anything to fix this problem they just want you to buy more credits and dont care to fix anything
early access reviewdied to a no armor guy riding around in a truck and got panned when i shot him five times with full hp and full armor with a semi shotgun and that was after i got hit markers on him with the ak fortyseven in the truck and he still killed me so either lag or some hacker either way fix the pan and the game woud be fun
my points are all first impressions the good things about this game no gender lock classes7 different races so farcharacter creationthe bad things about this game sluggish movementcamera is annoyingcombat is terribleinstants world in two thousand and eighteen
it is a pay to play game even though it says free to play you can only get a few guns without using real money overall if it wasnt pay to play i would give it a seven hundred and ten i dont recommend this game unless you want to spend money on it
early access reviewpros decent character customization i really liked the fact you can tame pretty much anythingcons where do i begin graphics are not up to par with what i expected yes its an older engine but the world just looked so bland and boring unoptimized fps was way below what it should be for the computer i had as a founder my rewards were locked to the first character i created also you can only create four characters per server on top of that i was forced into a faction content that was promised was not released ie end game i was also getting drops for classes that they had said they would release at a later date everything felt too easy you could solo the first two dungeons you could autopath to every quest npcarea while this might be fine for a game like bdo where there is no flight path to anything this game has multiple fast travel methods poor translation of skills notifications you are now 11level attack for twentysix and make gain one rage i felt that given this game has been out six years the level of polish in this game was not up to par it just felt clunky and unrefined and i did try multipe classes and found it the same tldr i had low expecations and it still didnt meet those expecations i paid for the deluxe edition ninety three cdn and thankfully i was able to get a refund i will maybe give this a try later on when they i dunno actually finish creating the game
early access review this is bob copy and paste him so he can take over the workshop
access reviewgame got destroyed by patching and try to evolve a good game into a bad game also removing classes and adding bots this game is no special anymore then every other batttle royal classes feel useless and everything feels cluncky bring the game back to the alpha stage and you will earn way more money then actually from this state of this game
early access reviewi spent so many hours with this masterpiece making a vary types of things including but not limited to a bird a flying ship from treasure planet star wars xfighters and many more this game is like a minecraft but with an ability to create a robotsvehicles and destroy other players creationsi will give this one thousand and ten for sure whats better yet this a truely a free pvp games there is no p2w of such sort its all depends on your creations
basically counterstrike but with more wizards more russians and less teamwork also similar to lol1010 would play any of these champs againupdate would you look at that they even added wukong now and moved baron to the correct side of the map good job riot
business tour online multiplayer board gamethis game be quite fun with a group of friends the game does have some bugs such as were a player lags and teleports around or moves to a wrong space but overall its a fun game i wish it was more similar to monopoly but overall its a good game for being free
now i understand why people are spamming bad game this one is unplayable on a laptop graphicly is way to early optimisation is maybe less combat is clunky i do not recommend such a game ill never try playing it again
early access reviewrobocraft was a super fun and promizing game it gave you a lots of creative freedom with your builds but robocraft is no longer fun after its last update it took away the feeling of progression by making everything p2w the people who are willing to pay for it will win the game by having all the late game unlocksthat anyone just can pay for now on their build all the tons of ingame currency that i had worked my butt of to get is now deleted and all i had saved up for i could no longer afford and now i wont ever be able to cratesp2wpremium a game pay to win is the worst decicion a game dev can make and its not even finished yet i feel so sorry robocraft suffered a premature death rip youll be missed
played the game during pre release and it was pretty fun now i cant play with it without an incredibly boring intro cinematic followed by a uselessly long and unskippable tutorial mission which i do not need wanted to blow my brains out after ten minutes dropped out of tutorial to avoid certain suicide will play when i can skip
if you are going to spend real money or a good amount of time in this game save your savegames by yourself or you will one day maybe lose everything like me your entire vault will be gone and you will have to start from zero you ask why because the savegamesystem is garbage wouldnt recommend such a horrible experience but if you are goint to play this you now know what to do
trove was a good game you can play this very well without paying any real world money buy nowsince the last few patchesthis game is not friendly to the new players you need more
one of the better f2p entries on the market for certain the devs take such an antip2w stance that im actually really amazed and tempted to spend money since the games not a black hole vortex for it like most f2p arpgs have really been done to death and most really arent that different from one another but i feel path of exile really stands out due to a number of innovative approaches to old problems levelling and screwing yourself and worthless currencies in particular i can genuinely say that i like character progression better than diablo ii its still doesnt capture the holy crap moments of diablo ii loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either but it sure as hell does both of those better than the cancer that is diablo 3only thing i hate is server lag the fanboy crew irrationally blame peoples internet but its clearly the games server it only happens occasionally but when it does its at a level high enough to be quite frustrating
access reviewthe game has massive potential and is a lot of fun but its privacy policy is disgusting i advise everyone to actually read it before installing and for this reason this gets a bad review from me
two words spawn campingi give it a two hundred and ten the game itself is rather fun maybe a seven hundred and ten game with room for improvement on the few games that all players are doing the usual dogfights and bombing runs but every now and then you will run into a clan who has the exact spawn locations marked and they will b line straight to it and for the next five minutes your team will absolutely not be able to get a plane out the spawn camping in this game is entirely game has completely destroyed it take my word and just steer clear the game isnt good enough to justify retaining such an incredibly outdated playstyle
the game is getting more and more pay to win no matter how good or long you played they put more and more op cards you can only pay to get story mode is really cool but the core game is now unplayable even low rank now exploit because they easily can no matter what those twenty twenty hours playtime the guru wanabes and git gud trolls are saying on the community forums those ez win cards i couldnt manage to get after all my playtime since i used the in game money to play the story story which btw i yet didnt fully unlock yes i only played half the paytoaccess part of the game after two hundred and fifty hours and now i cant even manage to beat the crushing op cards i tend to always see when i want to play the base game i had a great time playing this game feels like long ago but it is now unfun and unfair i gave this game more chances to entertain me but he is now really too disappointing
early access reviewi think people are highly going overboard with the negative reviews the games still in early accessstill being added to and adjusted and some how in twelve days people think they know everything about it and that its problems will never get fixed firstly i must say out of all the early access games ive played in the last few years this has been one of the better ones if not the best only one or two maitenances on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day roughly about two hours all in all it was down for on the first night for maitenances so i think its doing fine the game itself is quite fun theres a bunch of things to do nothing that hasnt been done before but still a variety and it doesnt feel like a massive chore the combat is fun for a tab target game the combo system makes it interesting i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a a buttonmash fest and you have to think about what your using and how to utilise the stances to get the most of possible the problems atm are quite normal for any recently released mmo and i can deal with that it will get better with time only problem i have which is just a preference is that some classes i want to play arent out mostly assassin but thats not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out another issue i would like to pick up on though this failed in other regions and is a old game according to some its been tweaked quite a bit for us and they keep on tweaking it just have patience i still feel like it has promise and i hope people give it a go because neowiz are actually really trying as a company to live up to what people here want which is suprising since i cant think of many companies who would actually go to the lengths they did to make this build of the game for us it is similar but at the same time very different to the other builds it has in other regions i hope it has a steady success and helps people remember what mmos are for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it pvppve or other
as an experimental gamer i found this game quite fun however there is one key issue with the game that everyone will experience the current issue at hand is lag i dont know where the servers are located but if you and a friend play this game expect it there will be moments where you will get disconnected when entering a portal moments when you will stand there and wait a minute before actually accessing the portal seeing as how this is the only piece of uncertainty to not download this game i would definatly reccomend the game because ive been playing it for a week straight nonstop those of you with any questions or concerns go ahead and drop a comment on my profile if i find this question reasonable i will add you and discuss it
do not install this gamemy account was hacked and banned for botting support refuses to investigate unable to appeal will never be able to play thanks to support staff
i downloaded this game thirteen hours ago i have eleven hours on this game at the time of writing this review i think i have my new addiction it is totally worth playing especially as its free although i did have to wait a while to log on to start with the wait was definitely worth it cubeworld 20tis fancy
early access reviewin the short time i played this game me and my friends noticed factory is a rip off of dust two from counter strike global offensive also the engine has a critical issue of lag when you press a button on mouse or keyboard there is an extreme delay between the button being pressed and what actually happens on screen also the maps are spawn trap city please update the spawn system in this game we were able to spawn trap very easily these are game breaking issues that need to be addressed and for the fact that they copied dust two is just the last straw
worst matchmaking in a moba ive seen for a long time chance that you find normal teammates is equal to zero and for your dismay enemy team is allways full of fully mastered gods and propably madlifes if you want to play go only coop because normals are going to kill your sanity quicker than league or csgo and even dota two
its quite laggy and sometimes your dragon will disapearalso it doesnt fit your screen resolution and you cant exit without alt tab the clicking exit its a waste of space for thirteen gb so dont waste your time and space for it
este juego es y sera uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado y jugare nunca debido a que tiene graficos bastante buenosy no necesitas gran cosa para correrlos bienmucha variedad de vehiculoslos desarrolladores del juego estan muy activos y actualizan el juego a veces sea repetitivola comunidad de este juego es bastante amigabley para mi siendo de habla española hay muchos clanes a los que unirmeno obstante hay veces en las que puedes llegar a frustrate por diversas razones pero eso no quita que siga siendo uno de mis favorios y es gratuito asi que si no lo has descargado todavia dale una oportunidad no hay nada que perder
early access reviewthis game is good but it has a few bugs what i enjoyed was the fact that it reminded me about the 2d version and that it uses pretty much the same maps what i didnt like its inventory just didnt work so i would say it should be fixed it has been a month or two since i have played it so hopefully they fix the bug
early access reviewthis might really be the end of artix entertainment why make this ugly looking 3d game aqw had an enormous fan base they had good 2d artists and they got a lot of money mostly because of appearance items aqw was good but outdated they just had to spice the mechanics a bit perhaps making a turn based game like wakfudofus would be the best solution but no lets make an amateur 3d modeled game focused for mobile users eveyones gonna love that ideaartix entertainment what where you thinking
after thirtyone hours of playing i lost my save the game froze and my laptop with it after relaunching i was greeted with no vault only the possibility to create a new one i read that this is common amongst players long ago so i dont understand why doesnt the team do something with the problem disappointed
i like this game because it is fun to play with freinds and can make me smile when ime bored for me it still doesnt beat monopoly but because of the time it takes to play it can be more practical that and its free i have founed when playing online with other people it can be frustrating when someone goes afk because you have to wait for the timer to run out on their player i wouldnt mind if this happened a few times if it happens twice then the player should be kicked from the game but anymore than a few waits is annoying this isnt a problem when playing with freinds another problem i have founed is that you must have the game fully loaded in before joining a freinds game or it will crash the game these are the only problems i have founed i would recommend this game to anyone wanting something fun to do with freinds
this game is really just an arcade shooter that a bunch of people can play at the same time dont go in expecting a lot of opportunities for interaction or anything other than the most basic features of an mmorpg slightly disappointing because the general concept was such a great idea but hopefully theyll be adding new content in the future in the meantime its just fun enough to warrant giving it a try plus its free with a cash shop that doesnt ruin the game
early access reviewi did recommend it but now i don t recommend this game to nobody seems like eighty of the people playing uses hacks and trust me they will destroy your experience it s a shame that such company doesnt seems to invest enough in protecting this game from hacks if you don t trust me start playing and take a look on how many impossible circumstances other players will kill you take a look at youtube youll find an immense number of hacks for it would like to receive my money back if possible because it s very unfair waste it this way
what has happened to the game i once knew and loved me and my best friend were searching for some games to play we got bored of tf2 and found trove at the time you had to download the glyph client in order to play but we didnt mind we played a lot had so much fun and i had that much fun that i got ahead of my best friend by a lot then shadow towers got introduced to the game and it was fun to battle to titan bosses i would always be one of the last players standing with my endgame dracolyte then it all changed the game i once knew and loved vanished it became a grinding game where the p2w players would most of the time have the upper hand classes became pay to get and their reason was to make players feel different from others it pretty much didnt change anything i wouldnt have minded but the developers are the most laziest the servers are most of the items are community created right now they keep on doing the same events do some quests get a reward that isnt worth it and the amount you had to farm for it was just dumb i have around one thousands hours experience and i can say that i wish they could just revert back to the beta and the new players think they are so smart saying t like the game is not p2w it is not bad and keep on arguing if they were here in the beta they would have known why we even starter an argument about the the game is seriously trion world if you wish to become a better company you can start by fixing the load of bugs you have some that are still here and have since the beta and get rid of most of the p2w
after years of playing this game since two thousand and twelve i have finally grown some interest in writing this review and i want to start by saying if you havent played this game already just do do it its a free game and its unique you wont find similar experience it is intense it is heavy combat it shreds your pc in half because of so much happening at the same time and has people using their mics with battlecry and warsongs you will die a lot its the dark souls of mmo you will die but yet you will feel happy because of so much fighting take your time to enjoy the game dont try to rush things and get bored quickly dont base your opinion on the game on others play it and you will discover for sure that there is still great potential in a six year old game its the only game that can hook me up for an entire day of battle also findind a good outfit is a must have for one hundred enjoyement inside the game and also to have someone to teach you things planetside2 has a lot of problems but those problems dont take the light out of the game go out there and fight for auraxisricardo23
early access reviewoverall its a good game that is free who can complain about that right good gameplay with a decent community can grind out any and all items ingame so it is most definitely not a pay to win starting off isnt the most pleasant experience but once you get a decent gun the game improves tremendously the new upcoming gbuild is going to change the game quite a bit with reto dev revamping all the maps with new buildings and layouts i think itll work out nicely but only time will tell
early access reviewimmensely fun and enjoyable better than most br games in my opinion malware rumors are rumors and will be rumors ive looked into every claim into my pc no such thing happening probably just fortnite fans afraid of losing value of their accounts
early access reviewthis is probably the most dissapointing game ive played the old game its so different it could easily be a different game had fun challenging gameplay but now theyve scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play this includes overpowered weapons that one shot new players impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all premiums get twice as many items from crates as nonpremiums playing in a match with a premium doesnt give you additional money like it used to i could go on for hours the largest problem ive encountered is players attaching a really op weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players matches meaning that theyll always win and gain easy loot this mainly occurs with the new aeroflak cannon which in early games destroys any ground targets even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun secondly the insane cost of items so you play a match come first in the team and win gaining a protonium crate and gain some stuff you dont want so you sell it and gain maybe three hundred money now you want to buy something oh wait you cant because even the cheapest gun costs four hundred and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases so you play another match but theres someone with an aeroflak by the way did i mention that the aeroflak costs seventy five thousand to buy but thats not even the most expensive item there is the lock on rocket launcher another commonly used cheat weapon costs one hundred and twenty five thousand to buy and i bet that leaves you wondering but how do i get that well the sad answer is you dont or at least without spending more money anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find some more junk this has basically described what the game feels like for nonpremiums but wait what if you are a premium well other than costing a ton of money a single day costs one it is very good access to all the paints yes thats only for premiums twice the items from crates custom profile pic ect all of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just dont care enough anymore to change it theyve gotten too greedy with money to think is this a good fun game one hundred and ten huge dissapointment
i know im only eight hours here but im well over one hundred on ps4just wanted to comment about how im sure the new tower has helped with the flow of the game but i dont like what its done for the feel of the game or the farm for cosmetics i liked being able to drop into a power level range and see all sorts of different types of biomes instead of just having the biomes correlate to certain power level ranges like they do now its a lot more fun if i can grind stuff that i want to grind thats relevant to my level while mostly staying in biome types i want to playneed cosmetics from if im missing something please someone let me know
early access reviewi started playing a few days after release it was phenomenal realm royale rr has the best br concept it brings shooters and mmos together within a br universe the class aspect is not even its biggest selling point it was notice past sense the concept incentive to hunt other players players would drop currency to craft better weaponsgear unfortunately there were a couple of poor choices the games current state is too rng focused despite the fact elements were added that already were reverted the first time they chose to add them the direction of this game is not clear what is clear is that the playerbase gets smaller after every poorly chosen change this game has the potential to be very very big i guess we will have to wait for blizzard to create a br where classes are a thing
early access reviewits actually very fun and the guns system is unique no p2w hope divs keep developing one thing i hated is that i opened the golden box like six times and i only got the stupid smoke grenade d
if you played andor play the normal yugioh card game i do not recommend this its a sad immitation dont get me wrong its oddly enjoyable i mean i put in six hours into it and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then thirty minutes but its not something i can take seriously min play rankedclassic battle always disconnect and ask me to reboot fix your connection error issue on pvp konami no balanced pvp bronze rank vs gold rank are u kidding me konamito many card buy card must use diamond or trade so for what there is goldand last i have played many different yugioh this one has many card included so it could be nice but with just three spaces each for monsters and spelltrap cards this just ruins the game the game is meant to be played with many monsters effects and spells trap cards in play and three spaces each just doesnt cut it maybe they would change it later but now it is just boring to bad
early access reviewive just gotten the game this last week and as much as i love it i cant help feel theres a massive imbalance going down i mean im only a lvl two dont laugh and im being pitted against players that have lasers that slice through your dam ship they seem to zip across the battle space lol no wonder im getting a kicking i guess this just means ill have to buckle up keep upgrading though im sure noobs such as myself can be pitted with a matching class however all being said i still love the game will keep upgrading you can also spend cash to help speed shti up from what ive seen there are a few playing it like this and if you like to stay ahead then you will have to spend a little cash getting there though you could still play for free if you wanted great graphics excellent scenes wicked sounds great space battles
early access reviewi have been looking for something like hearthstone and i believe i have found it in this game there have been some comments about not getting the right cards at the beginning but a redrw usually gets me in the right direction the artwork is nice and there is a nice story to follow that upon completing each battle you get cards it seems to be a bit more complicated thatn hearthstone but in a good way you really have to think ahead rather since the opponant can choose to defend or not overall a very nice game which i plan to continue playing for quite a while also although it is indeed completly f2p and one could play this without spending a dime there is a nice two hundred and ninety nine that gets you three packs and a load of gems i find that to be a nice small puchase that supports the game but doesnt commit a ton of money very much worth the two hundred and ninety nine
it has its moments its not exactly the best thing that ever hit steam its a little buggy and they want you to pay for everything but looking past that its alright partial thumbs up
early access reviewits cute yes for the most part and things jump out at you from the walls cardboard cutouts in fact but when you start to be chased by things and then up pops something in front of you it really does make you jump and than laugh and then run away again from whatever is following you recommended for anyone who wants a heart attack
wow has a better subcription model than this game want to hunt any given animal you see fifteen bucks a year get into the game with the idea of being an evil poacher and shooting all of the deer game says you cant shoot that god says no0110 worst payment model ever which then ruins the rest of the game
update game or bring the old game back very simple fixes i must say from my personal development expierence no reason why you should be ignoring your supporters not saying you are but its starting to feel that way im recomending this game as a means of support because i wanna see a good free survival mmo like this could be in the future please
it might be a good program if the key bindings didnt randomly stop working if it didnt randomly refuse to boot up and if it didnt randomly and repeatedly seem to introduce bugs into itself maybe it worked for vista but its rubbish under win ten
early access reviewused to be a great game until the epic loot update completely destroyed it there is now zero progression its all rng through loot crates weapons are completely unbalanced and the economy has been totally ruined shame on you freejam for going down the moneygrabbing route to all newcomers stay away from this game until they hopefully fix it or revert back before this latest update
well theres some good and some bad that came out of this the good is that i can completely disassemble and reassemble a tec9 blindfolded with one hand but the bad is the tec9 is essentially useless because it jams more often then a smuckers factory
early access reviewabandon all hope ye who installs this wretch with the addition of the epic loot update things have gotten quite when a match ends you get a stupid crate which may or may not give you something thats worth a damn you can sell those items for about one thousand and twenty of their actual price thank god they didnt keep the insane multimillion price tags for some of the stuff because the most common item youll be getting is lowtier gadgets and blocks neither of which are worth a lot gun energy seems to be whacked being unable to shoot with more than half of the energy bar left is annoying at best and infuriating at worst the devs care little of their game and their players and instead resort to petty excuses and dismissing reviews like this one and comments as boring weapons are not balanced especially considering the lag compensation system is not going to help you how do you like getting shot through mountains the screenshots on the store page are deceptive and are not up to date for instance the medic gun which looks like it shoots continuous beams does not do damage anymore the worst part about the game though is the playerbase while it is true that they have complained about many things that really werent all that important that is not what makes them bad some people say that the players are actually better than those in lol or dota two but do not be fooled the players here are victims of a lobotomy gone horribly wrong you will face teammates that are insanely incompetent making you wonder if they have ever touched a computer before you will rarely be matched with halfdecent or even good teammates your teammates will let enemies drive by them without as much as noticing them they will fail to assist you they will always have extreme tunnel vision in short they will always fail it is insanely infuriating to see them fail at the most simple of things like you know shooting the enemy thats in front of thembut this is just an early access game ofcourse people are going to hate the updatesheres the question how long does it take for a game to establish its ideas its vision its identity five years ten years i think not for a game as simple as this staying in alpha for so long is simply shameful the game had atleast two total makeovers to my knowledge how much longer does this alpha stage need to go on as long as the excuse can be abused the removal of tiers the tech tree the megabots some people were not too happy with it i wasnt too thrilled myself but i persevered epic loot update im afraid i cant care any longer especially when the devs throw around passiveaggressive comments about their playerbase take the review as you will abandon all hope ye who installs this wretch
not much to say about this game you can play on most computers doesnt matter how bad it is if you liked the games like super smash bros ect than you need to download this gamethe controls are easy to get the the hang of usually no lag what so ever there are many legends to pick from and even buy within game currency if you like weekly rotations are a very good aspect edit unbalanced af talking hammer and axe recommend this game to anyone
this game is simply cheating players a bit is to extract as much money as possible strange card matching adjustable ranking games with the strongest decks against yours total lack of balance where the card simply wins the gamethe worst thing is that the game is set so that when you buy new boosters you get the cards in such a way that they are not random only allocated topdown review the progress of the number of cards in the profile the game was done to make money not for players satisfaction remember this when you spend money on itplaying to one victory is a complte failure the one who gets the cards better wins lack of sideboard game reduces to random card matching and the total lack of the opportunity to prepare for the opponent i understand the mtg clone requires new solutions after all thirty years of magic is a poor experience to show how the game should lookbalance game is zeroall tactics and satrategy die in pain in one turn when the opponent throws a card that is bent which itself destroys the whole gamethe authors consider themselves great creators to create cards that play themselvesyou like frustration and pain i invite you to play you prefer to play tactically and think play paper stone scissors there is more thinking there
very good game it feels and plays just like dayz dayz minus the brilliant zombie a i and advanced game mechanics this game has everything except dayzs best bits the endless running and bugs that is where the game shines ten minutes of running followed by a crash to desktop i would gladly pay two hundred smackaroos for this free to play heap of fresh manure play it now
after seven hundred and twenty if you dont play the meta characters right now you wont win team comps at higher levels look well rounded towards the bottom tiers they whole team needs to be carries and only metacarries the majority of players are low tier so this is most of the players experiece the recent buff to certain characters make some supports onehit killers late game and other broken i used to think this game was better than league because the various build paths and play styles but it seems like you must go a certain path to win games and only that path if you want to play various characters that might not be meta and still have a shot at winning dont play this version of dota two go play league or another moba that is growing this game doesnt satisfy like it used to and by the way theyve been making changes it doesnt look like it will change in a better direction soon uninstall and come back a couple years later
product received for freewere going to war time to grab the bicycle11010jkthe comment above was just a joke but this game does have problems which the devs in most cases are not dealing with instead the only thing they seem to be doing is adding more things to grind for nothing else to enjoy this game you have to grind or pay i have put eight hundred and six hours into this game biggest mistake ever and i still dont have everything i would ideally want the thing which is sad about this game is that as a concept it had so much potential and i think for the most part that is why i put so many hours into the game just because i always thought at some point this game might get better but now after all these years i cant say the game is worth the time and yes i know someone will end up saying it s free to play the only thing i can say to that is it is not you pay for the stuff you want with money or time i made the stupid decision i dont want to give the game a rating or anything but i hope this helps
"early access reviewfun game that has a bit of a learning curve very small player base usually only about sixty thousand, one hundred and ten people on at anytime never had a wait to play though just saw a lot of the same names up to you wether thats good or bad most ships play very differently and you have to adjust your playstyle to match otherwise youll have a bad time good communication with devs and they regularly release updates for the game"
"this game is absolutely amazing this is definitely a game that would fall under the clickeridle category though when i think about it it seems like an exact five thousand and fifty between the two im really enjoying this game and have already gotten addicted i havent played the fallout series so i cant call myself a longtime fallout fan or anything but ive heard the fallout series is amazing and this is definitely a great game and by great developers ten million, eleven thousand d"
early access reviewi have been apart of this game since well before it came to steam i have seen well not much improvement they continue to add shinny items but fail to fix the glaringly broken ones frequent crashes funky ui zero clan system broken and unblanced weapons wonky maps buggy vehicles weapons and terrain it seems with the last build this game is looking for whales they want players to come in and dump tons of real cash to advance be warned this game is a huge grind it will take you years to advance a toon years unless ofcourse you want to spend tons of real cash on it every new build brings new bugs and inbalance do not waste your time here folks for new players you will think its all great until you hit level three or five then you will see how screwed up the game really is three years running now and its still in beta the engine is old and looks like bf1942 the video on the store page are not the real graphics but an embelished version dont do it folks read all the recent reviews we the player base are saying the same thing over and over
early access reviewthe game is really good for an alpha i noticed most last negative reviews are from people that don t understand what an alpha is ill give a more in depth review when they ll stop deploying big changes every weeks and the game enter beta
fallout with sim theme tower reminds me of goldenage bullfrog games with a dash of maxis and a bethesda topping you cant go wrong its more of a mobilebackground game than anything else though it was developed as a mobile game meant to be played in short bursts and its totally a one thousand and ten at that
early access reviewi have a lot hours in this game and i think i can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game also the review im giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competively than casually lets start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldnt be in here seventyfive card decks the decks that you make have to be seventyfive cards instead of the standard sixty that are common in most other games this makes deckbuilding and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare there are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game and trust me i built them but with seventyfive cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced the deck size should be sixty cards and then you have a fifteen card side board though sideboards dont matter in this game either and ill explain later mulligan doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb in this game if you dont like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause youre stuck with it let me give you an example of how it should be if you ever played magic the gathering another better card game before the way their system works is like this you start with seven cards if you dont like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six if you still dont like your hand you can go down to four cards if you still dont like your hand you can go down to three though this never happens etc etc the point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason coin flip normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you have to go first now in other games when you do a coin flip the winner has the option if they want to go first or not i know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first it doesnt happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to this is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesnt trust their player base to make their own decisions best out of one this is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore for some reason ranked matches are a best of one basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank sometimes in games you are bound to get unluckly with draws but thats why in most other cards games when you play competively you play your opponent the best of three for the life of me i have no idea why the game is like this i cant begin to tell you how absoultely frustated you will feel when you are playing ranked and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you cant cause eternal only allows two for some reason and you wind up losing the game cause of it but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up its absoultley ridculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competive play unbalanced cards some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken and by that i mean you essentially have no way to lose some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essientially has no way to win the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first ive played tons of other card games before magic hearthstone yugioh pokemon and i can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards ive ever seen drafing sucks finally the last point that i want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game for drafting in eternal you arent drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here these drafts arent with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is fortyfive cards this isnt as much of a big deal since you draft fortyeight cards in total but i just find it odd also draft matches are not the best out of three they are again the best out of one its so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it so if you get awful hands well too bad f you cause now you lose the match here is the good things about eternal its free and it will only take you fifty hours of grinding to get a semi good deck if you dont want to spend money overall if you are looking for a card game to play online to take more seriously just go play hearthstone magic online or magic arena

a negative review on duel links from someone with fifty hours in the game on steam alone who has created a community guide and logged over one hundred and twenty consecutive days in the past year on the mobile version blasphemyyeah i know but let me explain myself before you crucify me duel links isnt a bad game in fact its a great game that ive loved playing and that ive enjoyed from day one despite the microtransactions and sometimes unforgiving meta duel links has been arguably the best yugioh game ever made and konami has shown dedication to both supporting its players and to regularly updating the game with fresh and exciting content as a whole i applaud konami and what theyve managed to accomplish in the year since duel links global release this review isnt about the quality of the game though rather its about my personal experiences playing duel links religiously for a year and why ive decided to take a step back from the game going forward long story short i think ive been addicted i mean it when i said ive played this game religiously thats the attitude that both the game and the community promote if you want to stay in the competitive scene and keep up with the constant barrage of new cards being added to the game you are regularly encouraged to log on daily spending a couple hours here and there to grind for xp and reach the max level with your duelists which is the main way to earn the in game gem currency needed to buy more cards youll spend hours autodueling npcs while pretending you can focus on other tasks in between when really your mind is preoccupied with how youll soon have to queue up your next duel and how much longer itll take you to reach the next level or stage i got into this game because i loved yugioh as a kid and the idea of a free to play mobile game that was regularly updated and supported felt exciting and nostalgic beyond words but i never expected to spend almost every day of the past year playing this game or logging in for over one hundred and twenty days straight or how i would soon make excuses to play duel links when hanging out with my friends or going on coffee dates or even when just relaxing on the couch with my girlfriend when the game is always in reach your phone always nearby it becomes so easy to log on to check on the cooldown on standard duelists or to find yourself playing yet another pvp duel people around me starting complaining saying i was on my phone all the time but i insisted it wasnt a problem and that i was still present and engaged in the conversations that would go on around me even if it wasnt fully the truth at work at school at home on the bus i played everywhere anywhere but venturing onto the duel links subreddit a few weeks back i discovered that i wasnt alone in struggling to balance my time spent on duel links with my everyday life and responsibilities so many other people have had these issues and multiple threads have been created to try and seek help from other players who didnt even know they shared these problems duel links had become more than a daily routine for me and these posts were a wakeup call i had a problem im still kind of taken aback by the whole experience and im not expecting everyone here to understand but as someone whos played video games all their life i never thought a game could have the kind of hold on me that duel links has i felt compelled to open the game daily i had to so that i would continue my log in streak so that i could continue to earn more gems so that i could feel like i was keeping up with other players i hesitate to use the word addicted but my duel links habit had become downright unhealthy sunday was the first day in one hundred and twentythree that i did not log in to duel links it was a normal quiet afternoon i went to starbucks lounged around the house played overwatch on my ps4 it wasnt until after midnight had passed that i realized i hadnt played duel links in twentyfour hours and the understanding that my streak had ended and that i didnt have to log in every day anymore if i didnt want to was cathartic beyond words i know that not everyone will experience duel links the same way or the way that i have im not going to stop playing altogether either i meant what i said about duel links being the best yugioh game on the market and ive met some amazing people in the community that ive bonded with over our ridiculous shared love for a childrens card game but since you cant leave a neutral review on steam i have to give it a thumbs down if just for the regret i feel knowing how much of the past year i spent glued to my phone this isnt meant to discourage anyone from playing duel links and as ive said i highly recommend this game but please please be aware of how much time you spend on the game and dont let it impact other areas of your life the way it impacted mine its okay to believe in the heart of the cards just dont let them consume you
with the recent patches made to this game tier four is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against that is no the worst part anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than fifty it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to as i said the devs are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic they also do not listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and gaijin have firmly stated they are staying the censoring has gotten worse they have been threatening youtubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted this is a complete violation of youtubes copyright system after the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtuber who brought to light cheats people were using not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down this is yet again more abuse of youtubes system and is also gaijin using their own community for personal gain do not play take a stand against the devs and show them that this will not be tolerated and cannot be forgiven
first impression is always important and i do not know how this game is since i cannot even start it spent good amount of time searching the official forum and reddit wt forum to fix this problem and did all that i could to launch this game could be some technical issues or could be its just badly made now i am regediting to remove any trace of gaijin agent after deleting this game

this is the first review i have ever written so i dont do this for no reason this game has a lot of potential i can feel that this could be a good game but its not as it is now the game auto levels you and chooses your skills which i very much dislike the game lags terribly in the main city which is normal in most mmos due to the population the difference here is i was lagging a lot but i didnt even see any other players the combat is very linear in the sense you hit a button and just follow the skill chain button mashing at its finest i looked in the cash shop and it looks very pay to win at end game honestly it was just sort of boring and with the lagging and the fact i didnt see a single other player its just not fun so i do not reccomend this game however if you feel the need to play it im sure youll make up your mind within the first hour of playing that it should be deleted from your computer and sent to the recycle bin where it belongs sorry bless folks but this game needs a ton of work before it will be playable
after a strong year with several updates that improved the game considerably the developers have decided to worsen the already rough grind by substantially increasing the credit cost for new soldiers why they think this is a positive change for anyone i have no idea in the end its a great game ruined by its userhostile monetization model and this is why i cannot recommend it anymore your money or time is better spent elsewhere

early access review810very fun gamepros have to progress and learn as you goalot of graphicsgreat multiplayercons monsters can be a little toughfinding certain materials can be a challengecould have more of a tutorial for certain materials and how to find themover all its an amazing game downloaded it with my brother and friend played six hours straight it is now four fourteen am and i need to try and get some sleep
i can not open the game is asking for a code that was to be inserted when i opened the game for the first time someone help me when i click cd key he says failed to contact key server
i will keep playin this game but i do not recommend itwhy you ask its cringy af not balancedneeds grind requires more time than my gf and i do not have oneit is easier to buy the fckin cards for your deck in real life
i like this game its fun and it works for players who cant run the actal world of tanks i also like that i dont need to buy modules so i can have up to the millions of credits well enough to buy four rounds or premium ammo i have in all tanks that can have it and to buy all three slots of camo povisions and consumables so people saying its pay to win are incorrect
getting the game to properly recognize my controller and map it properly was too difficult ui needs a major overhaul to make navigation easier too many ui gimics and not enough function
early access reviewhow ironic cuisine royale in the short amount of time it has been out is the culmination of the ideal battle royale game that pubg wants to be performancewise cr transcends pubg clocking in at buttery tripledigit frames for ample midtier pc builds my heart races as i hear clanking pots and pans signifying imminent lifeordeath scenarios do i leave the duck to spoil or do i eliminate my nearing rival in hopes of salvaging his coveted cookware cuisine royale pushes your mind and stomach past their respective limits and youre going to learn the hard way when that heat gets out of the kitchen and into warfare see you on the battlefield chef
early access reviewthis game its so charming and cute atleast for the first part of the game its a very satirical game and it knows how to be satirical perfectly and best of all its absolutely freeeeee
early access reviewbrawlhalla is the perfect example of a platform fighter in my opinion in the state that it is now i can see it rivaling smash bros in the future this game shines and for it being a soon to be free to play game that makes it better
early access reviewthe game is good but however i spend some money on random box there but mostly i get gold soo this is the only issue they should remove gold at least from the boxs
its too damn addicting i have a life things to do goals to achieve i cant keep just checking on it every second to see it i can get another twentyfive on my main dps or when a mission is done do not play this game if you want to do anything in life apart from playing it
to edit right now i have about fifteen million four million on parts in my inventory i can buy anything i want but its just not rewarding the general experience is just crap cause there barely is one the mechanics are okay the visuals could have been nicer there used to be skill now its just noskill spamming do youself a favor and dont play this piece of used to be really nice but i no longer like it the many updates ruined this gametech tree gonegetting money without having to pay goneintroduction to crates lootsucks
"early access reviewjust going to throw this out there first off some reviews are actually corret after reading about a page or two of reviews i decided to try it regardless thinking it might be a knockoff battlefield one thousand, nine hundred and forty two and it kind of is in some sense it was fun at first until you reach rank three and then it all changes it turns into a completely pay two win game you do not stand a chance if you do not own tanks planes pilots tank crew men along with antitank vehicle weapons maybe it was just me trying to stay loyal and play with only my us troop when germany is clearly stacked and gets a lot more benefits in the war such as two spawning points more lives and their guns seem slightly better in general all in all i give this game a 25it has had a lot of potential but as most f2p fps games it falls on p2w in the end or really in the near start so enjoy your rank three trial then dont bother unless youve got money to throw away"
early access reviewthis game is garbage its like playing counter strike on a nintendo sixty four its horrible guns have terrible damage its not very polished it buggy and boring as hell to play
i put over four hundred hours into this game now and honestly my opinion of it has only grown over the years when i first purchased this game as a early access i felt very let down they would wipe stats every few weeks and give us nothing for testing it out however after offical release when the game went free to play they gave us a ton of cool skins and stuff and made up for it positives this game is not pay to winanyone can obtain premium currency they give out their premium currency like its candy you can buy any of the ships with premium currency but its wasteful better spent on skins because eventually your gonna have so many credits you dont know what to do with them the game play is very fun the only disadvantage newer players have is there skill level this game is very similar to leaque of legends in that case negatives the learning curve is not terrible however you are likely to spend your first hundread hours grinding for ships you want to try out i recommend you watch all of the ship tutorial videoshttps www youtube comwatch the game is still a work in progress even today they are often making changes to gameplay and reblancing shipsinclusion i would recommend the game it is a ton of fun and i still enjoy it every time i play it there is nothing more satisfying than winning a one v one or getting twenty kills and no deaths i do not recommend playing for wins you will only become sad d no matter what your going to lose some games but you can find joy in the combat it self or focus more towards your personal stats in the game
early access reviewdont spend a penny on this game just play free dnt buy any stuff chests will give you same thing over and over again in fact i have noticed people who spend no money get bettter drops then those who do
early access reviewadventure quest 3d is the third adventure quest game so far from what started as a simple but fleshed out inbrowser web game has gone to a sidescrolling mmo and now a fully 3d rpgmmo honestly one the most underrated game series of all time adventure quest 3d only builds upon the already in depth lore not only did they recreate the original town of battleon in 3d but they also expanded upon the simplistic combat style of the original game but added a more engaging feel to fighting overall however i am a bit disappointed that they didnt include the healer class from aqw and the game has a wonderful sense of humor rather than do the runofthemill tutorial it thrusts you right in on the action while also adding in a sarcastic comment about it aq3d is simply not afraid to go against what has already been established in common rpgmmo games and going for a morrowind type of questing giving you a quest and a location and then having you go out and find the quest location and you simply cannot ignore the fact of the seamless intergration of crossplatform play between pc apple and android products i would have to give this game an eight hundred and ten and i can only imagine it will get better as time goes as artix entertainment updates their games frequently
nothing special here not even really worth your time i thought it might be an interesting game to see build up at least since i like the pixel graphics but its not its just a slow boring clicker upgrading buildings doesnt even really change the appearence only adding new buildings to your town does which happens maybe once every one thousand and thirty mins and it just adds one building each building just makes new coins no variety in effect theres an interesting good or evil choice but it doesnt affect what youre actually doing just a slight graphical change and some end game changes actually getting to that end game is still just as boring as the rest only play if you are an avid clicker fan casual fans or those looking for interesting experiences can pass if you like the graphics like me just admire them on the store page and save your time
product received for freeits pretty good but i still get bullied at school i receive daily harrassment for the same thing everyday why do you still play yugioh i come running home everyday crying from the kids taunts as they make fun of my blue eyes white dragon i stare at my seto kaiba poster on the wall waiting for my white knight to take me away from all my pain its midnight that i am still crying for the third time this week when i hear some movement behind my window i wonder who could that be at this hour i open the window to reveal daddy kaiba flying in a tpose shocked i am without words it is he who breaks the silence are you ready to call me king of games yugi i get into position as he pounds my for hours at first my body tries to reject his love but i am soon overcome with pleasure and accept his love after three hours we are finished and he flies out once more crying hahaha you never had a chance you pathetic duelist ecstasy fills me to the brim at these words and i lie in my bed smiling nowadays i dont cry at the kids taunts and instead await for daddy kaibas return1010 would use three blue eyes white dragons in my deck again
i played this emulator of infestationwarz before they had plans of releasing it on steam and take my word on this this emulator is how infestation should be played my buddy and i slay kids on this game and have loads of fun doing it but while this emulator is amazing it isnt perfect some history about this game you should know the creator fredaikis use to be an iss hacker himself who got banned and decided to make his own emulator and anticheat with it the irony in it all is the original developers of iss who banned him initially praised him for his work and made newz officially licensed by their company thats where i kind of cringe when i play this game at times pros skins older skins can be purchased with gd game dollars eventually is far from p2w loads of ars snipers and just looting in general just feels rewarding always and isnt a grind custom characters loads of maps including modifications to the older ones little to no hackers at all maybe came accross one or two during my near one thousands hours of playing this emulator the developers actually listen and care about the community i say this because they shot themselves in the foot when they wiped snipers out of everyones gi little over a year ago and lost a large amount of their fan base including myself and decided to bring them back after asking the community cons still uses the same crappy engine so optimization isnt in anyones favor still havent fixed the aim bug where bullets will randomly shoot elsewhere the spawns are terrible if youre out to jump into high pop pvp campos especially people litterally spawn on top of each other and at that point its a matter of whos going to lose their spawn shield first and lose their sht four man clans an issue that has ruined this games pvp since i began playing trying to do small pvp and having these clans of four five six even eight roll in mowing the place down isnt fun overall amazing emulator highly recommend this version of infestation to anyone thats into pvping
this game is a quite different idle game rather than simply adding up numbers and reincarnate to receive boostsactually this game does similar thing but they way how this game works is more interesting this game offers a vast numbers of spells upgrades and buildings and what player needs to do is to select and explore different combinations the most interesting point is there are nine basic races from three fractions and each of these races have lots and lots of upgrades that may or may not conflict with each other this is the point where some strategic element comes you need to find the most effective build empowers one or several aspect as much as possible to achieve enough resources for abdication reincarnation to me the experience of this game is kind of like playing a rpg game without plotsbut the role play parts are kept this system is sophisicated but it is good enough to outweight its shabby graphics and completely silent gameplay the game has music now fasicinating
early access reviewit is a mobile game put on pc do not play it stay away i played for less than ten min and could not unless you have a touchscreen pc do not even try to play this
to be honest i didnt expect much when i saw the first screenshots oho another cheap arpg i realised very quick that path of exile was closer to diablo ii which is awesome than diablo iii actually is and the skilltree holy this skilltree is mindblasting you gotta focus what you do else you get lost this skilltree the abillitys granted by gems were maybe the reason i met in my first pvp match a lightningbolt spamming warrior which was jumping with his big battle axe over the arena tearing me apart and i was like lol that looked but this is poe
the best game on steam above all else if you do not already own this game or intend on playing it i suggest you literally just shoot yourself here and now this game contains next gen graphics and gameplay with amazing mutliplayer potential the fishing and farming simulation is second to none and becasue of this the game seconds as a solid alternative to either the game farming simulator or fishing simulator i definitley prioritize playing this game to either studying house work or even getting a job due to its amazing features with not a single bug1010 would deeply reconsider what the actual i am doing with my life and also reconsider all of my life choices again
its a great game with a terrible community the gameplay is a lot like super smash bros only you can scale up walls each character has two weapons which drop onto the map as items they can pick up with standard weapon attacks on light attack and signature attacks on heavy attack matches run between four and eight minutes depending on game mode and 1v1 is three stock unless special rules are applied in custom matches this game is a lot of fun to play online against other players or locally with friends there are no pay to win elements in this game so you can start playing and be on equal footing with someone whos been playing for years if you get good at it all legenda and colors can be unlocked in game with gold which you earn after every match you participate in special outfits taunts and accessories for legends are bought with mammoth coins which cost real money but its all cosmetic and all of the legends look are perfectly awesome without them did i mention that the community for this game is also terrible absolutely toxic youll see some of the cheapest most game breaking stuff youve ever seen in this game if you have high blood pressure or anger management problems beware sometimes you will quite the game in sheer frustration because of other players in ffa youll encounter keyboard macros that arent even real players people who deliberately feed other players to rig the match spammers galore evasives who just waste everybodys time and all sorts of other stuff that ruins the game you can win by a wide margin and still feel like the match was just completely ruined and all your time was wasted because of the things other players do in 1v1 youll encounter people who vibrate back and forth like theyre trying to phase through something players that move and act more like self learning ai programs than people not even necessarily good just completely unnatural and players that try to deny you weapons to keep an upper hand then say ez even when they lose if you can forgive a game for its players this game is amazing
i will review this fairly update of march17 they added a update where you can play all the ships for free in solo matches against bots wich is great for proving ships and for people who dont want to play with othersthe game has drops with varius items got a three thousands platinum premium money skin from it this is one of the good games of free to play gameplay meh its pretty much same thing over and over and lack maps and gamemodes only two to choose from learning curve the first ship with usr is crap atleast from my point of view choose zarek or titan in the start til you can buy a better usr ship the game itself is a bit hard to get in to but after five matches you got the hang of it menu its a bit confusing if you read your way thru you will learn it no problemsound i fly your ship you buy me new hat russian navigation officer the game has characters that talk midbattle taunt the people you destroy give hints and are generaly fun to listen to one thousand and ten would hire russian officer again overall deign of flyable ships i think you know what most of my playing hours went in to as a game its pretty meh nothing special and lack of features but as ship design goes see you in a while i will study these more
i regret getting into this i very quickly became well for lack of a better term obsessed i would buy chests whenever they would do the free golden upgrade when you buy a chest over the course of playing this game ive spent quite a pretty penny you can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals which is why they would sucker me in there is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall that is where i draw the line between a good free to play game and a bad one this is a bad one with grabby money tactics and for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added there a special limited time only chests to buy to get equipment just for them it honestly just feels so scammy the prices are a lot for what you are getting you do not get a good value at all dont let their sales fool you dont waste your money on this game they add only benched heroes no actual new ones so in other words you are perpetually swapping out your favorite crusaders for the new cashgrab flavor of the event crusaders that are almost always better there are a few positives such as a nice passive trait tree theyve added but let me warn you this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact same thing over and over and over you will hardly ever switch up your technique until the new flavor of the event because that one group is effective for anything youd do i am a lover of idle games just not this one try tap titans instead it is superior to this game tenfold and they dont lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases note if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money and you dont mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so dont mind the pointless grind because you arent really working towards anything worth getting even though they do have a passive way to spent idols it just doesnt feel rewarding and if you dont mind using the same crusaders because they never add any new heroes they only add heroes to existing benches its hard to explain if you dont play the game youll have to swap out your favorite heroes for the flavor of the event if you dont mind any of that you will like this game i on the other hand am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who when all is said and done gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than aaaindie developers of real games will get and that is just sad from now on i pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap edit i wish that i could find a screenshot i cant help but laugh hysterically the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on a set of three chests costs five they used to be two hundred and ninety nine and get this buy an event jeweled chest bundle today and get a free golden epic card that you wont find anywhere else and there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on holy scam please please dont support these developers stop giving them money i beg you not to do it dont fall into the trap we as people have to tell devleopers that this is the wrong way of making money why are these online prices something you will never see or feel in your hand something that is temporary something that is completely rng you most likely will get crap out of your three chests you buy for five because they want you to buy a bunch of them fortytwo chests for fifty would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent something that is not guaranteed should never be that much money this market isnt for the customers despite its free nature those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth maybe i am alone in this maybe not only time will tell how this market goes
of exile is a better diablo two sequel which blizzard wish they would have developed itdiablo three is a better actionrpg and have a stylized cartoony look path of exile is a better actionrpg and have gritty dark but dated graphics poe a character can be anything and is no one ex a whirlwinding archer but is also raiden from mk with chain lightningsd3 you dont have choices other than cliches and you are the chosen one poe is free and has more players replay value d3 is still expensive with all the dlcs and have a casual or even shallow endgame looking for a well polished hack n slash game d3looking for diablo two on steroids poe
like every game of this kind when it was awesome the first two days it became quickly a pvp even tho they have servers exclusively to play this way every game about gathering resources and fighting zombies is ruined one more time due to the players destroying the fun of the game if you like killing people and going solo this is your game on the other hand if you are a player that likes to cooperate with other players explore other places than your respawn place that it will be your home now gather resources etc this is not your game basically you will just find snipers all around the cities and close to the safeplaces shooting everything that moves except zombies it is a free game so give it a try but i would not pay a single penny for this
"i say other games like dota allstars dota2 and heroes of the storm that ive played are all great games and deserve nine hundred and ten and other dotalike games that i didnt mention are just shadowed by dota2 but they arent as actionpacked arent as visually polished as smite their ranged attack cant be dodged or blocked their combat field lane jungle are smaller more crowded with incommensurately large model of characters and spells their heroes have eyes in the back of their heads for example i think dota2s artwork is great the other day i roomed in and found out a man are almost as high as a tree and the landscape is just non existent im so disappointed that i suddenly found out im just not playing an aaa game for the actionpacked juking and vision part go google smite top five plays casted by inuki and one will feel the thrill that other mouseclicking dota wont give just remember when one dashes forward in smite heshe will see everything moving backward and will have effective vision field shrinking compared to the more boring three hundred and sixty degree vision field of most other dota games one only have part of seven hundred and twenty degrees in smite i said other popular dotalike games are great but the comparison is cruel so either six hundred and ten to them and nine hundred and ten to smite or if one cant accept theyre six then nine hundred and ten to them and one thousand, five hundred and ten to smite deal with it"
early access reviewas a retired aqw player just no its just bad just like others say ui sucks and i just dont like the layout and how they cater to a mobile audience it looks bad and it plays bad and apparently its a money grabber sorry artix entertainment but this is
early access reviewmy review of this product ill make this as simple as possible stay away you do not want to buy this i dont care what your friends tell you dont buy it and get them to refund the english translation of this game is horrible the fact cheaters are allowed to roam around without any kind of meaningful punishment makes playing the game honestly not worth it if you expect good performance think again oh hey content was removed from the game at launch of early access and is being slowly trickled back in does that make you want it more the cm is a joke i think i will end my rant here never have faith in a game or a company until you do your research best advice i can give you tldr no just no look away train wreck in progress
early access reviewif you like world of tankswarships but fancy flying about in space this is for you i quickly tried a couple of games last night2 and a half hours later i stopped playing it is good fun quite addictive and free to play what more could you ask for would i recommend this game yes yes i would
hands down this game has the best fighting system of all mmos one of the problems that i have with other fighter mmos is that the combat are too slow in this game however its fast just like how a fighting game should be fast and intense the dungeon can get boring after a while but the pvp is where this game shines it is where you put what you have learn to use against other people but i dont recommend you start pvping till youre level three hundred and fifty two thousand and fifteen update there are now some balancing issues some charactersclasses are just outright overpowered the other classescrimson avengerdiabolic esper thankfully there is a patch coming that will be nerfing them
early access reviewadventurequest 3d is a pretty cool mmo and i would like to see where it goes given time hopefully the population sticks around long enough for the game to settle into its place on steam i am a fan of the visuals the soft smooth colors look really nice in my opinion i would strongly recommend any fans off the other adventure quest games to try adventure quest 3d out
so far not too impressed bought the game and cant connect to server at all aparently some north american client has this bug i did everything sugested on their known bugs page and no joy i paid for it and cant use it now i cant give it a good recommendation cant i too bad looked neat on the screenshots update although the support section was kind enough to spend a couple of hours with me the game still wont connect to the server at the end they blamed my internet set up an ordinary router hooked up to a pc box but could not tell me why so i had to uninstall a game ive never played waste of time and money update after more than a year i changed my pc and now it work its a nice open cube building world but im reaaallly not crazy about having to be connected all the time to the server even though i single play and having only a limited territory to build stuff
honestly as one of the best gamers in the world i gotta admit you would hardly ever see me playing a game like this ever truth but once you check it out for yourself youll see that all the bad reviews are nothing but trolls just today i spent five hours in there i was like holy lol also the way you can build things are so much better then minecraft by a thousand i take a step back an see what i created an say damn i made that an now i want people to come check it out honestly its that fun if you like to build things out of the blue an spend lots of hours having fun with your kids or friends this game will take you there not only that all the animals look like they came from a bob marley festival lol seriously but that makes it even cooler i made my home on top of it all i just started building on top of a tree an then three hours later i had a kingdom lol but im still working on though so anyway i gave my two cents download the game a see its the way mine craft should have been seriously download give it a try an show you know how to create things out of thin air join us or forever no what its like lol truth
instant delete after not even ten minuets of gameplay there are no crosshairs and you cant look down the scope of your gun unless youre using a sniper the ui is terrible i thought people were over exaggerating when they said this games ui appears as if it was made by a nine year old
early access reviewat this current moment this game isnt worth a dime i would strongly suggest you wait till it either goes on sale or eventually goes free to play in a few months optimization isnt a thing server lag and frame rates are horrible and the english translations are bad i spent most of my six hours of gameplay in queue to play the game only to get access to a screen that told me the area was too crowded this game has potential to be great just not anytime in the near future
terrible terrible game unfinished cash grab to complete their release on xbox get out while you can honestlyit is laggy in cities when only five people are present for context i have a gtx nine hundred and seventy and i7 4770k so that is all i can vouch for but friends i played with who had better graphics cards said it lagged for them as well but again that is only ancedotal the content is super lacking with the devs having no idea how to balance the skills i am looking at you when they patched pvp but it then took twenty min to kill one mob also after that they add in npcs into arenas which can just one shot you and totally ruins any aspect of pvp the game is terribly optomized it lacked features that were already out in other regions the suposedly new combat system was pretty much the same as in japan with only minor tweaks that actually hurt the combat the devs seem to have no idea how their game actually works since the balance patches tend to break more things than they fix the game being free to play changes my review slightly in saying that sure go ahead and try even with it being free to play i would not wast my time and thus it still remains a thumbs down for me
early access reviewawesome way better than pubg less lag and you actually have a chance of winning in this game the concept is awesome a group of people are stranded at a ski resort and must kill each other to increases the chance of survival while also escaping a snowice stormzone when the zone reahces its limit a rescue helicoptor lands and four people are able to board you must board to win the match i highly recomend this game
i have been playing this game since 2012i have on two accounts sunk around seventeen hundreds hours this used to be an amazing game and at times it stil can be but so far it is mired in so so many issues that valve simply refuses to fix solutions that are relativley simple to introduce but never are and the end result is an absolutely horrendous gaming experience they added a leveling system for no purpose other than cosmetic the servers are either barely populated or populated by new players being destroyed by more experienced players because matchmaking just haphazardly shoves in people of all skill levels theres no system in place to pit people of an equal or similar skill level in the same server to make for a balanced fun and fair experience which youd think theydve thought to implement but nah the level system is just there for show it makes for an extremely unsatisfying gaming experience i cannot count how many times ive been on a team made up of new players most of them snipers and spies fighting against a team that just curbstoms them before they even know whats going on this is not good its frustrating and its killing the gaming experience for everyone new players dont get better and simply get frustrated that theyre being shitwhipped and stomped left and right by stronger players veteran players stuck on underpowered teams get frustrated at the lack of quality control on servers and some veteran players find the idea of just wrecking house in a minute and leaving to be a very underwhelming and boring gaming experience and no it being casual does not excuse this the majority of people play tf2 on casual and we deserve more quality control to make sure our gaming experiences are worth having the servers are constantly full of snipers and spies because the game has no universial class limit the game is also extremely unwelcoming to new players the training system failsto cover most of the nuances of the game it has an absurdly high learning curve unless you know it like the back of your hand before going in as i did youre going to have a hard time and the hackers in the past two weeks ive encountered about five hackers four times i was kicked off of the server for reporting the hacker and trying to get my team to kick them i dont know how but there seriously need to be better ways to combat hackers on the servers because this is unacceptable this game is at this point a rotting shambling corpse fun at times yeah but severely frustrating in a way it has no right to be given how easy the solutions to its myriad of issues would be my gaming experiences recently have been nothing short of frustrating its making me frustrated and i start acting like an â â â â â â â and at that point i think its just not worth it and at the same time i want to enjoy this game because i love it ive loved this game even before i played it i was in love with its comedy its world i read the wiki devouring everything i could until the day i could play it ive been playing it since two thousand and twelve i dont want to give up on it but i have for a period and only recently decided to come back to it but honestly i cant reccomend it at this point
"early access reviewa pretty fun game in this review im gonna list the pros and cons of this game pros can be fun with friends and with online matches sometimesa wide variety of legends to choose from its not pay to winranked is just as fun as casual play but with everything there are some cons cons no matter how you lose or how close you are to winning somebody will always say gg ezsome legends have to edge over most of being salty just because they lost dash itselfbut this game is pretty fun and is fairly easy to pick up and play anytime eight thousand, five hundred and ten"
this game has some amazing graphics but in some places it derps out but that doesnt matter you will only get the charaters if you watched the movies tho the game has gotton all the quest people right and the dragons are correct aswell its amazing what these people can do and what motivates them
from a game developer and artist standpoint the backlash against the change is ridiculous the biggest issue that elder scrolls from an art direction standpoint has always fell short is their lack of color ever since i can remember they have been focused solely on brown which is the color of poop my friends and while it gave the series a distinct look it is rather boring lets be honest what the art directors have done here is theyve introduced more color and interest to the existing brown the brown isnt gone people embrace the brown cause its still there but now there is a focus on bringing in lavender and blues and deep dark purples i love it the game has a vibrancy it lacked before and i would love for the eso universe to start integrating more color into its art dont get stuck in the past with nostalgia there is always room for improvement and changing how your players experience the world dont listen to this loud vocal minority that is trying to sway you back to their nostalgic roots keep the new look its beautiful
early access reviewplay this game if you have played other artix entertainment games or want an mmo on mobile devices you might want to play this game with people cross platform as it is on both ios and android i really like aq3d but i have played aqw and other artix entertainment games since two thousand and nine so i might be a little biased it is very simple and there is not a lot of content but it is fun on the go or when listening to a podcast or music
early access reviewi never thought i would be scared of this gamea little boy hiding being a screen watching markipler play this i never thought it would be scary when the first jumpscare happened it didnt scare me but when i went on it started too when i got to that dead space looking part and i turned on the power againi paniced and died also spooky got to stop her crap here have infinite stamina me awww thanks tries to run really but im stuck at room seven hundred before you make the restcant wait d

played this for a little while got tired of the ridiculous microtransaction paywall the dragon timers and the bugs and glitches its been so long since i played this that i couldnt even remember the name let alone why i quit playing all i knew is that i will never play this again if i have any choice in the matter ten wont make that mistake again
those puppets man they freak me out cant get away from the evil puppets then again i might just suck great freebie though dont let the childish appearance and graphics fool you this is indeed a horror game and not a bad one at that if i say so myself play it

early access reviewi just place one with trading kills at end prior to that in the same match there was literally four trades you cant have a a king of the hill mode and have trades
although the community can be quite toxic and there are a few balance issues i recommened this if you have friends to play with getting into a voice chat and playing with a good friend is the most fun ive had this summer
clearly designed to be a mobile game infested with microtransactions and extremely cluttered ui limited settings dont do any good for this even though its free to play i didnt even get into it
in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes benjamin franklinwhen dlc was first introduced to the world people were afraid of it becoming too out of control which it has and while its hard for most freetoplay games to survive in the market these days a game based entirely off of dlc is something that you can be sure will die off quickly enter thehunter where the base game is free and features a mileslong island for you to explore a shooting range and nothing else the games economy is based in the real world and funded by buying dlc packs here you need hunting licenses just to hunt animals or defend yourself from an attacking one and for that you need to spend real world money an exorbitant amount i dare say that means paying real money to hunt virtual animals while the guns themselves do come at a cost that could be understood from a dlc perspective it would make better sense to charge fifteen outright and have the first dlc be the game the devs have assumed that youre interested and will pay for the privilege to shoot something allow me to make a suggestion to you the reader play the cabellas dangerous hunts series instead they offer a better and more exciting experience and if you buy the game used a cheaper one how thehunter has managed to remain online this long without offering anything for free is a total mystery the graphics are on par with the last generation of games and hold up really well if you have a computer thats a few years old the island atmosphere and landscape are well done and the animal models look good theres no guessing as to what youre trying to shoot this is about the only saving grace that this little bit of game has to offer i know im being unfair but since this game is labeled as freetoplay and only features the engine itself the dlc being something outside of the initial package means that all youre allowed to do is shoot a couple of guns at the shooting range which makes this whole thing merely a tech demo its in bad taste to say something is free but offer nothing if i wanted to go hunting i know people who will take me along on a trip and it will be a more fulfilling experience cheaper too death and taxes are the only certain things in life so i can safely say that ill die before im taxed by a video game
i let my kid play this game because of how safe it is from online predators and rapists they wont even let people say the words cute or wood thats how you know its a safe game a
i will make this short and sweet the game like all games has glitches we all know that i lost some important ingame things that i was upset about but the support team helped me out in a very good way so great job to them if you enjoy day z youll like this much better there is more detail and much more to come dont let one bad experience ingame ruin your whole experience push it aside and survive like you always will
i love clicker games with an actual goal other than non stop clicking the tropies in game helps move that along and makes it feel like its nonrepetitive definitely one of my favorites
have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day leveling it up so your friends think you are cool then this is the best game for you first job get a strange either by wasting your money on uncrating crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on tf2outpost or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to uncrate and give himher a scrap for hisher recently unboxed strange step two locate a strange level up sever dont worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their stranges so badly and final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever now all your friendseniemes will think next time you kill them wow they got sixteen million eight hundred and fiftyfour thousand nine hundred and seventytwo kills in one day defiently didnt go on a strange level up sever one thousand and ten best game
this used to be a good game but once they got rid of the tiers robits and be the boss or go up against one mode it instantly became crap especially after the introduction of lootboxes and rng
early access reviewi decided to come back to this game after a few months of not playing and after a full night of playing with a soviet soldier the last time i played i was an american soldier i noticed that i had unlocked essentially nothing i went from the initial rank to barely rank two in three hours of play and had unlocked no upgrades remembering that the leveling and unlocks went faster when i first played i checked my american soldier despite having played him for only two hours had many fewer kills and objective captures with him he was rank four with many more ribbons unlocked have i mentioned that you need a great deal more experience with every subsequent rank the game is basically worthless to play without paying at this point i am entirely for supporting free to play games with microtransactions to get things faster but not if they make it entirely worthless to play without paying the game is fun the bullet mechanics are fun the realism aspects are fun the idea is unique but they have butchered the game by crippling any xp gains
early access reviewa suprisingly fun and decent card game even if its visual design feels like its aping hearthstone a bit too closely after actually giving it some time ive found it to be a good game in its own right i especially enjoy the twotier mana system where you require both a you must be this tall influence cost and a flat mana cost definitly worth checking out if you like these types of games try not to be put off by the tuturial overstaying its welcome a bit as well as getting trounced in it the starter decks are actually really bad but as soon as you throw together even a haphazard one of your own its much better
early access reviewnot a bad game love the graphics and the general idea but no i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone just yet the aiming is beyond stupid the movement and actions need tonnes of work but yea the aiming is unplayable
early access reviewpretty good game so far i love that you get to spawn immediatly where you want i love the three classes that you can use in a variety of ways to out play other players so far the only down fall is just the norm for an early access game car wheels are transparent until you get up close the driving however is awkward and seems slow to react those are the only issues i have run across so far i really like how fast you get into games and how well the loot is spread out cant wait to see how this turns out
early access reviewthe game is beautiful but the game is not beginner friendly theres no tutorial right after you start the game so if you dont notice the tutorial video at the hub and clicked the tutorial button youll be lost to the void of fractured space i played a game without knowing anything and i dont know what to do except to shoot my guns and button mash my skills and capture points but i dont know how the whole game works mechanically like how the upgrades works and so on
really cool game please forget the game part and a lot of fun but like others have said the cost to get more guns is simply not worth it to me i do understand all the modeling that went into this and it is pretty extensive but the costvalue just is not there for me i do not love the controls but they are workable maybe it is for you
"i have two thousand, one hundred and seven hours on this game its a fun game i recommend it unless you get mad and salty quick then dont play it i like how the developers update the game every week with new content overall this game is a must"
fun free game similar to the older sims games have a bunch of dwellers with stats that can level up build bunker rooms and forage in the wasteland for gear and partsd fight off raider attacks mutant cockroaches giant rats and try to breed superhuman dwellers while it does have some in game purchases noone of them are required to advance normally in the game they are conveniences like a robot that gathers the resources from your rooms which is one lunchboxes which you can get from quests anyway etc its definately not pay to win sadly there is no multiplayer aspect i would like to be able to send raiding parties against other players and to fight those raiding parties off
this game is like all simulators at oncefishing simulatorfarming simulatorloading screen simulatorfps simulatorpet abusing simulator1010 would shoot worms out of the sky again
all the things the other negative reviews say about this game are true from crashes and bugs that havent been fixed in years to the absolutely terrible balance of weapons vehicles maps new sounds and addition of dx12 support are proof that you can not polish a turd watch the dev streams and see them sitting there drinking beer shows you how seriously they take this game dont waste your time grinding things as they will just nerf them infact dont waste your time at all and play something else
early access reviewits not good if youre over the age of twelve but if youre a child youll probably get addicted to this and spend all of mommies money on it pros people making it have been making this series for years so itll definitely have a certain loveqaulitycons its for children and the storywriting certainly reflects that constantly spouting memes at you its not funfunny
product received for freethis game is sort of good but the pay to progress system is flawed badly and developers are just money hungry while the game itself continues to be broken and the developers dont bother fixing the core experience of the game and only add minimal changes every update the game has been getting worse and worse with updates hurting the core gameplay instead of fixing it on top of that theres the awful matchmaking this game is a joke
i am a very old payer of this game ever since wildshadow owned it and there was the old forums this game used to be amazing fun interactive and enjoyable you had to put time into the game to get anywhere and even then you could lose it all in one death regardless of that it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put five hours a week personally i was very addicted to this game during twenty elevens and two thousand and twelve then doomsday came kabam bought realm of the mad god everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things back in the old days you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier twelve item in the wine cellar now just buy realm gold and get tier twelve items in nexus its ed up unless youre rich as and dont care about money dont get this game
in a world where every mobastyled game is getting more and more toxic smite is one of the last of its kind that i can enjoy dont get me wrong youll still run into the occasional game with someone who just has to ruin your day but overall ive found the community here to be much more welcoming and helpful the game modes are diverse and the massive character roster ninety one atm i think keeps you from getting too bored i feel i should note that the god pack for this game is one hundred worth it as youll get every character released as they come out which is a huge value at the very least give the game a try
early access reviewthe defs are fing it up they are ruining everything and now they want to delete the mega bots too i quit playing sure if u play this for the first time or you play it since the rocket launcher it looks fun but for the people that play it since it went online its going the wrong way
this game is cool how to be pro1 get one hundred and buy tons of keys2 wait for em to become tradable3 buy unusualsaustralium if you dont have enough keys add more funds4 get burning unusuals scorching5 go to farming server and rank up your australium to hales own6 go to random server and people will praise yousuch good gamei rate it nine hundred and eleven ʖ
i only played this game for twentythree minutes which was more than enough time to know that this game is not for me i wont recommend this game but nor will i trash it what i will say however is if you are interested in becoming a pilot one day then this game is probably a good place to start but if youre just looking for the ability to jump in a plane and take off with minumal commands and no realworld preflight experience fly around and shoot stuff then this game is not for you eitherjust a bit too much realism for me
early access reviewno its trash play alliance of valiant arms its free if your computer cant run it then play crossfire its free too anything but this but stay away from combat arms
i usually dont play online card games because in my opinion card games like this seem to typically be based more on luck instead of skill which i dont like i also typically dont play online card games because a decent amount seem to be pay to win cough cough hearthstone cough cough and sadly this game seems to already be going down a pay to win path its not as pay to win however seeing as how getting money for card packs seems to be a lot easier than it is in hearthstone but i am still somewhat dissapointed that despite the fact that this game is only about a month old there are technically two dlcs the dark brotherhood cards and the heroes of skyrim dlc the game gave me the alduin heroes of skyrim deck for free i dont know why and i played with it a bit and the heroes of skyrim cards absolutely destroy core cards which kinda upset me i just hope it doesnt get to the point where everyone just uses skyrim cards just to avoid being crushed by other people with skyrim cards because most of the core cards are very good but only against other core cards the only thing i can say i fully enjoyed from this game was the story the story is difficult but not too difficult which i loved and the rewards you get for playing it are amazing overall i have to say i dislike this game but if you are a person who thinks they could get into it i highy reccomend playing the campaign fully for all the nice bonuses and also dont spend your gold on core cards but skyrim card packs with it so you dont get crushed
i have about over two thousands hours on this gamealso add four hundred hours from steam this game is heavily p2w but it is possible to acquire endgame stats with event items and such i dont recommend this game only for the sole reason that new content runs out so quickly and there are gender locked classes
early access reviewadventure quest 3d is quite good it is not wow it is not aqw and it doesnt attempt to be either of them what it does do is provide a really fun causual and social mmo that is truly cross platform and has a logical gear progression crafting system directly tied to raiding end game raiding in aq3d is as casual as you would want it to be on an mmo that is largely played on phones and tablets you click an npc and are instantly grouped and teleporterd to the ongoing raids most rewards after getting an acceptable lvl twentytwo gear set are cosmetic in nature and aq3d allows for much deeper cosmetic customisation options that appear at first glance max level is currently twenty two
the moment i played this game i knew i will be having stiff necks and backaches it is so addictive that you totally forget the time and the tasks you are suppose to do in real life for those of you who loves to base build and play same concept of this game from facebook i am warning you to stay away youll be so hooked that you even forget to eat and sleep
its pay to win but you can play without it after while i started to visit the inc wawes are not fair enemy get just balons and i four red air ships and im not talking about enemy bought them for relax okay but for ranks play not
early access reviewi cant even get a refund with eight hours at this complete mess spend eighty for me and my girl to just afk move around a laggy worldnot reccomended its scumdevs said you can refund it steam doesnt accept refunds stay away this is cashgrab and a fat one
very well put together game the passive tree is extremely diverse and theremore allows for many different types of gameplay also has a very good free to play model there is no pay to win only aesthetics and bank space can be bought
i loved to play rotmg on my browser for maybe a year but when i saw it on steam while just looking around i had to get it but i have found some flaws compared to the browser version one lags more on steam and two when i go into a realm the coins fame thing is just all messed up by it all merged together on the top right of the mini map but i still really enjoy this game
early access reviewi think this game is currently the closest thing to a magic the gathering adaption on the digital market it combines the simplicity of hearthstone with the depth of magic it contains a lot of playmodes several designed pve encounters two procedural pve modes one mimicing draft casual and ranked pvp and a very well designed draft pvp mode additionally the reward system is very generous and allows starters to quickly get into the game all in all this game scratches my mtg itch when needed and is not as expensive or shallow as hs
early access reviewi played this game as i did not want to pay to play a game like pubg i really liked things about this game but there are more things that make this game unplayable the movement system it is so bad and slow that octodad gives you better controls then this game the spawning in the game is actually so bad that i spawned in a house by itself that was already looted then i play another game where i loot a whole city and not even an axe spawned if you want to update the game you need to launch it first so most of the time for me i forget to see for the updates and update the game so when i want to play the game there is most likely an update so i dont bother and play another game instead some games i litterally cant find anyone and then other games i get eleven kills as i am somehow in the middle of everythingsome guns are soo bad that you may as well just run away and hope that they dont have good aim guns like the kar can become obsolite with the other person wearing level three body armor i once put four mags of five shots into a guy only missing once or twice and after about eighteen shots he diedgraphics are mediocre but not bad so i cant dislike it i love the style goofy and realistic and mixes the two almost perfectly such as bunny shoes that allow you to jump extremely high or a cigar that gives a damage boostsadly there is not much to like about the game at the moment i want this game to surpas pubg but at the moment but many thigs conflict at the moment i hope some of these problems get fixed
early access reviewhate the slow pace of pubg and the building in fortnite this game is actually fun having an mmooverwatch vibe to it with different classes and abilities makes it feel so fresh to the genre this is definitely my new game and im so happy i dont have to play fortnite anymore
world of guns gun disassembly it is rather good but the tutorial is like a school lesson boring and to interact with the weapon without limits you have to disassemble reassemble and do the challenge to reassemble as fast as possible pros clear explanation of wrapon work cool slomo effect xrays overview of weaponscons gun tutorial is like a school lesson disassembly reassembly and challenge must be first done to use weapon without limits i want the challenge optional conclusion is it looks good but i am seeking something that doesnt make me feel like in school
this is my review of this game for starters the game is about ww2 where you pick factions in early game the soviets the germans and the alliesus each factions has pros and cons for what i observed its a free to play game made by retomoto the game itself is fun wide maps you have opportunity to become a pilot tanker recon or a general itself please dont be like those bad generals if you become one like the map has no carsbikes etc as a new player of the game you will have an infantry as a starter character of the game if you play us you will have m1 garand which has good sights in my opinion if you play germany you will have g43 or gewehr fortythree which has good precision when not aiming if you play soviets you will have svt40 it is a flexible gun now here comes the new player life as a new player you will be on bronze tier and will be on encounter match this is the best part when you try to understand the game mechanics use this opportunity to understand the game just my advice youll be versed with bronze skills till silver skills then gold once youve hit the gold tier welcome to the worst part of the game q why is it worst when youre onto gold skill tier a as a new player you will be just running using bicycles using civilian truck and you will be getting camped by recons or infantries with bolt action rifles one hit this part will irritate you the most a the second worst is that tanks with he shells spawn camp you be grateful if one of your teammates are antitank psychos a the third worst part the planes will destroy you if they see you running in the open my advice if they have fighter planesheavy fighter planes and you dont have a car go run in the forest area or a place where keeps you hidden with shadowsa the fourth worst part is that once you are onto capping zone enemies who have heavy set badges will be hard to kill because heavy set badges reduces damage and you are just using your tiny cute stock tier one gun and you will be the one who get killed first because they have better guns than you a the fifth worst part for you you will be versed with insanely good players in some games the matchmaking has skill callibration where you get to your own skill tier and this game has dont q why i dont recommend this game a the game is way too grindy this makes you pay a real dollar into a pixel money sounds stupid but thats the reality of this game i prefer to grind in an different mmorpg game than to grind in this gamea reto or the game company does not listen to the communities opinion they just making new bs planes new guns they should improvise the maps with weather and the infantry character for me once you get your one hit guns mgs badges cars planes tanks best assault rifles then the game starts to be fun let me tell you if you want to enjoy being tilted triggered or become a masochist then this game is for you my game rating four hundred and ten
so unbalanced if youve previously played the full pc version worldoftanks euas a unicum pro stat padder on the other game i can say that this version is like killing puppies if you have any skill
early access reviewvery good game i lloved swtors new space combat system but i was found it stupid just fot that subscribe every mounth i was looking for a game to replace and finally i found it the game is new and in early acces and for this the game is imba but its need worked on it i hope it will not stay like this ps my english sucks i now
early access reviewthis game is probably worse than cod in its current condition why well condider this pretend you want a paratrooper you have to be level seven to be a paratrooper the average player gets about two hundred exp per skirmish match it takes sixty six thousand exp in total to get to level 7do you see where this is going this game is a grind it has microtransactions everywhere it is unbalanced its tutorial is crap dont play this game just dont
early access reviewvery well made fun as well cheaters are treated with serious punishments there are rumors and lies going on about this game having mlaware ive scanned it eight times with avast and havent caught anything or had any trouble
early access reviewthe movement is buggy crouching is buggy the mouse movement is laggy and feels nonresponsive the servers suck the ui is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time most of it is just lag from my experience the guns are ridiculously op the spawns are broken there are angles that provide immense advantage others players cant shoot you there is no need for iron sights however i had loads of fun playing this game headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying the game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p i like the point system to buy guns but i think you should be able to gain points over time also more options should be implemented fov slider for example the game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as i am concerned overall i thought the game was fun and i could oversee the flaws i recommend it if you want to pass some free time in the future i might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun
early access reviewawesome game with every update it gets better and better the community is tightknit and there isnt very much negativity everyone works together its being constantly updated with great updates the look of the armors and weapons gets better and better and its definitely not pay2win they only charge for cosmetic stuff because they have to have a profit or they cant keep developing its not required to buy them at all ive been besided artix entertainment since i was a kid and played the original adventurequest from near the beginning they always deliver the best content they can and this game is a new direction for them and its definitely the right direction
early access reviewthe best streamlined card game ive played beating hearthstone hex and magic duels the game is also extremely generous for a f2p entry and gives you tons of ways to earn coins and packs there are so many ways to play1 campaigns free to enter a short set of campaigns against ai opponents that guide you through game mechanics they are a little boring and could use some rework as theyve been around for a long time you get rewarded with a basic card pool2 puzzles free to enter eighty puzzles centered around game mechanics that teach you corner cases and nuances a blast to play and you get rewarded with a good bit of gold3 gauntlet free to enter most useful gold farming mode you face off seven ai opponents and are challenged to beat them all without losing doing so nets you a rank up containing packs and gold until you heart max rank master after master you can still grind gauntlet for the rewards of two silver chests containing gold4 forge free to enter mix between draft and sealed like hearthstones arena you pick one of three given cards until you end up with a twentyfive card deck you face ai opponents until you either win seven or lose two if you win seven you rank up just like gauntlet5 draft 5k gold to enter draft a card from a booster pack and pass the rest to your neighbor until you have drafted forty card make a deck and then play other players seven wins or three losses three wins and you are ahead seven wins and you get a ton of stuff your win record is tracked and you are ranked from bronze to master6 casual free to enter constructed play against another player but your win recordrank isnt recorded minimal rewards from winning but great to try out decks or get used to constructed7 ranked free to enter constructed play against another player and your win record is recorded winning can rank you up from bronze to master gauntlet has better goldminute but trying to hit diamondmaster in ranked is a challenge of its own eight events variable cost to enter the devs run events usually twelve a month with special deck construction rules i e mono color decks only or play rules draw two cards a turn variables prizes but almost always worth doing if you are starting out play gauntlet until you get to gold or diamond and are having a hard time winning then play forge to master then return to gauntlet then draft until you run out of gold then play gauntlet and ranked and save gold to draft more somewhere in there do some fun puzzles at the end of each month you get rewarded packs for your ranked and draft ranks ive only played for a couple of months and i have three fully built tier twelve constructed decks and am working on four my friend started less than a month ago and already has 40k gold nine drafts not including winnings
early access reviewfun game when playing with friendsinteresting robot creationlots of guns but i didnt like this zendesk support why august twelve 2016my account was suspended because of my name i sent a ticket asking for explanations i dont believe my name is offensive somehow three days later a freejam representative i wont say his name in public replied removing my suspension warning he said as i dont believe your username is all that offensive his words i playing for a while then stopped until february twenty seventeens when i start playing again only to get suspended again no reason stated this time on twentythird of feb i sent a ticket a week passes i sent another one six july twenty seventeens today and still havent received a reply steamsalty
fun game but if youre looking for nwn style gameplay you wont find it here if you go in to this expecting nwn you wont like it if you go in to it knowing that it is more hacknslash you might enjoy it it has elements from dd which is cool just dont expect the combat to feel anything like dds dice based combat if you want dice rolls go play if its still alive ddo dungeons and dragons online its based in eberron which im not a fan of but its better than nothing
early access reviewthis game is soo amazing and it looks fantastic for early alfa gameplayanyway if you like things like war thunder or wolrd of tanks and you like space then get this game right now
i didnt expect much from mobile version of really enjoyable game but to be honest i never thought it will be this bad and i dont mean graphics and stuff here 7vs7 battles doesnt feel really exciting maps are way too small to enjoy even ten of original pc version of world of tanks almost every battle doesnt even last twenty three minutes and its not only low tier thing also having no arty isnt a good thing but i know it would be too hard to pull on mobile game there is no trace of tactics left i really wanted to play it for much longer but sadly i wont i dont really understand the reason why mobile port makes it on steam not the normal version too scared of war thunder having some kind of competition is always great but world of tanks blitz will probably make only people stay away from wargaming games
giving these gys a second chance unfortuinately they have not learned from their mistakes still from the past game they made sadly enough nothing has changed at all in this new infestation there is nothing new about it at all same maps same overlay same carelessness sadly enough i kinda knew this would be the cash the only pro i can give is they didnt rip people off this time making people pay for the game they still cant own up to promises they have made would not recommend it to anyone non the less waste money on the game as well
early access reviewvery stupid but still entertaining game jerky controls but you will still manage to get kills its oddly accurate with sights the game is just weird it runs good but the engine is just strange
addictive and great to have on in the background isnt a strain on on the computer neither also the feeling of progressing when being afk or away at workschool takes out the grinding dread if i had the money i would put into micro transaction i feel free to play this game is really well done only critism i have is a cleaner ui maybe have another tab for all the sales and other stuff instead of it in the side
leaves suspecious program that that runs on startup after you uninstall it other than that the game is fun at the beginning but quickly gets repetitive since most vehicles are the same and theres a really long grind to unlock new things
early access reviewi was hoping for something a little different but this is just another generic onrails mmorpg the biggest appeal to me is that it doesnt take itself very seriously but in terms of gameplay its all been done a thousand times before
early access reviewpure garbage players that are impossible to kill instarespawn in the same spot to get revenge if you kill them total garbage uninstalling this piece of good thing i didnt have to pay for it no na servers all ru eu
edit for a disclaimer this game was available for several months before steam release so my playtime here on steam does not nearly reflect the hundreds of hours i have played this game since closed beta are you looking for the best card game out there look no further i have played three different card games and this is the one i stuck to i have been playing it since closed beta back in summer last year and i still enjoy the game which says a lot this is quite an extensive review it is structured as follows first a comparison to other card games hs and gwent then a general pro and contra list and lastly my rating tldr it is a great game you should give it a try if you like card games or any elder scrolls game what sets this game apart from other card games lets compare it to the most famous one first hearthstone tesl has a lot less rng so skill and strategic thinking gets rewarded more tesl is way more generous in terms of acquiring cards the story mode is very rewarding and you get rare epic and legendary cards while leveling up your character to level fifty also arena rewards are better and runs stop at seven wins seven wins can give you up to four card packs you can definitely play this game without spending money on it you just have to invest some time of course game mechanics there is the rune system which draws you a card for every five health you lose if it is a prophecy card you can play it for free during your opponents turn this keeps aggro decks in check and adds interaction aside from that there are two boards lanes in this game which add a lot more complexity to the gameplay since you cant shut down your opponent by playing one big guard no hero powers while many classes in hs are defined by their hero powers tesl is a lot more flexible in that regard there are ten classes each a combination from two of the five colorsattributes but you can play monocolor as well if you want to and each class has multiple viable archetypes just as an example control mage is a very classic control deck in the colors blue and yellow but you can also create a very aggressive action deck in those colors and a less aggressive midrange version archer red green has aggro midrange combo and control decks there is a lot of variety the developers are very reactive in terms of cardbalance if a card becomes too opressive and a single deck dominates the entire meta they usually react to it very fast when doing so they have shown to have a good hand for it unlike in hs many of the nerfed cards remain viable after their nerf cards usually dont get nerfed to death laddering is much more pleasing you cant lose ranks in tesl which makes the whole experience a lot less frustrating also you have to win less matches to make it to legend rank since there are only twelve ranks and lastly the monthly rankreset is very friendly you get reset to rank five if you finished at least rank four or higher or nine if you finished at least rank eight or higher recently gwent was released which i played for a few weeks during closed beta so let me adress this as well gwent is a very original game because of its 2roundwinsystem and the abundance of a manasystem which truly sets it apart from other card games this might be refreshing for some players but for me personally it is too far away from traditional card games it feels more like a board game to me because i want interactions between minions in a card game so while tesl is a much more complex and better game in the style of hearthstone gwent is pretty much its own game in addition to that tesl has one very huge advantage over gwent there are already mobile versions for the game smartphone versions are not released yet but they are expected to be released early summer so that shouldnt take much longer currently the android tablet app also works on phones its just not optimized for it and menus and stuff are a little tiny on a smartphone screensome general thoughts on whats good and bad aside from the alreday mentioned things good the meta this has to do with the point about the devs being reactive but even without them intervening the meta is usually very diverse in tesl first of all you can win with every archetype but aside from that the meta never really gets dominated by one single deck because there are counters to every deck as a result the meta can be very shifty if too many people play a certain deck more people will start to run decks that counter that deck if that counterdeck gets too popular there is usually another deck that counters it i personally never experienced such a lively meta in a cardgame before solo content tesl offers a solo arena mode in which you can draft a deck and play against the ai and you still get some nice rewards for it so you dont even have to face human opponents if you dont feel like it additionally the story mode in tesl is the best one i have ever seen in a cardgame the campaign is a nice start but the recently added expansion dark brotherhood really took it to the next level unlike those boring hs adventures that you just had to complete to get new cards there is actually an interesting story to play through and the levels along the way are also created in a very creative way tes lore do you like tes games you will probably recognize a few characters in here i think the majority of cards were inspired by the elder scrolls online but it is definitely not limited to that oh and the menu soundtrack is as good as you would expect it from a tes game monthly cards to keep the game fresh the devs add a new monthly card every season some of them are very impactful and shake up the meta others are not anyway it is very nice to see new content that regularly gauntlet mode this new game mode was already announced and should be released very soon the general idea is that there will be certain rules for deck construction you can then enter gauntlet mode with your deck built according to those rules and face other players your run ends after three losses so it is somewhat comparable to arena entrence fee should be the same as well bad now this is purely a matter of taste but some people dislike the look of the game i personally like it and it think it fits the general theme of tes games very well also it looks much more mature and serious than hs for example still they could add some new gameboards and more songs to the soundtrack since you can get tired of those after almost a year of playing this game rewards for ranked mode you receive one two or three copies of the monthly card depending on your rank each season rank nine five or one which is cool but other than that the rewards are a little lackluster just a bit of gold and some dust for crafting cards marketing bethesda has not yet pushed this game a lot so the playerbase is still fairly limited dont get me wrong there are more than enough players in this game to always find an opponent in less than a minute but many potential players simply dont know about this game yet but it is safe to assume that bethesda will market this game much more as soon as all the mobile versions are released so it is probably just a matter of time my final rating a solid nine hundred and ten the game isnt perfect but there isnt much to improve the ranked rewards bother me a little and they could add some stuff to make the game look more interesting and diverse but aside from that it honestly is the best card game i have ever played and it is free to play so go ahead and try it yourself if you havent already enjoy
the game itself is nice but you need to put a lot of money to have content im only playing it at the moment because they offered me a coupon with some rvp ingame currency if you want other games like this i suggest race series project cars assetto corsa rfactor gamestockcar or grid autosport
graphic is not exceptional but the game is quite addictive and there are a lot of good ideas behind a great improvement to standard idle game where you do not have to think to much there are only two catastrophic problems for mac users one game reset to level one each time you restart2 game freeze every time you change windowproblems with the chat were also reported as it is it cannot be considered in beta testing but definitely still in alpha phase as soon as these issues are resolved the game could become really good t
if these survival games are any indication to the hope of humanity if an apocolypse comes we are all screwed if you manage to load up the game and get in game despite the freezelag problems most likely within your first 10ish minutes some guy is going to kill you for no reason the open world is nice not too hard to find items eventually but the game is still full up hackers many which it claims to be banning that the fun of it get taken out of it you try to hide from someone clearly out of view not moving yet they run straight at you as if they see you and then running doesnt matter every shot they shoot hits you would be a fun game if people didnt turn out to be straight aholes and full of hackers
this game was the single most boring thing i have ever played in my entire life my favourite part was how i could not shoot any of the animals i found because i hadnt paid for the game when i did find a deer i could shoot two hours into play i shot it it died and i dont really know what i was expected to feel joy accomplishment because at the end of the day all i felt was older and more tired
i liked how this game made you feel like a soldier like you really do feel like you are on another planet and destroying stuff with all your friends and buddies it is a game that really makes me feel like im important and like i have a goal to do something bigger than just the usual day to day struggle of life i recomend it to anyone with heart anyone who will take the time to appreciate the small things anyone who isnt a gigantic loser
bad admins banning people without care to explain and showing what the reasons only mentions their rules that they can banning anyone with or without reasons as long as they think that person is too rich in game
early access reviewi gave this game a chance and stuck it out through all the bugs class imbalances and all the little annoying things i watched it go from 45k players to 2k players in a month after waiting for changes that never happened me and others i know had to call it quits before wasting even more time in my last few days of playing the game i found myself mostly gathering for gold with the occasional dungeon party that wasnt my idea of a fun endgame pros actingcons neowiz purposely left out content thats in other versions of the gameclass imbalancecombat feels clunkycant tradelots of bugseasy to get stuck on terrainbad translationscant choose your own selling price in the auction houseauction house npc is only in a select few places in the worldtraveling somewhere takes foreverdungeon finder takes lumena to useendgame dungeon bosses drop gear at a very low chance making running dungeons feel not worth itqueue for battle grounds is glitchy and takes forever to get ini personally dont like the mount and pet stamina systemlumena marketplace doesnt have any thing worthwhile to buy same four costumes since the start of the game
early access reviewa few years ago it was a gaming title to behold after months of progressively worse updates and gameplay changes this is officially one of the worst games i have ever played i am officially pleased with one recent change involving the game its now removed from my games library never again
"a particually bad offender in respects to the person with better cards will win so you better grind but you have to grind against people with better decks or give us money in order to get the resorces to build a better deckand yes i am aware that the arena exists so you could grind there but in order to get the dark brotherhood and madhouse cards you need four thousand, five hundred gold in chunks of at least one thousand so if you grind in the arena the rate at which youll acumulate the gold for those cards will be hampered so much that you wont be getting any of them for a very long time"
with over five hundred and thirty nine hours and counting this game is alright my only complaint is the russian tanks planes the russian vehicles are way to over powered and have been for a while my tiger h took a direct hit to the turrent and i was knocked out in one shot even the developers have taken notice but refuse to do anything because they are ashamed of russian technology back then
oh planetside two how glorious you are massive two thousand player servers spread across three different continents and across three warring factions oh glory be being a f2p game free to play you dont have a reason to at least not try the game out that is if your computer can handle it previously the game was extremely poorly optimized for amd cpus and t hat has recently changed where i was once getting twelve frames in large biodome fights im now giving it fortyfive bonus points now the game is an infantryvehicular combat game the three factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier you use infantry resources same goes with c4 personal medkits and the highly useful and badass max suits vehicles take the apropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it cost more now the three factions are all similar yet very different both aesthetically and performance wise the new conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the vannu sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy no bullet drop but dow low damage each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well now planetside two is a freetoplay title but dont let that scare you away most games have a paytowin model to be more precise whre as long as you just dump money into the game you will have much improved gear over others and this is why most f2p games fail but not ps2 the only thing real money is good for in ps2 is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowence of five hundred sc station cash per month and an xp and cert bonus certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while sc is used to purchase weapons skipping the arning of certs as well as customization options such as camos helmets and emblems on your soldier and vehicles you can not buy certs outright which is where the balancing is each weapoin can be moddified heavily with weapoin attatchments which alter their performance drastically from 1x red dot sights to 20x sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips it all depends these are purchased using certs you earn one cert per one thousands xp in game while the weapon may be bought with sc and skip the one thousands cert price point the attachments must be earned through play i know this review is all over the place but if you like fpss on a massive scale skip that battlefield four sixtyfour player nonsense and jump right inot an amazing free game planetside two
the worst game dev group ever never listen to the community and never fix things filled with hackers which the devs have no idea of how to deal with basicly a good game that got spoiled by the devs
early access reviewworst magic the gathering clone i have ever played minimum deck size is seventyfive cards which makes the ratio of getting your best cards smaller than in other ccgs mana flood seems to be worse in this game than others i have played i enjoy the influence mechanic but other than that you can find in other games just about anything you find in this one play infinity wars play hex play mtg play anything but this waste of time
after logging almost nine hundred hours into this game and being a willing white whale to it as well it breaks my heart to say that i can no longer to recommend this game when i first started this game the grinding was still fairly large but could be bypassed by paying for their premium currency did this giving you an advantage yes and no yes because you were able to get the best gear and no because you still had to learn how to play the game at this time i had the most fun with this game because i didnt have a lot of time to grind everything out then the devs came out with an update that made it so you had to go and grind everything or pay a lot of money to upgrade the one ribbon you needed to get the lastest and greatest thing i can understand why they did this but as someone who loved the game but hated the grinding this frustrated me a lot i decided a while back to take a break from this game and just see if the game would add more content that would make the grinding much more bearable after about two years i get into the game to see that they added med kid with a new ribbon to grind to get better things a couple new plane for each faction some newer pistols for each faction and one new map to me this doesnt really justify the grinding needed in this game to get some more of the better weapons that said even the starting rifle can be upgraded to make it top tier with grinding it tldr once was a great game till lack of new content and the endless grinding got old
i obviously have enjoyed this game for some time it is the most realistic hunting game on the market real hunters will have a true advantage over gamers that dont hunt the graphics and sceneries are beautiful thirtyseven different species and eleven reserves to hunt and the devs are always working on more weekly updates the subscription is very cheap around three dollars a month its relaxing and exciting at times tons of competitions and missions to earn in game money and trophies for free players there are three species you can always hunt whitetail pheasants and european rabbits and they rotate two other species every week for you to hunt for free you can also join multiplayer games to hunt with your buddies its deffinetly worth checking out if you would like info on how i pay for my items and membership without spending my own money please check my profile
this game is amazing i agree the graphics could be better but overall the story chatacters and the dragons are great i recommended this game for my sibling and she loved it one thousand and ten
a boring clone of clicker heroes with samey art of anime monster girls which include but are not limited to multiple varities of girl dressed as cat girl dressed as dog girl dressed as bird and girl dressed as girl progression is slow and cumbersome the abilities dont have keyboard shortcuts and the sound design is generic also nearly half the options are microtransaction whoring and the games artists patreon if you need to look at anime s go on the internet if you want to play a clicker game go play something else
if you have a rift cv1 you need to try this sim out one of the best vr experiences to date with a hotas and rudder controls its out of this world be sure to set the display settings in the games display options to the vr preset otherwise you may experience some frame stuttering issues when you move your head around not only is the vr experience great but the simulation physics and flight feel great havent seen a flight sim this good since falcon forty or fsx
great for learning but after unlocking the sixth or something gun you have to grind a lot to reach the next one so it gets in the way if your goal is to learn something new youre stuck there spamming the same guns then after all that grind you get a new gun learn all the parts like in a few minutes and back to grinding
i am an original planetside player and played fanatically three years after ps2 released and i finally have a computer that could run it so i just had to give it a try i miss some of the old mechanics but the heart of the game is there i even bought a three month daybreak pass for the genes and to support the game and have found it well worth it very enjoyable with some great firefights to be had even on off hours i had a real tough time for my first few hours but after you get last the learning curve there is a ton of fun to be had here i havent even fired up my mic yet just killing vanu and the red menace and enjoying the zerg give it a shot you wont regret it
early access reviewwalk down corridor walk through door walk through room find door walk down hall way cardboard cut out pops and says hello walk through next door find note on table and run for your life run run run run run run run run run run bam a ing cardboard cut out ing scared me wtf awsome fun creepy funny game dont drink the wine
it is a good game but the steering is difficult and there is not much customisation towards the start of the gamelike more than one car and one track they should take a leaf out of forza motorsports book
early access reviewthis game is amazing it loads fast and the mechanics are amazing if they would add skins for weapons and add characters and other addons it would even be more amazing
"this game may seem cute adorble and innocent at first with the cute scary pops outs every now and again i was glad to see a spooky scary skeleton but things got a little dark when there was notes laying around and a demon like ghost following you where ever you go until a certian point that is not to memtion that there are some deadends and tons of spooks if youre into horror running away types you might like this dispite it being looking like it was made for kids when it wasnt id say one thousand, one hundred and twelve maybe but all in all i enjoy it its not alone in the dark or any other scary horror like that its as the title says spookys house of jump scares and oh boy im pretty spooked and im not joking this game actually gave me goosebumps"
tough learning curve but worth learning no other game can match the scale of these fps battles team play and tactics are very important in this game millions of ways to play and very open world as long as you dont get lit by the enemy community is very good and a good source of knowledge if you are new youtube channels recommended attlas993 for tactics wrel for reviews tips etc not pay2win as weapons are mostly sidegrades and the defualt weapons are very competitive already overall a very fun game if you can get into the right fights find your playstyle find your right outfit and learn a bit about the game
this is one of those games that either wears off reeeeeeeally fast or draws you so far in you cant stand to be away from your vault for too long for me it wore off just after the first week there is terrible balance in this game very unforgiving and seldom rewarding when you ask for assistance via the forums everyone tells you the same thing dont get more than fortynine dwellers until each and every dweller has a freakin legendary weapon and outfit basically dont play the game best thing you can do is build about six rooms get a mister handy put a diner power plant and water treatment on the same floor and simply never play again radscorpions will stop your game solid and whats worse if yo utake too long to defeat one as soon as you do kill it another oine spawns right after the other draining power faster than mole rats draining health quickly aaaaaaaaand dealing radiation damage whats the official solution dont exceed fortynine dwellers want to rush the medbay at twenty five chance after a sequence of repeated radscorpion attacks too bad that twenty five is all it took and it failed the punishment a radscorpion attack have fun i recommend the game to try but i dont recommend playing past the first week the game runs on real time meaning everything matters because you have to wait real time for things to happen and it takes less than five seconds for all that work and progress to drop dead everything you know about fallout the armor the weapons you can forget about all that because only special applies if you so much as stand in a room with an enemy in the room on the other end of the room you will steadily lose health andor gain radiation damage expand your vault but do not progress kinda an oxy moron isnt it because morons are the ones who programmed this asinine combat system while a quirky little human ant farm it has much work to be done before it is polished and becomes actually fun sadly the forum community finds their illogical solutions more reasonable than admiting the fact that the game might just be flawed and needs a few patches if only just better ingame instruction ill keep playing it for a few minutes a day ill give it that much of a chance but so far after ignorantly evicting about seven perfectly useful dwellers in hope of curbing the radscorpion madness i had a molerat attack that spread faster than i could assign dwellers to the room the result was half the vault dying as the mole rats were in every single room except the overseers office and i couldnt possibly keep tabs on every single dweller happieness went from ninety six to eighty two in less than a moment not to mention the dwellers were still recoverign from the previous two consecutive radscorpion attacks in whihc the medbay was drained of all its stimpacks fighting that one christ the game needs work some game mechanics need some changes no one gives a molerats about my opinion though im pretty sure on bethesdas perspective as long as they get people buying their glorious quantums and lunchboxes they probably wont do anything about the game balanceplay by our rules wuss we are right and you are wrong
after you stay half a hour to realize how to enter in a game you will stay in a very long loading screen with an idiot music you spawn already killed and you need to wait very long to respawn
product received for freeearly access revieware you kidding me random drops instead of just being able to buy everything with in game currency this is beyond stupid how can the devs give this small amount of crap about their community does anyone know a game similar to this one but with good devs
nine hundred and ten would suggest this game to any and all types of gamers dota two is the perfect game what with its disgusting fan basecommunity and its highly addictive nature that will ruin your life if you enjoy pushing aside your responsibilities and loved ones in order to achieve a six hour meth binge this is the game for you given nine due to the lack of pictures of gaben ingame
early access reviewgood game its fun basically a moba with space ships it does however appear to suffer from terrible performance for a lot of users and i personally had an incredibly laggy and jittery experience its definitely worth playing but it would be a lot better without the lag i may try to do a reinstall mess with settings etc to see if that helps with the lag later on
in my opinion this is one of the best multiplayer shooters available today there is something for everyone wheter it be tank driving air battles support wether as medic or fungineer platoonsquad leader or just walking around shooting people no matter what you do you will fall in love with this game and its community and everytime you boot the game up and join a platoon you will remeber why download and play it now you will not regret itunless you are extremely impatient and cannot tolerate death
im großen und ganzen ganz nett verliert aber schnell an motivation pay2win flair wäre es nicht kostenlos würd ichs nicht spielen was mir gefällt ist dass sich das blatt wirklich schnell wenden kann kartenglück halt entweder man hats oder man hat es nicht bin mit magic the gathering aufgewachsen da kommt das spiel nicht wirklich ran die arena ist in meinen augen ein witz man spielt mit einem mehr oder weniger zufälligen deck ein falscher klick und man hat eine falsche karte ausgewählt und das deck wird dadurch deutlich schwächer ich würd da kein geld reinstecken jetzt is es noch spielbar aber in ein paar monaten oder wochen haben viele kids ihr taschengeld in gute karten gesteckt und dann wirds fad das gute ist man kann gegen eine ki spielen fazit nett für zwischendurch nichts auf dauer
i love this game i play this game two years since version one hundred on android spend time for collecting gems and spend money for open the box but your choice to banned sr card and a card fron structure box is too crazy so now i think must stop playing this game i cant follow your mind good job konamisorry i must saythis game only for rich player new box new bannedlistsorry for my bad english
early access reviewdo not waste your time or moneythe resource mechanic absolutely ruins an otherwise fantastic game the art style is amazing the lore is amazing the impact each of the cards have and the balance between archetypes is amazing none of that matters if you cant actually play the game and thats exactly what happens in the majority of games you either draw way too many resource cards but no units to spend them on or no resources at all the amount of games where a eleven minion has slowly whittled down methe opponent is absurd there are plenty of other games out there with cool art and lore that actually let you play them
this game runs like and seems like it would be full of annoying ten year olds i say seems because i cant load into the friggin world and it crashed constantly do not get this game
early access reviewwhat are you waiting for two more days remain to get this game for free its in alpha and has some bugs but has been pretty fun you havent played a real br game till you get panned by someone wearing bunny slippers and winged kneepads of speed
its yugioh if you like the real thing then youll like this duel links uses the speed dual format so matches go much faster then your average duel you gets tons of free stuff when you first start so pick your favorite deck and make it easily
early access reviewbrawlhalla is a rather fun and interesting game to play with your friends not so much fun playing online alone it is almost identical to super smash bros and the feeling is really great from what i have played it is a lot of fun to just mess around with friends in a custom game
early access reviewi started playing this game no twenty sixteens of august with one of my friends at first i was searching for minecraft but looking at the price my friends would probably not want to invest the money on minecraft which left me buying the game and play alone is not fun at all then i keep searching and discover creativese which is what free and i suggested it to my friends and we started playing we enjoy a lot of this game especially during exploration of ore for crafting purpose and fighting monster the feel of around my friend is really good in this game caused we can interact together the graphics though was great either what i really feel bad about this game is only when i reach the bottom level of the game it self and got nothing to explore anymore it will make the game not really enjoyable since basically we had seen everything in this game when we go to other caves it will still be the same item again which is getting boring after we had found the deepest thing in this game will keep playing this game again with my friends if there are any update regarding more exploration not another block update since i dont craft that much i prefer exploration seeing things that are new which can lead me and my friends keep playing overall the game is so good before you reach the deepest part of the layer i recommended playing this
refreshing new take on the infestation title or so i thought pros new items weapons and attachments skins galore vehicles market new game modes and maps cons anticheat dosnt work worth a damn bans cheat users after the fact meaning they will always cheat kill some players then get banned always have players clipping through walls and floors to kill you with esp precision complete bull for pvp search google thousands of results for infestation the newz cheats youtube over five hundred recent videos of hacks ingame devs defend this game and say there is no cheaters only very good players yeah ok then meanwhile all the legit players are quiting this game really wanted to like this game but without fair pvp its just boring
free to payas much as id like to love this game because i love the movies i just cant the game falls very short in my opinion for two main reasons the first is that at times the controls can be frustratingly cumbersome especially during flight sometimes it takes a while to register a turn or boost but maybe this is just due to timing the second is that youre bombarded with advertisements for membership additional perks and boosts which im really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself i dont mind a bit of advertising these however are in your face particularly on the loading screens which i like to contain useful ingame information such as hints or history theres nothing wrong with micropurchasing in a game its down to how well its presented that counts and unfortunately it seems that a lot of the items or areas are unlockable only if you pay thereby limiting the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore while you can explore freely to an extent its pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next one good thing about the game is that you can choose between solo and multiplayer but after awhile it becomes samey and i quickly lost interest sad because it has the potential to be a great game

early access reviewbroken want to play a game itll get you in one but it will break straight away and will send you back to deployment screen and not allow you to do anything furthermore the grinding to get anywhere is unreal
what can be said about this game that hasnt already been said nothing really but here goes nothing its kinda a diablo two clone but does have its own original gamestyle is it fun hells yes is it worthy schwing is it worth it um lets see free i would say yes if you are an arpg fan than jump on the wagon train and ride this puppy cuz your probably not gonna find a better free game of this genre
this game is a p2w game or better know as pay to win and i say this because if you dont buy like a rank or anything like that you have to spend countless hours more then if you pay
solo arena is really unbalanced some games are guaranteed losses if they get to start with a creature and its purple or better you lose if they have a weenie deck and one of the lane convertstoanimals you lose if the final boss has a 1dmgaturn starter and you dont have the mana ring you lose very frustrating to draft a good deck and lose
"you can get cheated out of your purchases i bought gold and paid four thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine and it never showed up in my game and they claim everything is ok on their end and refered me to a third party game developer which got me nowhere"
a great fighting game that can even run on a low spec pc what kills is that its almost a pay two win game its a great game to play i also played grand chase too which is about seventyfive percent similar to this dragon nest is also another game you could try a great game to kill time but still looks pay two win and also the items are kinda limited time
there used to be a game called dota two then a new patch seven hundred came out and turned it into a copy of league of legends that patch changed almost every aspect of the game i liked it the way it was
warning reader discretion is advisedcaution this review has slight violence that others may find offensive i myself do not condone selfharm ok my experience absolutley disappointing i got that giant battlefield i was wanting wide open spaces and fresh air until some guy shoots you from half a mile away that is let me tell you something you have absolutely no idea what helplessness is until youve entered the wrong zone with someone who lives a lightyear away seriously i pull out a rocket launcher when i was heavy infantry and shoot the guy in the face seems normal all is cool yeah nah he whips out a knife and stabs me while i shoot him in the face that rocket he ate it and those bullets i unloaded into the guy never left my barrel i suppose youd think that youd be able to dominate and be stealthy in this game was an infiltrator at the time while all of the other infantry risk their lives for a point no not really theres always that one guy you should know him no how about a brief reminder hes that one guy who is always looking for you no matter where you are he will find you and murder you because one of his friends told him that you dont like his new axe body spray and hes super selfconsciousi would love to tell you the story of all my failures but nobody is gonna wanna read that scidoodle so heres a summary you got good internet play if not please find a garbage can proceed to stab yourself not too much just enough to bleed out in a good few minutes and throw yourself in the trash just think of all the good youd be doing for example i wouldve gotten to experience the game to its fullest extent with friends along with all those other people you scared away because of your internets absurd temper qa q im a veteran player with five hundred hrs and never experienced this problem a i envy you you little sh next questionq was it possible that it was your side a if it was me id stop playing and find something better to do im currently paying for the best internet i can getq is it possible that you just suca blahblahbla ladeedlala i cant hear youq what are the specs on your computer a good nuff i can run the game at ultraq whos that guy a youre joking right we just went over this q youve only got an hour and a half into the game why judge it so harshly a games good but you might want to have a couple friends people i met were awfulq why do you recommend the game despite you not liking it a lets get real this game is good if you had not played it yet i suggest you try it when you have the chance i may not play it for a while a long while but when i get time ill definitely come back for more when ive got some friends gathered q what would you rate this ten a seven hundred and ten opinion may vary through further gameplayplease if you are reading this and have yet to play this game get some friends your first impression will be way better that way and tell joel to stop downloading his female chests since im not allowed you use profanity youll have to deal with chest and if you caught this reference kudos to youi may not answer review meqa very bad friend and some random guy who said he didnt want credit for the top question
early access reviewarguably one of the best ccgs on steam combines the visual aesthetic is similar to hearthstone but the game plays a lot more like magic the gathering i have well over two hundred hours on this game and i dont see myself stopping anytime sooneternal has a balanced meta and card mechanics that could not be implemented in a typical trading card game this game truly is refined and constantly evolving highly recommend this game
i used to play this game alot back in twenty sixteens when it was in early access but ever since the game officially launched it seems to lag more but the over all game is great the sound design is good the graphics are impressive for its style but the game is at its best when you are surviving along side your friends and trying to go out grap resources and build a base to defend yourself the game is a true masterpiece in its survival elements which youll have tones of fun with as i love survival games like this where you have to grap resources and plan when you want to go on a supply run and ifyou go alone you an have your friend working on your base because i was with my friend and we made a beach house and connect it to are base in a mine so i woud say give the game a try and if you dont like it thats fine and if you do like it thats fine too its all your opinion
this new yugioh game with new rules new shity cards sucks but it is still better than heartstoneps i still like yugioh with eight thousands hp and five cards fields some cards are meant to played when there are five space on the field and some cards are only useable when you start the game with 8000hp
early access review enjoyable ccg with some flaws borrows ui visual design and quality of life features from hearthstone while moving the design space forward in satisfying ways card combinations can be very powerful allowing for more interesting deck building options single player options are interesting but lacking longterm replayability opting instead to drive players to pvp battles while this makes sense when considering the genre there is unmined opportunity that eternal seems primed to exploit upcoming expansions look ready to offer more single player options suffers from resource randomness the big challenge in eternal is the very poor system governing resource draw resource cards are included and then drawn from your deck like magic hex etc and there seems to be something wrong with eternals deck randomization system it is common to encounter resource glut sometimes drawing nothing but resource cards during a single match while a hand redraw guarantees two resource cards resource drought is also common while i understand the wish of the design team to stay true to their magic roots the competitive digital ccg space demands design systems that optimize the player experience and while hearthstones steady resource gain system seems to take some of the life out of the ccg experience it balances the competitive experience in a critical way imagine for example if eternal had a steady resource gain mechanic with a random color draw that could determine the type of the resource drawn this random draw could still be based on a number of resources included during deck building while helping mitigate the gamebreaking randomness of resource draw while the resource issue is enough to keep me from spending a ton of money on eternal i have enjoyed the rest of the game if youre looking for a game with a strong mtg feel but with a mostly modern design approach to the digital ccg genre i think eternal is a good choice
early access reviewthis game makes me think of super smash bros and im really enjoying it so far and i will continue to play and will look forward to new legends maps and updates
early access reviewdevelopers pushing stuff that couldve been designed by their little cousin because they can sell a mini campaign with a buyin super pushed creature removable mostly by its own colors makes the ladder which is bo1 a mind numbingly boring experience since almost everyone and their dog wanting to climb plays that card either because its good or because the same colors are needed to remove it cant wait till someone wants to make money by making a good card game rather than make money with dubious buy this powercreep here guise type deals shame because theres obviously talent here but design decisions tell me all i need to know what matters isnt where you are its which direction youre going and this isnt going in any good direction got banned and lost all account access after posting this review lol the upside is it got me in the mood to try faeria which turned out to be a straight up a better card game
developers should advertise a little better the paytoplay mechanics involved what looks to be a promising timeconsumer with usp mechanics turns out to be a rather frustrating and unclear experience that ended up putting me off a big and immediately evident downfall is that you cant host a game with your friends without paying for the privilege so you have to join an existing server on which youll find you are not able to actually shoot at anything due to the paytoplay hunting license mechanic im by no means against paytoplay but dont lie to me this shouldnt really be advertised as free to play in its entirety some single player hunting enthusiasts may get some enjoyment out of it but for multiplayer with your mates unless youre looking to sink some cash into it this aint free to play
early access reviewi love this game the fact that you keep every card you use in draft and forge makes it worth buying into them whether with gold or real cash it is so easy to earn gold in this game im already halfway to earning enough to buy jekks bounty without ever putting a cent into the game itself
its quite clear that the only branch given any love whatsoever is the soviet branch the battle rating system which is used to balance the matchmaking is heavily biased towards soviet medium tank drivers this system also completely breaks heavy tanks where they are placed in battles full of weapons that can easily penetrate their heavy armor thus defeating the purpose of a heavy tank if you are looking for an historically accurate ww2 vehicle warfare simulator this is not it tanks and aircraft particularly heavy tanks will never face in an online battle what they actually faced during the era in which they were used
the game as it is is pretty good i would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent events are just tedious mind numbing grinding a recent event required you to do over one hundred games within three days to get a tank or plane or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for forty bucks ground forces tanks is even more grinding than air forces it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money the ground forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank for example you have to research fire extinguishers that can take a decent amount of games especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank while you watch being unable to do anything or well you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money you have to train your crew not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to six crew members in tanks you have to train every single one of them individually or you spend some bucks on them air rb battles are unchanged since the game came out they are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks you often come out with just as much sl in game currency to buy stuff as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs their balancing methods are just bad instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank or plane for that matter for months again naval forces have been in closed access meaning you have to pay to play them for over a year now in the steam screenshots you can see uboats there are no uboats in the game they only have been in the game for one day april foolsthe list goes on thats just what i have in my mind right now you can take a look at more posts like these rwarthunder general rantrwarthunder about repair costsrwarthunder about their horrible prrwarthunder about repair costs ii
if you dont mind paying up to instantly unlock everything this game is fine however when they match brand new players with four towers to select and half the upgrades locked out against people who can fully upgrade with all the towers at their disposal its just not fun time and patience is finite so i will not be grinding through a metric ton of unbalanced match ups and i cant see blowwing money on this kind of garbage set up so uninstalled
early access revieweternal is a fun game except for one thing and its a big one they need to fix how many or how few power cards are drawn in a row during a game winning or loosing a game because all you received were power cards or nonpower cards is not only not fun but there is no strategy involved you get to watch the other player kill you or you get to kill them without much pushback i havent played a day yet where i won or lost due to this issue the game is really fun but extremely frustrating when this occurs i have repeatedly left feedback without any responses i cannot recommend this game for that reason there are too many other games that are more fun to play these days
basic mechanics similar with heartstone but some diffirences to like board is split from mid to forty four max eight minion for each player left lane is field lane right lane is shadow lane right lane is completely basic but shadow lane gives stealth for one turn stealth minions cant be targeted by enemy minions but can be targeted by actions supports battlecry and deathrattle effects and unlike heartstone when you summon a battlecry minion with another way than playing like evolve you can use battlecry game is pay to win of course but with daily quests and monthly claim rewards its easy to make money game dont have very much expansions yet but slowly more coming game got story modes three part each one costs one thousands gold are pretty fun to play i highly recommend the game if you like this kind of card games
so currently i only have around twentyfour hours and i am in the third out of four acts this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind path of exile is fantastic every steam owner should at one point or another try this game however it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around seven hours to get there for me at least this game is basically the paladins to diablo personally i think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points art stylein act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage i personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired nasty depressing backgrounds thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act three being the nicest looking act thusfar diablo i think should be a keymark for this just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play poe is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at progressionok this is purely opinion based but i will try to be as objective as possible diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there in this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds in poe it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online that being skills are merely items that you equip this system allows for much more creativity but can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players in my personal opinion i think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion howeverpoe wins in the costumazation department purely because of the passive skill tree holy crap this skill tree no barriers locked behind class walls all classes can have any passive that is so refreshing rarely ever do i see games do this and i still have no idea why gameplaythis is an action rpg meaning prepare yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat not really much to say other then that its very fast paced overall this is a must play i intend to progress farther and play for engame content
early access reviewused to play this game a lot because it was fun it was fun grinding games to get myself a set of the best armor and watch as all of my bots slowly turn black the color of the highest tier armor back then they removed the tiers and all my grinding went to waste i am okay with that because the armor was cheap and i could buy literally millions of them after every match because i was using a megabot they then removed megabots i was sad but the game was still fun to play there were things to build and things to look forward to my efforts in game was reflected in my rewards after every match now the rewards are no longer really based on skill its all rng now you could do the best in the entire match and get worse rewards than the player on the bottom of the scoreboard you dont get money anymore so you have to rely on rng to get the item you want instead of just saving up tldr rewards in game are based on rng instead of an earnmoneybuyitem the rates are worse than a japanese waifu phone game your efforts in game no longer match your reward
i am primarily a lol player but lately i have been interested in other mobas i took a look at dota two and smite and smite is a very interesting game right away you notice a huge difference between it and other mobas being the over the shoulder perspective i love this because it allows people to sneak up on enemies for ganks the game is easy to run like other mobas so that isnt a concern im not a big fan of the oversexualization in this game but its tolerable i very much recommend this game to casual and more competetive gamers just because of how easy to run and deep it is if you like classic mobas but arent the biggest fan of the birds eye view this is perfect for you i think you should try it out if you arent sure its free so you have nothing to lose edit reading other reviews ignore the people complaining about the community if you want to play an online game they all have communities if you really cant stand the community play with your friends do normal games and add the decent people to play with them again
i love this game i play it with some of my family members and they share the same views its a family freindly game simple to the point where almost every one can pick it up and with some harder to master aspects such as me spending twenty mins trying to find the teleporter in the crafting menu then screeming when i noticed the search bar dunno maby thats just me but my point is almost any one can pick it up and its fun for most sadly with any of these types of games theres a limmit to how much fun you can have for an avid gamer like myself i spend most days not getting up from the pc and if i do it can only mean one of three things im beeing screemed at to eat somthing im going to watch doctor who or im late for school as allways anyways i reccomend to play this game with freinds and family alike and most of all have fun and note rading freinds dose not go down well
neverwinter is massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg its a free to play game which means you dont have to buy the game to play it but there is the option to buy game packs which give you certain in game items that make the game easier to play you can also buy items in the game with real money to obtain otherwise unobtainable items although you can spend real money you dont have to you can level your characters up in the game and find some special items just by playing for free the in game graphics are obviously dependant on your graphics card but on my 770gtx the graphics are very smooth and detailed one issue i do have with the game is it can be laggy when there are a lot of players on one map my internet connection is fibre at 40mb and i never get any less than 33mbs down and 8mbs up so the lag is certainly not my connection cryptic just dont have enough server spacespeed to cope at times i would certainly recommend this game if you like role playing games and to be able to play for free if you want to is fantastic in my opinion
this is a mobile game port over to pc so as expected its a waiting simulator with some time saving purchase options its like farmville from facebook meets fallout interesting little time wasting gamethat being said its well done well coded and mildly entertaining go into this game knowing its a waste of time and pretty basic and youll probably enjoy it510 free pc game810 for a mobile game
early access reviewone of the best f2p shooters out there not pay to win at all anyone who says that is completely idiot you can get any weapon with ingame currency there arent any super op weapons each works differently got different spray pattern you just need to learn how to control it battle match is my favorite mode but it should have more maps there are only three available for now it looks decent enough allthough it could use some optimization in that one hundred and twenty hours ive never met any cheaters still i can read loads of t reviews about how the game is crowded by them
generic clicker game that adds a little more flavor and pleasing asthetics to the mix like most clicker games you have plenty of ways to increase your coinsclick and idletimepassive gains in this the difficulty curve is more pleasing because you start with a set of spells to jumpstart your game you gain monster coins on a chance per click basis and plenty of paths for upgrading your coin gains pros f2p you can put money into the game but from what i gather you wont want to until higher tier buildings much later on asthetically pleasing clicker open well enough so you can see your growth plenty of tasks that keep progression interestingcons no sounds no music only the sound of my mouse clicking frantically long gaps of waiting time between progression at the end of the day its just another clicker gametldr 710one of the better clicker games out there right now imo its not just a screen to click on yes it is but you can see progression and get your tasks done in a fairly reasonable amount of time like most clicker games just have a lot of patience and dont expect too much
early access reviewwell it was pretty good when i started playing but theyre doing the typical hirez thing already and doing the exact opposite of what the community wants game also already has a store button ready to go so id assume itll be p2w any time now like they did with every single other game theyve ever made if youre interested play it now because its probably only gonna get worse their latest patch not only removed the one thing that made their br game unique it also buffed weapons that were already op and were supposed to be nerfed and now you can shoot people through corners with them
early access reviewwell as an early access game this one already shows a promising futureas as well as some problemsthis game is surely made to mock some other and it did it its purely simple and good spawning is random and looting is fun thats good enough for me plus its free
after a number of hours in game it randomly deleted my save file without any fix seeming to be in sight apparently is just an issue this game can have dont invest any time or especially money into this game
the only freetoplay ive ever played that isnt paytowin and is of high quality i dont always play a lot of freetoplay but when i play freetoplay i play path of exile
"never ever even consider downloading this bs of a game ive wasted like 05k hrs like only getting an understanding of what is happening and what consecutive inputs should i perform not to be yelled at and after some time when ive figured out what to do i still get yelled at cuz my teammates are in almost every game either toxic pieces of or just with single digit iq every game you try your best you do a lot better then your teammates do but these boys just decide to stay afk cuz why tf not just believe me and never install this thing this game is pure evil genuine source of frustration which gave terrible headache to anyone whod ever tried dota if you like to lose your like to scream at the screen and argue with ppl youll never ever see in your life its your choice one thousand, one hundred and ten"
the current state of bless is lacking in many of its content compared to the time given to develop price tag and relative success in other areas in my opinion heres the facts the game though pretty fun early on lack content for late game the game lacks content especially when compared to with the jap version although updates and content are being added its just too slow and little the royal quests and gem fragments are not worth it compared to the effort needed some of community is leaving so that is going to leave a void for groups and pvp for a new player is very unfriendly with a community of hardcore gamers who will never help instead of helping newcommers they will do a five man dungeon with twenty three ppl because most of the ppl left are way way too overgeared but they want more because is nothing else to do i guess also big guilds recrute ppl not to help them but to find players to boost guild points terrible community if youre looking to get this game hold off until the price comes down to ten or less i hope for the people that did spend a lot of money steam will give a refund not only to the streams but to all for such a blunder but i am not holding my breath
ive been playing this game off and on for about four years now i keep coming back for every league every three months and play nonstop for about a month until im burned out the developers really try to come up with new and exciting things every league its a game i really like to support ive been a vivid diablo two three player for many years but diablo three as much as i love it has nothing on this game constant updates quick bugfixing active community make this game a masterpiece
it makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win there is nothing in this game that you have to buy there are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players ive been playing this game since back when there were only four classes and it has evolved and plays beautifully the items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply there are costumes which granted are expensive but you dont need them at all they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway there are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier pve experience the only thing that i can say is a usual must pay is the second b slot which shouldnt be a paid thing but if youre going to enjoy and play the game a lot then whats eight other than that you dont have to buy anything ive never expanded my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy now to the gameplay its an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2d side scrolling with 3d elements it has a unique combo system between its attack buttons and skills and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style each character currently in the game has three jobs to choose from each of which greatly alters your characters play style all and all the games pve is superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo now for the pvp its a very fun experience whether youre casual or hardcore going into it its very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against it comes in the form of 1v1 2v2 3v3 and a base race game mode where it falls short sometimes is its balance playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times but its nothing that practice and effort cant solve the biggest issue that ive had with this game is latency there will be random moments in pve where ill be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in pvp along with an enemy lag teleporting around but it all usually sorts itself out overall i believe that this is a great mmo that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new
early access reviewfun and addictive just like super smash bros it has wellbalanced characters and fun modes the extra party modes are very fun to play especially dodgebomb youll be sure to have lots of laughs with your friends all this for free
this is a good game it is the closest thing you will get to real life hunting because you dont just see a deer every three feet so for those who say it is bad go on a real hunting trip then you will understand
i cant even start the game because of battleye he says he blocks the file wow64dll hours spend trying to fix this without any resultfr je ne peux juste pas le lancer à cause de battleye qui me dit quil bloque le fichier wow64dll des heures à essayer de fixer ça sans résultat
this game started out as a very fun exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing but now that theyve patched and updated several more times it has lost its fun factor due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed levels etc without paying money i started playing while they still had levelled planes and such and that was when you could buy the planes without research points which now you have to buy with real money and so youre stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy one plane one youd think that you could buy two or maybe three but when you play a battle your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles so if you get this game and think youre going to coast through to the top level be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there
well there is no need to tell you much about this game its just so popular many people consider this game as a piece of artwork true is that it needs a lot of skills to be good in it to be honest its just not my type of game anyway i recommend to try
ive recently been seeing all these paid youtube videos about how great this game is which in fact its not clunky movement floaty jumps insane nade spam problem in all game modes if you want to get somewhere in a reasonable time youll have to pay heaps of money p2w p2w p2w sure you can play it completely free of charge but it will not be fun and i would never encourage anyone to spend a single dime on this game
"pray to rngesus before entering each match pray to the snail god and pray to the isis six the game is fun till fifty seven that is the tier of the paytowin tanks go to sixty seven more than fifty of the teams you are with or against are premiums the is6 isnt op you can still kill it from the frontguy with sabot or heatfs to everyone else who doesnt have that i love this game i want it to be fun but i have been geting contiuously screwed with rng and just plain old fashion bullstary also one thing i noticed it is usually a roflstomp in one way or the other one thousand, one hundred chance of having an even match fields of normany is cancer look left look right look left move die pretty much how most games go the snail god needs your offereings to get ahead by buying bushes for your tank becuase thats apparently not an advantage but it does give you an advantage release the damn ships already thats pretty much all im waiting on once i know thats cancer too then i will quit for good this game is really like a drug you love it it only treats you bad but gives you some good kicks not enough keep you but it is so damn hard to leave edit one for people who like stats or whatever i doesnt matter if i get twelve kills or two killsmostly play ground rb or air rb if your team is trash it doesnt matter how good you are i have eight hundred and thirty victories out of twentyseven sixtynines games thats pathetic i dont understand why my team always loses so much it doesnt make sense at all i dont recommend this unless you currently have friends to play with you the grind is real once you get to fifty seven area and you will needs friends in order to help each not fall down the pits of rngesusedit 04102018the new meta dont have fun be fast"
i was on the fence about tryng this game which does not make any sense since its free i felt like it would be a demo deal where you pay to unlock content but that is not the case the only things i have seen that you can pay for are already available in the world where you just pay for minor convienence or for asthetic stuff or things that are cool but completely unneccesary i have never played minecraft so i dont know how it compares other than the fact that im not willing to plunk down the money to try minecraft there are two things i really like about this game other than the exploreexpand and sandbox aspects the first thing i like is that you must constantly protect yourself which makes the game very immersive at nightfall things become a bit more dangerous than during the day so your base and its security are very important it also makes exploring challenging since you must decide to fight on through the night or set up a temporary camp you will find yourself underpressure to use what you have available to quickly build shelter and waiting for daybreak there will be lots to do while in your base so you will not be idle to gather more resources and improve your base i find myself constantly racing against the clock and taking incremental improvement where i can the second thing i like is just how massive the world is it will take you a very long time to get from one end of the map to the other and im not sure how long it would take to explore the whole map but not the amout of time i have with a full time job for me this makes this game have a long burn rate which is really important for me since i get bored quickly with games there are many other good things about this game but it just boils down to the fact that it is a well thought through game with a lot of content and endless possibilities not something i would expect from a free to play game i enjoy this as much as i enjoy runesscape and eve online but both those games have extremely limited free to play versions which is fine the idea is if you like it then pay for it very unlike this game i think there could be more documentation but as of writing this the game is very new im also more a fan of user generated documentation than manualstutorias so this will improve with time
early access reviewi got this game solely for my brother the training course gives you the op guns but when you get the class you equip bb guns the next issue i have is that this is wwii based and yet we are battling the ussr get your facts right we did hate the commies but they were our ally in this war the new update has made it impossible for u s to win due to the spamming of tanks that are almost impenetrable conclusion this game is still in beta and shows alot of promise if they fix the game mechanincs and balanced the classes and vehicles this may just may be agood game until then i ask those who care about historical battles to wait until the creators of the game fix these issues
the game itself is very well built its hard to come by a n ice sidescroller game with so many options with skill trees job classes and other things that are so small but make such a huge difference biggest problem for me is the fact that if you want to win in this game you need to donate the game is fun casual play but as for wanting to get better its all in how much you pay to win skill only takes you so far in it the community itself has gone very downhil since the game started as well now its full of trolls and people with giant egos thanks to how much theyve spent on it reason why i make i recommend it is if you can look past the pvp and dungeon things it has some nice events to help you reach max level some challenging dungeons and you dont need to party with strangers its great to play with friends as for trying to playing play it competitively unless youre willing to spend a ton of cash i wouldnt recommend it
you have to be an enthusiast to enjoy this it is also quite a good memory game how to put things together and to make them work it is not a shooter game as such but a game that some gun enthusiast would enjoy the mechanics of the whole thing work just fine abeit some areas could be improved for instance it will only put parts together that are next on the list it is not quite real when putting a gun together for real there are different approaches you could take but only some will work correctly otherwise the controls are working just fine tip just wait until you get to seven thousands points before you buy anything otherwise you start again pointwise
product received for freei cant even play this there is a server error saying downloading vital data for the pass three days since sunday i tried contacting support and they wont even contact me back
after seeing a negative review of this gameeven though the majority like iti wanted to make a review talking about what a great horror game this is first of allits free i really see no reason why you shouldnt get it just to try it out karamari hospital the dlc costs just under 6but if you enjoyed the game i would recommend the dlc nowim gonna get into the main review the game itself does have a lot of referencesbut thats what makes it great the game doesnt feel like it stole these concepts from anythingthe closest it gets to other gamesmovies is slight references1if you find jump scares scary get this game2if you are unsuretry watching markiplier or someone play itthats how i found out about it just make sure you only watch a bitso that the game still has some surprises3i found i rarely died from enemiesbut that was because i was absolutely terrified of themand wouldnt get near them time to talk about the enemiesi wont say them alljust some stuff to knowpossible spoilersspecimen one the main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outsat first they arent scarybut later into the gamei began to fear them more then the actual enemies they jump scare youbut the do it all the timeand its terrifying specimen two and three chase you aroundthey arent the scariest i skipped a bit of the gameim gonna replay it all soonso i missed the specimen four and five parts they still look spooky though specimen six is well the bane of my existence specimen six is probably one of the scariest monsters in the gameas he will stalk you downand slaughter you his death screen terrified meand his area contains a lot of zelda referenceswhich i quite enjoyed justwhen you play the gamebe ready for specimen six specimen seven isnt really scary but it confuses youand makes chases with other monsters much harder specimen eight is the deer god things in his area start out fairly unscarybut then eight shows upand the terror begins although not one of the scariesthe is probably on the most memorable specimen nine randomly appears if you spend too long in a room i have never encountered him beforespoileri he reappears as the final boss of the gamewhom you battle with an axe it is funand similar to the ganon battle from loz oocspoileri specimen ten is featured in a cool futuristic area i dont entirely remember himbut i remember he is very hard to run away from specimen 11who i refer to as the beef godis one of the scariest enemies in the game i remember him from lets plays of the gameso maybe i was just nervous when i entered his area the area he is in is a fast food restaurant area there is a lot to do before meeting himbut it is very unnervingespecially since the music is terrifying specimen twelve the old man or the mansion is one massive room it takes the place of a mansionwhere you complete various tasks while running from the old man it was very funand scary specimen thirteen who i call the siren is a monster very similar to kaernk from amnesia the dark descent you must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren it was really funand the area before was very scary that raps up the review of the monstersbut i have a few more things to say1 the game doesnt have amazing graphicsbut that kinda adds to the horror2 the game has a lot of referenceswhich is one of the best parts of the game3 this game is terrifyingatleast if jumpscares scare you 3i would definitely recommend this game1010
early access reviewbased on this amount of minutes i conclude that the game is similar to robocraft but its more of a tactical game your ships move slowly and you take your time to plan where to attack the enemy the controls of this game is not hard although its quite a lot you can view guide for the controls at anytime in the game by pressing the button o and k its not only base on speed and reaction time as strategizing is taken into account you need to work as a team and you cannot solorambo style like other action pvp games
even get through the tutorial too annoying i stopped twice to apply ini edits to compensate for oh no one will ever want to do that deficiencies in the options specifically to invert the yaxis on the mouse and to make ui text large enough to actually read and then i found that the incessant auction house notifications can not be turned off nor can they be moved out of the center of the screen that was basically a dealbreaker too much hostile ui didnt even get into the combat part of the tutorial before i was annoyed right off the game and deleted it
been playing this game since it was open beta it now sucks the devs dont care about the players that have been here all these years and ninety of the time ppl cant log into it coz it keeps doing errors on sign in and crashing now you cant even make it work in safe mode if you want to get reely annoyed and angry playing a game then this is the one you wanna play otherwise stay away from this piece of cryptic crap in addition to annoying the crap out of you and crashing on login all the classes in the game are broken in sum way all the dungns are also broken and usually the last bosses glitch out or bug nd yu get nothing coz they cant be killed or yu cue and get into a bugged instance glitched out graphical errors on clothing items i e giant spike visible to all while mounted if wearing a helmut this game was a great game since mod four it has slowlyy slid down the hill thru the sewage pipes and is now a sewer monster of a game and i have serious doubts with the company that makes it as a whole since it seems i cud code the game better than they can nd i have rudimenntary knowledge of such things anyways if another company gets the game ill play it again for now its being deleted until futher notice piece of crap
game chrashed on start up five times should have taken that as a warning ran into the first jumpscare game glitched then i decided that this game would be better suited as an example of how not to make a game one thousand and ten would waste my time to start this up and have it glitch again
early access reviewthis game is free how 1010about three hundred rooms in game started of very simple just cardboard pictures of cartoonlike ghosts and skeletons eventually sht starts getting creepy things start chasing you and as research lab databases show there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go i loved the minigames a great relief from the games jump scares although i think jump scares are cheap and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a horror games fnaf this game uses them effectively creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cutouts while being chased by a headeating resident evillike monster this game has a strange effect as i want to continue on just one room more i tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor which i nervously walk down or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight worth the zero i invested and im looking forward to the one thousandth room if i ever get there gameplay 810helpless at the start and so far still like that controls are simple but work effectively graphics 910simple cartoons at start but develops to much darker images polish 810funny spooky girl detailed backlog of each monster and fear what more to ask for
by far the best ccg on the market right now the game is extremely generous to f2p players if you expect to have a full collection of cards within a week of playing a free game then maybe this game is not for you gameplay is very well thought out in both balance and mechanics i highly recommend at least trying this game if you have enjoyed other ccgs in the past or if you would like to see what the genre is all about
the worst thing about this game are the prices for the more indepth cockpits but most likely if you spend that much on them in the first place it will be very worth it dcs is nothing short of amazing it feels awesome to fly the planes the learning curve is there but after a few days its all down and good the planes have weight to them and even the simplest of maneuvers and procedures cant be done by just jumping in and acting like you know what youre doing if you arent an experienced pilot no worries you can start with circling airfields and landing at others move onto some strafing runs go to bombings sead and by then youll probably have purchased fc3 speaking of fc3 researching the expansion will likely tell you that you need the others which isnt true anymore its an awesome expansion for learning to fly fc3 is basically the bridge between the su25 and aircraft like the a10c its a great game and its free to start off if you like aircraft whether it be fsx arma il2 or any other simulator you will like this gamealso even though the photos show the su24 and some other planes you cannot fly any planes that arent a the su25t or b listed in a dlc
early access reviewi could play this game for hours just snowboarding down mountains throw in the fact that it feels less sluggish better optimized and faster paced than pubg well im sold my only major gripe is that at longer ranges in which a sniper should still be effective you will see players stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion this makes longer range battles a headache when this occurs if they can polish this up i will be one hundred satisfied with this game the hours of fun its brought me so far has reignited my love for this genre and opened my eyes to the mediocrity weve settled with for far too long rip pubg
creativerse is yet another sandbox game want a description personal description it is basically like the minecraft game but with smoother graphics more advanced technologies and much larger content if you have played minecraft you will really like this gamei recommend you guys to try it since its free
this game is a very good combat simulator but theres only one thing i dont like there are only bad planes that are default there should be more advanced and more manuevrable planes as default
the devs just keep delivering such great content for this free to play game other than its grindy nature well the devs are called ggg d i dont find another reason why this shouldnt be the best arpg of all time out there it takes some getting used to for new players true but once you do get into it it is hard to leave it aside for too long and while my gaming backlog keeps increasing i cant help but get back to this game every single league
dlc the gameyou can drive one car on one track and watch replays of it fifteen times over again for free and nothing else if you love paying for a game more than once its pretty swell the ui is kewl looking tho one hundred and ten
as a long time minecrafter i kinda think of this as its slightly fancier more challenging cousin lol the basic concept of grab blocksplace blocks applies daynight cycle of yay and sheer terror appliesthough some of the monsters in this game far surpass minecraft in fear factor the crafting though is a hyper improved system of craft this and oh look you can now make this kinda pushing you to upgrade and find new types of blocks the biomes also feel simply more appropriate in creativerseoften seeing similar creatures but ones fitting for that zone in color or style i enjoy both but i will say this is freethe pro version may be an option someday for the cosmetics but if your looking for a funthinkersbuilding game thats free look no further also side note ill be starting a creativerse series on my youtube channel soonso theres that xdas a side note true sucking up blocks into a glove is crazy but hey so is nearly unlimited storage with no weight hinderance but all games have it
early access reviewthis game is outstanding basically its a free version of super smash bros i recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a indie action fighting game i play this game every day this game is amazing one of the best platformers for low spec pcs
been playing this game for a long time now but since the begining its been horrible and gotten worse since when in the real world can grenade toting enemy take out tanks with a couple grenades its rediculouse even for free its horrible uninstalling
a truly fun and addictive f2p game with stunning graphics and tight controls dont need to pay to have fun even if you dont enjoy or have played flying games i would highly reccomend this
the most interesting scheme it has that it starts like a childs spook park but later it changes to adult to reality i would recommend the game it has a decent scare style from calm to insanity boo
most hours spent in my gaming life there isnt supposed to have a storyline however each character has its unique personality and is very lovable ref valves video clips those characters are not just for visual graphics each toon has a soul and you can feel it in the game simply best game ever and it doesnt get old
i love this game even though this game practicaly costs â one hundred you stil get a great game for not paying the dlc i have lots of fun playing it also how is this a adventure a shooter and fps
early access reviewwas a fan of day of defeat and i was looking forward to this allies vs axis fps started with semi auto rifle with the germans and looking forward to get a kar or k98 which was my favourite in dod rank one to rank3 quite alright rank3 to rank4 oh like 6hours to get it and now rank four to rank5 which will be double the time i gave up so sick of the same weapon
this game is complete and utter garbage i cant for the life of me figure out how people enjoy games that have a useless control sceme that is difficult to change because for what ever reason the game develpoers decide to make the menus confusing to the point that its hard to find what you are looking to change ti should also be noted that it is another free to play game that goes by its stereotype it isnt easy to play unless you spend well over an hour to even attempt to understand what to do i wish that for once i can find an actually well made game for free that isnt riddled with microtransations
ʖ
early access reviewi can honestly say that this game has become complete and utter if you join any match beyond the matches that have everyone using the staring three bots all you will find is helicopters with three blocks and an ultra op weapon and teslas with an invisibility module this isnt just from salt from dying to tesla stars even though i have its because its so easy to build a tesla that everyone does it and then goes around instakilling eachother which is sooooo boring baically as every other player that played when there was still tech points and not even battle arena mode i wouldnt play this game unless you love to spend hours making a bot o watch it be destroyed in two seconds by a tesla that took someone five minutes
update fifty five is very sad it like you go over to someone house and bend there daughter over and began to give and that what update fifty five us doing bend the player over and give them
the game is awesome i love it but but butupdate ok i do not recomment the game under the explained circumstances but i keep playing the game because i solved the computer behavior i could one hundred predict the computers behavior but its not very easy i spend a whole night to understand the why and found ten rules you can predict the computer and by that i mean cards drwan by the oponent and yourself i made some recodings to prove a one hundred prediction chance of what will happen but the system has two flaws first i was psychotic at this time that means iam able to extremly focus without effort two flaw is there is a particular playstyle wich creates so many possibilities that its at least for me impossible so calculate all resulutions if you want to know about how the computer works and want a detailed explonation whats happening whyle playing then send me feedback if enough people show interest i create youtube videos with commented gameplay and turn prediction why the computer akt like that and what fails lead to a lost match also i create a list of tips to help understand the computer behavior and rules to rise chances to win basically you never play against human its all about understanding the computers move send me a message show interest and i share my information and hope to develop better playstyles and raise winrate tahnk you just to mention it iam not atvertising iam no utuber iam no streamer i dont write frourm stuff iam just a guy plaing games and is angry about todays player rip of t to make cash legends this pay to win lets solve this and break there system the system short list of pro and contra proart game feels artificialy manipulatedthe game is build around paying money or live with frustrating timeconsuming grind the deck is is controled by the computer and not by the universe like in real so i assume we are not talking about real coincidence withour money just very little reward and not balanced between time spend and rewards claimed paying money will defenitly create that balance long version and in deph explanation of my experience it is very unsatisfying that the game is not kontrolled by the universe instead controled by a computer wich is programed in a way that the actual game feels unnatural in every match and every round you just get the right card for the last minute rescue or a turn around last minute victory in every single match either me or the oponent get just the right ing card for the most obvious game changing resolution problem is i cant prove it but my guts telling me that the computer is not mixing the deck once in the beginning the computer rather calculate and analyse your behavuior and moves to keep the win chances for both players fifty until its not possible to correct the player made false decisions its awefuli assume but i cant prove it that with so much control from a computer maybe the chances to win for a paying customer are higher then for a non pying customer and i dont mean the unfair advantages from the cards what i mean is that the win chances may be higher for payers so they are more satisfyed for there insvestment and keep paying while the not yet paying customer put into artificial frustration to force the non payer to pay real money to keep fit for the competition lets be honest this came is a casino a lotteri a sot mashine its gambling and what happens if the house play by the rules of the universe right the bank is balanced because winning and losing is after one million tries at fifty but that way u cant make money so you have to control the situation just enough so the payer dont feel riped off but the bank stil makes money it is aweful how obvious the game is completly build around the real money shop no doubt if i werent such a pain loving mashine who loves frustration in a weird way i would have payed real money yet what i did not have so be warned the game knows exactly how to get your money esespecially if your not so damn stubborn like me example i played last night seven hours i won three games out of twelve since i hit level twenty one the difficulti changed big step before that i had a win rate for like ten hours at around fifty right now a intense match against a human player 1v1 will take around two thousand and thirty minutes you need three win to get a reward of fifteen gold and one random card you get xp for losing and winning per level upgrade wich gives u usually a pack of six random cards and gold i think in between you get card upgrades for special cards together for me it feels very unrewarding i can tell you compared to the campain act one its like chiling on the beach or strugling trouth an orcan the campian against ai was so awesome satisfying and felt like it should feel but right after the free experience and even the first arena against ai and even the first matches against players you get a big ing sign to pay pay pay for me it felt like whoa wht the hell whats that mountain doning here suddenly the thing is the full campain cost extra money but act one was very cool for a card game also the arena a second time was so impossible hard with the same deck i played the first one that i did not even win a single match and wasted one hundred and fifty gold for one hundred and fifty gold you need 10x3 won thirty played games with one hundred win rate a two thousand and thirty minutes wich make three hundred minutes or five hours in a perfect world also after leveling up form one hundred and twenty four iam right now i felt like the matchmaking put mit into realy hardcore fights in my opinions just to show me what paying real money can do in this game the game takes care that you dont win all the time and it rembers you very direct when a guy plays a five time combo chain in round four an win two rounds later i mean yeah skill and experience is stil important and i am aware that my wrong decisions lead to lost matches and yes iam quite aware that i just try to find a explonation for losing more often then winning so i maybe wrong but since i cant prove manny asumptions all i have is my
early access reviewyeah in the past few months the updates have been dramatically ruining the game used to be much better personally attempted to contact reto and got bannedyeah please dont waste your money on this pile ofâ â â â â â
plenty of nasty comments about a free to play game not actually being free duhdoy free game comes with one rifle one shotgun and the ability to travel almost everywhere and hunt five species every week i got here via thehunter call of the wild which is also a game i did not see myself play but i really like the game forcing me the change in the regular pace of gaming that i do i see this game as its older uglier but still able brother it comes with a subscription based model or licenses to hunt specific species then if you like it as much you can chose to buff up your armoury looks etc w more digital goods yes confusing but a luxoury the game itself is an interesting one its free to try and of this day i have not spend a penny on it yet but considering
sooooo80 hours on this game and i still havent grown tired of it really cool game to play with friends well without counting all the pros that there are in this game deleting the beginner servers was a big mistake by the devs but eh not a big deal graphics are meh but thats not what im going to be focused on the strategy on this game is incredible learning to control a city and paths are really a pain in the to learn but its great it gives the game a new whole dificulty to explore the farming aint that bad i would say it is the most relaxing thing of this game tbh without counting the mega zombies those have scared me a couple times xp normal zombies those es they arent even dificult to kill they are just annoying they should be at least a little bit more dificult to kill one headshot or two hits from a katana could be more challenging cars rip they can only be used in private servers unlucky af at least if you find a spawned one u can ride it around tho d its allways nice not having to pay fifty thousand moneys to go to a city from a farm spot the jump spam just one thing to say u will get used to it the fights bettween teams are allways a great way to rob some stuff if ya know what i mean wink wink really fun and relaxing to play recommend one hundred to play it with friends dont play alone ur just going to get butt ed every time u enter the game cuz the hackeehem mother ing pros that dont have a life i guess will just quickscope headshot u on sight but aaaaayyyy srsly go away from this game dont enter this game unless ur sadistic like me or rly like challenges like me anyways for who installs this game good luck in this hell land bruddas
"twenty million, one hundred and forty two thousand and sixteen review this game started out as a beautiful creation this game was an absolutely unique style with its own cartoony graphics followed behind the most best ways of presenting the entire nine man team and their personalitys however sense the gunmettle update this game has slowly started to slip from its former glory this game started to try and copy cs go which ruins what was once so unique about it this game used to be a game that was a different experience all on its own it was a team experience that honeslty brought a smile to anyones face from joining their first pub server to leaving their last this game used to be so unique it would pull different players in from everywhere now its trying its best to stay afloat when everyone can clearly see the game is dwindling from its former glory dont get me wrong i love team fortress two however this game has run out of update ideas it hurts to see that the updates are pay to join and have become pay to get a crate to just pay for a key for that crate unboxing used to be a optional thing and it still is but its being pressured to unbox more and more by valve with every single update i have had my fair share of the whole experience in this game and this review is coming from someone who has seen it all i have seen the trader experience and the player experience this game offers i have crossed the battlefield of mvm i have run across the pubs i have joined every update and i can conclude that this game is losing its spunk http steamcommunity have had a couple ideas for updates ie maybe medic makes some sort of mistake and one of the characters get to become female i know many of you agree most likely female characters would be a huge change in this game that would make both an interesing sfm and an interesting update it would be one that is completely free for the team fortress two community and it would be one that allows a female player to become a female character regardless this is my opinion on it i have watched friend after friend cash out on this game and slowly walk away from the memories they made with every step it is your choice to play or not to play what role you take is all your own decision here are a couple videos of my playthroughs to see if you still want to play or not to play https www youtube comwatch virzcvgtewqhttps www youtube comwatch v9nazaxpjjcy"
free good time waster no need to log every day to collect a silly bonus or to keep your dwellers alive like in the usual facebook games however it really needs to option to save your game on cloud i played it before on phone then i moved to bethesda net losing all progress i manage to trasnfer my progress after i migrate to steam but if anything will happen with my hdd i may lose it forever
early access reviewwow this is unreal and i mean it the hit box and all it something to laugh at and then on top of that all the patchs the lil kids cry about and all get done and then dont get started on the hackers so many videos out there showing the hacking and all is so unreal and nothing is getting done about it like after one or two days after a patch there was a video with new hacks like they need to get something about that like hunt down the sites and find out who is all doing it unlike fortnite there suing the hackers not the makers and even ppl that show that there not doing anything about the hacker and show it still works and all just like this game they dont care they want hackers to ban and get them to buy more of the game like pubg bc that means more money and not to stop the hacker means less money for them this right now is sofar out of ten games i have seen four speeders and four to five aimbot more then half way accross the map like update the anticheats every other day this will for sure stops more then eighty of them and ban them for good
the game is designed and ran in such as way as to separate you from as much money as possible decks are being powercrept out of the game practically every month with a slightly more efficient otk build being released in every new box near enough every game is decided with a combination of rock paper scissors and a coin flip are you playing the latest meta deck or a specific counter if yes flip a coin if tails you go second and otk them for the win if heads you go first watch your board get wiped and otkd there is very little interactivity in the game beyond this at the moment as a new player you will get enough new gems to pick up the cards you need for the latest otk deck after this you might even earn enough gems for the next latest but sooner rather than later youll find your supply of currency drying up and any sort of vaguely competetive pvp will become impossible and you are absoloutely screwed if you want to build any of the older archetypes that are often spread accross three or four boxes at this point you will either quit the game or become a whale throwing money at it until you suddenly realise just how much fun you could have been having spending that money on something else if you have the disposable income or are strongwilled enough to grind completely free to play and dont intend to enguage in serious pvp matches you might find some enjoyment otherwise i would highly recommend avoiding especially if you lack self control when it comes to freemium
"early access reviewi no i only have one h of the game but for now i cant recommend this game i no it is early accessbut games feels soooo empty boring world it i so quiet like it has no purpose very little items you have here of all battle royale game i think this one is the most empty the only like biggest thing here is types of weapons and even that there are not that many most weapons are boring and useless no one even use most of them many are still not optimised feels wrong when shooting upgrades on guns means and feel almost nothing with or without almost the same thing after the new game update game feels even more realistic in wrong whey it doesnt matter what you have on yo die in twenty three bullets all those equipment now means nothing in the game really with ot without you die in twenty three bullets the worst thing here is optimizations and ppl are so tired of this even if the game is early aces the game look like older gen from twenty elevens twenty twelves i no i dont have high end machinebut for for this game i have whayyyyyyy more than enough requirement to play and i barely play on low 900p and three thousand, five hundred and forty five fps the game already feels dead every time i wait for player i wait for forty five min omg already many times makes me want to quit of boredom really not good i think this is just another random game that will die in couple of years it will never feel good od finished or optimised to play well and enjoy"
now this game is really addictive but it has some problems like the spawn system and game mechanics like the fact that you can t go trough a wooden fenche with a tank even with full speed air planes are kinda over powered since they are hard to kill and they can spam bombs the spawn system is annoying because of the amount of waiting you need to do is huge reasons for that are spawn deploy queue travelling to location and many others also the spawn points are simply cancer because they are so easy to spawn camp with a tank or sniper the biggest reason why idon t reccomend this game is that i like realism specially in a ww2 game and i love tankairplane combat and this game s vehicle combat is rather buggy go ahead and download this game try it the game is addictive and fun but someone like me these little problems will ruin the fun
this is yet another game that i wish steam had a neutral rating for its decent for what it is but overall its pretty meh pros a game that can be played with one hand that has hot anime style chicks moaning cons everything else i was hoping this game would be better because ya know boobs however thats about all it has to offer yes its free but even so it seems hastily put together to capitalize on the clicker game trend adding nothing new to the formula besides breasts if thats all you want then its fine but it gets boring pretty quickly other wise oh and it has dlc outfits for some reason because ya know money play it free and enjoy the jigglies and youll be ok
early access review5060 frames and unplayable i die in thirteen hits and i cant even find people why is everyone wearing black in a ing winter map think about the decisions you make roe make a community forum or something to help push decisions youre sitting on a gold mine but choose not to strike gold why are the graphics the same no matter what if your run max and low make a potato graphic for people who cant even shoot the gun last update was not great for this game

early access reviewomg this game is so bad the devs do whatever the f they want no wonder why it only has 2k players thi game had the potential to compete with other big br games too bad it was made by hirez
product received for freeearly access reviewspent so much time getting higher armored blocks forty hours then they updated only making one type of block and they didnt even give me a refund ing s next time tell us your gonna us over
all the money spent and all that time spent on this game and yet gaijin remained stubborn in its way in order to milk this game to its fullest it is unfortunate that this game is so niche that theres no real alternatives i do not recommend anyone new to start this game because youre only going to expect disappointment and anger
although it is a free to play due to how much it restricts the player unless they pay for the items and no you cant even use ingame cash the game might as well have a price to it and even then i dont think they would allwo you to unlock all items that would have been locked through a pay wall it is fun but it quickly gets boring because of how large the restrictions are at the very least allow us to use the in game money
early access reviewi try to play one game i have never played before i made an account started matchmaking and it says that i have been cheating on my pc and it baned me never played one game
eight gb for one race track is more than a little too much im guessing all the dlc is included from the start off its a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent and it has external wheel and pedal support at least its not bad but hardly great either i just have it installed because i dont have any other games that support the wheel in order for this to really be worth recommending itd need a few more tracks and much cheaper carextra track unlocks theres some bugs where you drive through obstacles and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets its a bit frustrating

early access reviewthis ing game is awful my friend recommende this game because he loved aq worlds big mistake the ign starting area is impossible my friend who is level three died to a level three frogzard and he abonded and i died six times trying to find edon notes dont download this piece we have to find thirty flying eye wings in zone that has only nine admoninations of flying eye
if they turned this into a pay to play game and instead of buying gear with cash make you work for it but not like china farmers hard lol but get better and better gear as you clear more difficult content i think this game would be huge but they way it is now its â â â â â â â â you cant even buy more inventory slots unless you pay one thousand and twenty bucks a pop thats insane when i used to play when level sixty was cap i didnt pay for much i did buy one more bag for inventory but i had my char pretty geared up with the dailys and getting all the dimond cash from refineing it it was not bad but now its stupid you can buy a whole new upgraded computer and play some other games with a 4k tv with the money you will need to spend at level seventy devs got really greedy not worth the time even though it is a good game just the pay to not even win but to get regular stuff outta hand screw these devs for doing that to a great combat and pretty deep class building dd game shame on yall
first thing you should know about planetside two is that its a game in a league of its own cause its scale is huge comparred to any other fpspros one the games bloody massivethe maps in this game are four entire continents with different climates where factions made up of thousands of players battle each other for territory this means youll see huge battles with hundreds of people at one facility and battles with as little as zero people p2 youre totaly free to do what you wantthe game is basically an organized freeroam fps with optional objectives so you can do what ever the hell you want wether its squading up into a large platoon to stratigically take over bases or simply doing your own thing around the continent alone or with a few buddies just to have fun3 its not pay to winevery single weapon or vehicle in the game can be bought with certs that are earned from getting xp even if the grind is really really long4 awesome variation of different classesthere are a bunch of different classes which give really cool perks like invisibility jet packs increased shields ect so you can play with any playstyle you likecon only thing that the game could really improve on are the buildings theyre kinda just empty rooms with a few boxes and benches and stuff
three things i love most in this world as of right now gaming vikings and dragons so why not combine all three well would you combine donuts alfredo and sushi yeah neither would i
do you like tanks do you like planes do you like ww2 games because this is one of the best free online games on steam taking place in a ww2 setting you can join the american side the russian side or the german side with your choice you are subject to diverse weapons vehicles and character personalization of that country there is an advancement system of ranks which is achieved when you gain experience from battle fight in large maps to aid your country in the war or fight in a skirmish map for practice and less experience gain heroes and generals is unique with its scenery an the maps created are greatly designed for the action that ensues i myself thoroughly enjoy this game and always come back to it again and again playing it to enjoy the thrill of my team all charging in with vehicles and on foot heroes and generals definitely deserves a better rating
good game i have been reading some reviews of this game and none of them said that you can get most of p2w item with in game currency some of them arent but you can gift them and the prices for them arent really that high you the most must buy item is skill slot b that cost aroun 70mil to to 120mil and taking into acount that you get 100mil doing all story quest up to lvl eightyfive so you will get it and once you get really late gaem you can get easily about 200mil weekly so the game isnt a hard p2w taking into acount all of this the good thing of this gamethis game is unique there isnt a lot of game like this that isnt from the same devis fun to play and there is a lot of variety of classes to choose fromwhen you find people to with the game become a lot easierthe bad things about this gamethis game is all about grindthis game is way to unbalanced you have classes that are garbage at everything they can doim looking at you cra w and others that are plently broken in everything they dolike luciel and aralagthe community is mostly edgy kids and people that do a dungeon run while they wait to their league queuethe duns are repetitive and the aimations that at the start look amazing and inmersive are annoying laterbugsdosnt have a banana weapon skinthe game dosnt even try to explian the most complex thing like socketing and enhacingthe tutorial is the most useless and annoying in this game dosnt release some content because of moneyhaving to run the same dun three and more times is boring
so as of now it wont let me create an account it just broke this is honestly it looked like a lot of fun and though it was free i just couldnt make an account it sent me to the website to create it and i did that and at first it seemed to work but then it showed an error sign then my email got verified so i cant retry this sucks
early access reviewlets get right into it why does another battle ground need to exist well lets talk about what makes this game different than its popular competitorschoose your class warrior assassin engineer mage or hunter all have special abilities weapons and passives no healer but there is some support builds that warriors and engineers can go forride a horse mount to ride through zones when outsidedisenchant obsolite items to create materials to craft legendary armor weapons abilities and potionslook for forge smoke to spot enemies who are crafting swoop in eliminate them and steal the legenday lootwhen your hp reaches zero you are polymorphed into a chicken survive as a chicken for thirty seconds and you will revive if you die as a chicken or get polymorphed three times and you are eliminated this is a simplified explaination but there is a lot more i could ramble on about but honestly you should just get in and give it a try the game is very early access and needs to be polished but plays well and the game is being updated and improved very rapidly p s its amazing how people over react to a bad patch yes this latest patch has its flaws but it solved a lot of other issues with the game most people read the patch notes and immediately freaked out most of these bad reviews come from that drama if people actually played the patch they would see that the pace of the game is a lot better and overall the game still feels like the game we all enjoyed from day one
product received for freeearly access reviewi used to love this game devs of heroes and generals if your reading this the game would be much more enjoyable if everything in the game fifty offit takes weeks just to get a lmg or a pistole so please make a change and stop makeing dumb vehicals to hide the truth
early access reviewthis game is already good in alpha cant wait to see what the ten looks like totally worth the one thousand the gameplay and rules are simple but the tactics and strats can get very complex
early access reviewwould recommend this joke battle royale game if they didnt install some game agent ive never heard of and didnt add it to my startup programs game is okay tons of clipping issues and buggy gameplay have fun climbing that ladder
early access reviewwell at first i thought it was just a pubg clone but when i played i found out its kind of more fun for me and i have pubg so there are issues like i snipe a guy with a sniper in the head and he survives but hey its a beta so its ok it have a lot of potential and i hope more people will start playing it already have all of my friends download it so give it a try guys
the game controls feels werid the game is broken practicly my screen keeps rotating clockwise my fire button stopped working it isnt really a good game as it is a finished game if it is a early access game then i would be alright im dissipointed
early access reviewto the people ing and comparing this to minecraft come on bru before talking smack at least play five hours of the game where to start well the building system is one of the best i ve ever seen the graphics is pretty good and gathering materials is easy as hell not gonna lie its a bit hard in the beggining but it gets much easier later on
hello there now ive only played this game a little i promise there are a few things that hirez could work on and ive emptied my wallet a few times all have been worth it its a great game with a great concept with them currently enchancing old skins and even remodeling people im fairly confident this games easily one of my favourites
"early access reviewthe latest update on sixty two thousand, two hundred and eighteen has ruined the game unless they revert the changes to the forge as well as the legendary weapons dropping from any crate this is not worth playing such a shame because this game was great rip"
early access reviewi really enjoy this game the matches are quick brutal and and require a lot of teamwork starting with ship selection the ships are varied with many quirky features it takes time to master each so i dont mind the grind as each one is pretty fun to play for an early access alpha its very nice way to send thousands of people to their deaths in order to capture an enemy base or some such
this game is glitchy and has terrible graphics with no story just mission after misson while you may beable to limitly cusomise your charecter and dragon it crashes and freezes even on a high end computer randomly the game also has many spots where you can glitch through the ground and walls
early access reviewi had fun until i realised that as everything cost money even reloading ammo free from crates presented a bill at the end of the battle and that my soldiers cost more than they made per battle the only way to play was with the basic rifle boring boring boring when there are planes tanks snipers on motorbikes and i was there as server filler to give them something to shoot at graphics are not great which i would have forgiven if i didnt think i was being milked for my cash avoid
very high knowledge cap required for mastery of the game you do not need to actively trade but it is highly advantagious and encouraged no auction house but there are selling threads on the main site and spinoff sites that work decently well the devs are very active in the game and produce a new expansion that consists generally of new game that require you to learn how to rise above it this happens on average every four months the game is not overly grindy to level to where the majority of people are at if you know what you are doing but is extremely grindy to get to max level the good part of that is it is not needed to be that high of a level by any stretch of the imagination there is lag that will hit you frequently more or less depending on your charplaystyle and that is a fault of the client to server communication but you can help to make it less frustrating by making a macro that types oos out of sync extremely fun to make new buildscharacters and actually encourages this behaviour the game is very challenging however it rewards you for overcoming its difficulty the only negatives i can really list is the lack of an auction house system the lag that sometimes happens and it is very recommended to purchase bank space if you want to be an active succesfull merchant but the prices on all the micro transactions are very reasonable and are not game altering ala paytowin lots of cosmetic micro transactions that are really cool if you like that kind of thing
not bad in parts but sick to death of the people that instantly kill you every single time even if you no weapons and the constant game crashing and disconnecting from servers needs sorting out i met about maybe fifty six folk that wont kill you soon as they see you the rest are just trigger happy kids that dont give a toss sort it out
"great game developer listen to its playerbase and try there best to improve the game gameplay is fun grindy farming style of game but also casual play available too overall eight thousand, five hundred and ten"
early access reviewthe first time i played this game it was alright it had the typical tech tree system youd see in some other games of the same nature but in this one you created your own fighter with its own special mechanics you had to get quite invested into a certain branch in the tech tree to get the best part from it which is good that makes sense then i sorta drew away from the game as i started playing others i came back a while later after my friend started playing and said i should redownload so i did and i played an what so now your level is linked to the parts you can buy welp im a pretty high level so this shouldnt be a problem then i repeat uninstall wait redownload what the hell so now you can buy any goddamn part you want the game seems to have transformed from a competent fun action game into this mess of microtransactions yes crates ingame currency we dont need the old fans just grab in some new players and make them buy stuff this game doesnt need anymore dedicated players who couldve spent hours trying to get a single part now you can buy that and give us more money
this game is truly surely realy freakin amazing only discovered this game a few days ago and i wish i had soonernow all thats left is to convince the friends of how good it is its real freakin goodmassive battles an unbelievable experience kinda feels like star ship trooperthe movie but without the alliens would you like to know more try it love itthis game is that good
early access reviewi was obsessed with this game really fun and spent hours playing until they changed everything fun about it now it s all about payments it s just stupid matching lvl 1s with lvl 100s so if you really want to have a chance to win you need better equipment and here come the boxes they just suck plus it is really hard to get something valuable now i am just tired of playing this nonsense they ruined it with the new eco systemif you are just starting you are going to have a bad time
early access reviewreally good game but could use maybe a ranged weapon like a bow or rifle maybe they could add magic cells like a fire one that would shoot fireballs and to make it you need lave over all great game one thousand and ten d
early access reviewi would like to state up front im no expert at this i will try my best i really like this game several walls need to be smoothed out so when you walk into them and then you climb the wall all in all its a very fun game i played the frist game in the seris a few weeks after it was released and i really enjoyed it skip forward a year and then you have the 2d mmo we all know and love and just like its first humble begaining i am sure once the game is fully finished and all the areas are added it will bring back the joy we all had when we first made our first accont only to make another because we forgot the password i rate nine hundred and ten
"played for roughly two hours the best part of this game is the character creation screen though graphic wise its pretty good looking thats where it ends for whatever reason optimization is horrible the game runs best on max settings then it does on lower settings class wise the way to level up skills and chaining them isnt really explained too well its a learn as you go type thing mounts have energy and if you run our you cannot mount till it recovers or you use an energy recovery potion side quests arent really explained what to do especially the gather ones where it doesnt even tell you where to gather the items at i hit level eleven within those two hours and was on a main mission quest where you had to kill a level one elite ghoul it will one shot you dealing one thousand, four hundred damgae to you which is unavoidable if youre melee balance wise the game is a giant joke you can one shot certain mobs and in return get one shot by mobs you must kill to progress the story mission quests i also ran into a bug where by dying to that level eleven ghoul and selecting to spawn at the ghost instead of having to spend gems to respawn right where i was i would fall through the world over and over again unless i was able to time running the instant my characters ghost touched the ground all in all its a sorry excuse for a game i understand personally now why it has failed in every region it has ever come out in on my honest opinion as someone whos been playing mmos since two thousand and two dont bother with this one let it die alone in a corner and go to something else its not worth the time"
early access reviewearly access reviewpros free two playnot a pay2win gamehope it will stay like thatskill based fighting mechanics decent amount of content so yaydevelopers who actually care about their game many devs nowadays just release the game and not care about itcons servers can be laggy sometimes since europa server was added it lagg lessthe community is relatively small ppl rly need to play dis
"there seem to be a lot of negative reviews related to this games free to play model most people seem to label it as pay to play which is and isnt true to get full use fo the game at all times you do have to have a subscription membership however there are several animals you can hunt at all time regardless of the subscription and there are rotating weekly animals that you also gain access to again to get the full experience you will need to spend some real money but if youre just looking for a well built hunting sim to spend a couple hours a week hunting whitetails you dont need to spend a penny and thats definitely a win in my books i will list the subscription options below duration cost three months nine hundred and ninety nine usd six months one thousand, eight hundred and ninety nine usd twelve months three thousand, four hundred and ninety nine usd so for only thirty five you get a full year of full access they also offer starter bundles for fifty you get a twelve month membership and all that entitles you to as well as nine weapons and thirtyfive items these are permanant unlocks and will remain available even if your subscription expires"
early access reviewtherere better mmorpg games out there that works better than this graphics npc movements skill display hope this game gets developed a s a p or down the drain it goes flush wash hands with soap i wont recommend you buying it now tho
trove is a pretty fun game until you get to the later levels where it becomes a complete grind fest theres very little actual gameplay content in the game basically the game consists of farming dungeons mining and farming biomes for crafting resources theres plenty of to unlock but most of the things you unlock dont really feel all that special for example the mounts in this game all have the same stats so theres no point to getting more of them the endgame in this game is nonexistent consisting of shadow arenas and the sky realm both which are still just places to grind its fun for a couple hours so thats why i reccommended it people say its addicting and for the first one thousand and twenty hours its fun but the constant grinding becomes repetitive and boring after a while in short if you like grinding get this game if you dont try this game out anyways its free also dont be fooled by the 200mb download you still need to download about 600mb through glyph trion worlds own launcher its garbage but its not a dealbreaker
died many times made many characters they died as well this game requires a lot of time they say that dies too in this game many may find this as a pay to win game i find many ways to have fun in killing myself
early access reviewto anyone considering this game sorry but you missed the window of when it was good ultimately the point of a game is to have fun and right now it is not fun it used to be fun to build fun to play even sometimes fun to lose however the last half year have been stripping this away and now after the past couple of months it is no longer fun even to win a game when winning losing and building are all a chore and not fun it is a sign that the game has failed in the very mission i have been playing this game for over one thousands hours counting the stand alone launcher i started back when it first went on steam and although i wish i could give it a good review at this point i simply cant the developers had a fantastic game that needed a few tweaks a little balancing and some bug fixes but was otherwise really good then starting around november twenty fifteens they began doing major updates that completely broke multiple aspects of the game these updates came about more and more often worst of all they completely changed the direction that the game had been going thus veterans such as myself who fell in love with game x and were excitedly waiting its finished product instead now have game y and dread its completion i tried to keep playing but they just keep making it more difficult to stick with it everything feels gimmicky and very much like a smartphone app game balance is worse than ever and long time elements of the game were broken ultimately it feels like the game is intending to drive away veteran players in favor of casuals very sad to say but at this point i shall no longer be playing except to test periodically and see if the game has been fixed to the greatness where it once was barring that i just cant seem to bring myself to even finish a round
"early access reviewi really wish i could recommend this game i really do but i just cant there are so many flaws in this game that just leads me to a no the gameplay in this is actually pretty fun its not your typical cod game where youre a one man army unless you are a pay to winner which is a different story there are multiple branches of the militaries each with their own unique vehicles and weapons same goes with the three factions united states germany and the soviet union but it just takes so damn long to level up its a pain all of these branches have a rank requirement fyi it took me a while to get to level four making around four hundred thousand, six hundred of a score each round i like a good challenge personally but it takes such a long time to level up once you get there each weapon has its own different stats weight space it takes up damage etc one weapon might look like it sucks and it might but its all dependant on how you use them some weapons might also oneshot you its annoying even when you know you were at full health but a headshot almost always oneshots i dont know what else is happening if it was in the torso its annoying as hell honestly and some weapons need to be balanced pay to winning is a constant annoyance yes the game is free and the developers need to make money i understand that i even bought some gold to support the developers when i thought this game was good at the time they are hard at work and do deserve it but the p2w is just horrible you couldve just unlocked the tank crew class and if you had enough gold you could immediatly cheat your way to get the most powerful tank in the game the quality in this game is meh the graphics are pretty good for what it is it isnt a toptier graphical game which i personally like as it doenst take as much memory and doesnt ruin your fps the gun sound quality though i hate it it sounds like youre firing a paint ball gun and nothing real at all i dont care for this but it makes me feel like this is something the developers neglected overall five hundred and ten this game needs work it has its ups and downs if there was a sideways button labeled meh i wouldve chosen it but this isnt the game for you if youre not a patient person or could easily rage play it if you want but you will run into some problems"
early access reviewlooks pretty terrible gunplay another pubg clone trying to grab the battleroyale spotlightseriously same fonts as pubg the games pretty and was fun for a while its just who sees the other person first wins
early access reviewits like blackshot except theres less hackers and more fun and not pay to win itll be great if theres more weapon tho and even better if they decide to add dm knifes only mode oh and pls pls for the love of god show the damage that is given sometimes it took me like fkin ten bullets to kill a guy its okay that i died in the game i can accept that what i cant accept however is knowing that you nailed fkin eight hundred and ten bullets to the enemy face and they dont die at least knowing the dmg gives kinda closure
the game is fun and all but once you start playing ranked 1v1 or 2v2 its just t its not more fun its just rage after rage and no matter what you do you will always get matched with people that are better than you and then you just feel nothing more than rage i do not recommend that game even thought i have nearly three hundred hours on it its no more fun its all rage
it is a nice sims type game adapted to the fallout series it requires a different attention than normal pc games as this was designed for mobile i will keep it windowed from time to time while im watching other stuffs in my pc even though it is free it has their microtransactions to play it faster and easier i spent the five starter pack and it was worth it get you faster to the optimal game but it cames less challenging sooner
it came outcow cowcowcow
the key feature that absolutely saves this game is autoplay without that your semipointless duel grinding would be more obvious thanks to the autoplay system you can forgive the lackluster card pulls and rewards the game gives you overall this is going to be a very giveandtake yugioh game being ftp some of the latest cards are going to be here but then many cards will never be here for balance reasons even the basic essentials are missing luckily because of this you cant really pull anything good with ingame currency or real currency the urgency to spend real cash is lowered and since the console versions are rare now a days you just gotta swallow that hard pill and play if you wanna duel this is your latest most update yugioh game love it or hate it six hundred and ten
early access reviewpubg desync mess looting is time consuming and get a car or rip fortnite building shooting was not the br experience i was looking for realm royale simple but with unique twists shooting feels accurate im enjoying it910 would recommend
how to play this game to chill and have fun with no stress at all pick good company you enjoy being with select hardest ai available make sure it is not against humanes select servers to play as far away from russians as humanely possible dont kill your own men in the back while they fight have a glass of orange or apple juice and pizza with your game ddont forget to commend your tryhard carry and your supports after games if done the right way you dont have stress and this game can be actually quite fun and very very enjoyable
when i first started playing it was a great game one of the best pvp games out there if not the best now you either are targets for the pay people or you end up doing coop so chose is do i want to be a target for people or do i want to be a target for the computer either way it is frustrating to say the least i keep coming back hoping for more balance but it just keeps getting worse next step delete bye
early access reviewbetter than pubg better optimized runs without crashing no network lag etc smooth game play mechanics its my favorite battle royale not really into the latest update so much other than some of the improved graphics i hope tencent reads through the reviews and learns what the community likesdislikes about the game and makes changes accordingly
to say i have played a lot of this game would be an understatement to say this is a great game is an overstatement this game will gobble up hours of your life and spit out fury and frustration get this game
good game for people who like the locked on attacks and almost no dodge mechanic has a good story but it is wanting for some important quests instead of many mini quests game can get boring because of the time it takes to level up when you get above lvl twenty five pvp is ok but is super boring fighting normal enemies makes my adrenaline pump mor than pvp all the classes seem to be balanced but in pvp the ranger plays hide and go seek this game is fun for those who like a bit of grind and large thirteen v one boss battles totaly recommend this game
clicking simulator yes bad not if you like that sort of thing sakura clicker is a game about clicking on women some of whom are dressed to look like certain animals until they drop gold would this be a ripoff if it cost money yes does it cost money no but you can buy outfits for seventynine pence gbp each to make your character more scantily dressed its definitely enjoyable if you like this sort of thing my question though is why buy the auto clickers some of the fun of this game at least for me is cough admiring my adverseries before defeating them cant do that if your auto clickers oneshot them now can you verdict 610could probably have more features but for what it costs nothing id say its pretty good
is more a simulation than anything else except to put in time to learn it on your own and read the manuals there is a lot you can learn to do in every plane if you know how also think of the free version as a free trial and each dlc plane a squeal game each one adds as much content as its own games through the many systems and weapons and missions you could now do
feel like im cheating using the steam vers of this game so im going to play this how it is ment to be played and that is by smartphone those who play blitz on steam and the windows ten vers are just making a poor excuse by playing this version against people who are at a severe handicap i say remove this from steam and get rid of the pc user base off the mobile vers all together there is a pc version of this game and it is ment to be played on pc not this the only reason for this to be on here is to encurage the pay to win aspect that is not present in the pc version and increase their profit gains not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these things but its not right to mix mobile with a pc user base hince my digusting sixty three win rate at almost two thousands games on this new account alone and a fifty three winrate on mobile
very addictive game many options to develop your vault the small downside i experience is that it takes quite some time to make some money with money you can develop your rooms you will get there eventually but youll need to play for a while i really like the game play and the detail of the characters and rooms i would definitely recommend this game
early access reviewblack squad is a neat arcade multiplayer fps featuring familiar gameplay to cs go heres a summary positivesgreat variety of original weapons to choose from all around the world from the rare american sr47 to the famous chinese qbz97 rifle very decent graphicsthrilling and fastpaced gameplayits free negativespoor optimization performance issues are frequently reported in the forumsawkwardly designed maps with obvious chokepoints and repetitive gameplaymany of the weapons are paid dlcssporadic balancing issues such as onesided maps and overpowered weapons overall the game is a damn blast when youre winning and offers a great cheap alternative to cs go especially for our fellow bankrupt comrades who cant afford it its a neat f2p game thats guaranteed to bring you at least three minutes of fun so why not
if torchlight ii is what diablo three should have been then path of exile is what titans quest ii would have been a fresh storyline an open ended skill system and a sphere grid passive skill web that would make ffx blush make for excellent character customization opprotunities
early access reviewvery solid game for a free to play does have in game transactions but they are not really needed to have a good experience highly recommend to people who like the feel of csgobattlefield very good game
trove is mixed for me but i stilll love to plau it when i am bored when u start off u are given eight classes chosses i believe it is very fun at the start when u got your first class but also pretty boring for exmaple i know there are event days but levling up is pretty boring i do recommend this game even tho its boring to start off with it get much more fun when u are leveled up challange yourself and getting better items have fun with is gamep s if u are looking for help and u want to play with me just send me a message on steam and yeah gl
product received for freegreat alternative style moba far from a lol or dota clone and amazing to boot one of the only games you get the satisfaction of commanding ships sometimes over a km long very heavily team based as most mobas are communication is key if youre a space and moba fan this is your thing id like to add this is probably the most underrated game on steam the devs give away so much cool stuff for free inc skins game modes maps and ships community is only slighty salty too
neverwinter is one of the very few mmos that i am actually willing to play not being a big fan of the genre but being a big fan of dd i quite enjoy the game the controls are simple enough to get use to and you have a good range of classes if you play for free getting things in game can be pretty expensive but its not something you have to worry about the game is perfectly playable without the ingame purchases
product received for freeearly access reviewwekcome to super smash bros umm i ment to say is brawhallala sorry i got confused any way great game ssb but for the pc also like how you can use a controller to if you dont like key and mouse any way great game overall
"it takes about one thousand, five hundred and twenty fps if your pc has two hundred and ninety two ghz ram but its pretty cool when you play it for me its like mmo game minecraft and cube stuff but with more cool things like classes my fav is gunslinger"
early access reviewlove this game bought the season pass because i like it so much recommend to anyone who likes any of the battle royale games your really not going to be disappointed
early access reviewits hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played eversooften they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made and that these teambased rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times as every time i upgraded my parts i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted and flight is just as bad there is no way in hell as a beginner class are you going to be able to fly decently in this game especially after the most recent patches i last saw the games devs have basically ed with the game so much that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it which was two years ago it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with in other words if it isnt broken dont fix it and its surprisingly still in early access i still dont understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot whether on wheels feet or in the air the creativity part of this game is what makes it good the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are which in order to get any more of these things you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs how much you actually get per round
its a great game but it is a very difficult its not a game you can jsut pick up and play it may take hours to learn how to fly some of the jets but it is such a great feeling after you have taken out an enemy jet
as someone who always needs an idea and never knows how to get started when i do get one im a fan of the blueprint system in this game i like the challenge of gathering the materials for the build and the customizability of the blocks in the blueprint doesnt limit my creativity the abundace of recipes and blocks make it so you wont grow easily bored when youre working on a build or focused on terraforming the perfect spot for a build its really easy to get sucked into the game personally i have a tendency to wander so the map and are great for when i lacking any sense of direction inevitably get lost ive scattered projects across many biomes and i still havent fully discovered the world in which im currently playing creativerse is a great game to play alone or if youve got em with friends i started this game while it was in its early access stages and its been great to see how much its grown since then that said however i do wish they would add more content to bring my friends back into the game as i know they dont like that theres not much to do or see in the game lately theres a lot more they could do with it and i hope to see it soon
i have played tf2 for four years this update is the worst everwhy valve didnt answer expectation i liked tf2 i was sad im sad valve i put a cucumber in the your a s s
early access reviewrequires alot of teamwork still needs abit of work its worth ten bucks even though within the next year or so it shall be free to play the only thing i think it needs is an explanation of the different weapons and upgrades for the ships
so far i like it also its a freaking f2p you people about everything because you have it good edit i quit playing for simple reason its way to addictive i still think its good game but i became bit obsessive with it lol
"so i played this game back when you paid for it once and then played it was good the environment wasnt complex but it had enough in it to make ship positioning interesting and strategically relevant there were just a handful of ships to choose from and they were distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally the community of players was pretty fun to play with too now the game is free but actually not the current total cost of all dlc is seventeen thousand, nine hundred and ninety six the game is not good jumping from one tiny box to another makes everything feel cramped and more congested than before flying now feels like driving in los angeles ship positioning is mostly irrelevant because there are very few long sight lines left the ship design has gotten lazy and its hard to tell one conglomeration of plates and girders from another anymore and the player community well read the other negative reviews most of which are well thought out and written by experienced players and then read the comments on them the people who attack the writers of those reviews personally instead of reading and responding to the criticism thats the current player base its like playing with all the people you know and love from youtube comments the recent updates are a pretty naked cash grab and dont make the gameplay better than it was pay to win and lootboxes this sort of thing is so disgusting it should result in developers being ostracized by the game community at large ea would probably give you a medal though maybe if youre hurting for money you could sell out to them im sure you all would get along famously"
early access revieweasilly the best digital ccg ive played not only does it have a deep and complex card system it also has a slick and responsive interface its like taking hearthstone and making it almost as complex as mtg so you have the easy to use interface of hearthstone but all the fun card interactions of a more complex ccg also they are extremely generous with cards hearthstone has a rate of one cardper30minutes spent roughly im estimating between gold gain and dailies eternal has a rate of one cardper5minutes spent once you get past the early game card bonanza and the packs are much larger so even the cash shop prices are twelve to 14th as expensive per card on top of that buying any amount from the cash shop guarantees you three packs of cards for every expansion they release in the future including three packs immediately
early access revieweh with the game being in early access i pretty much expected bugsetc dont get me wrong i do enjoy this gamebut this game needs quite a bit of improvement first offwe need better servers or at least be able to see what the ping on the server isim annoyed with entering in to a server and it lagging quite hard on me time to time and going back to smoothetc what ever you dodont aim down your sights i experimented with it and when i was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building so you might as well just shoot from the hip if you get shot in the head with any gun pretty muchyoull fall over dead every timeso if you run across a hacker aimbotter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill thembesides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in itthough on the bright sideat least it isnt p2w and you get a large variety of gunsbut you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you wantas my personal favourite is the asval so despite the lag and spawn kill elementthe game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future so i guess i can recomend iti atleast had a lil bit of fun on the game
early access revieweternal is an excellent f2pfriendly digitial card game with engaging gameplay deeply flexible deckbuilding mechanics and a diversity of game modes pve and pvp versions of both draft and constructed play i cant recommend it enough if your a fan of ccgs and doubly so if youre looking for a more strategic alternative to games like hearthstone my background i played hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale metas i moved onto duelyst and found i enjoyed the more complex boardbased gameplay but recent expansions have promoted flashy swingy games with increasing amounts of rng i also tried other popular alternative ccgs such as shadowverse and elder scrolls legends neither hooked me eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes feel like grinding gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the ai for decent continuous rewards ladder shows greater diversity than games like hearthstone owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations draft is excellent featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards its an awesome way to build your collection as you get to keep the cards you draft this allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection especially as youre starting out while the diversity of game modes is what drew me in the rich gameplay is what has really hooked me mechanics such as echo when an echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand relic weapons hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically defenderprescribed blocking and fast spells spells that can be played in response to an opponents actions including on their turn make for some deep strategic and interactive gameplay that is much more rewarding than the backandforth nature of hearthstone the cardbased power mechanics reminiscent of magics lands makes deck building very flexible and multifaceted threefaction decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck at the same time monofaction decks are quite valiable with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire eternals meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than hearthstones team five but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned ccgs ive played the game is intensely f2p friendly in addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises packs provide twelve cards eight common three uncommon equivalent to a rare in hearthstone or duelyst and one rare epic or legendary goldlevel chests award packs and draft and forge draft versus the ai also award chests at a runs completion all this is to say regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection ive enjoyed eternal tremendously for its rich gameplay its hard to believe the game is still in beta future features like inclient tournament modes and best out of three play will only further round out this already stellar game if youre a fan of card games especially deeper ones i cant recommend eternal strongly enough
early access reviewas a person with almost one thousands hours played i can tell this is a very nice game to play at a competitive level it can look like a smash copy but in fact it is a very different game its mechanics are so well done and you always have something new to learn this game should be more valorated
early access reviewrun very smoothly not like that battle royale game coughno parachute land with superhero landing styledifferent classes different skill and buffmount so u dont have to walk all the time to get to the circlei hope some of the animation got updated later when the game is full releasedim looking forward for this game keep up the good work
first off it doesnt load into full screen thats a huge let down not only that the controls feel very restricted the fighting system is virtually nonexistent and the story feels like a rip off from tera or bdo
tato hra je taková levná napodobenina dayz a dalších survival zombie her ale když jsem tuto hru zapnul tak mě to ani nepustilo na servery sice nevim jak je to teď ale já z mých zkušeností tuto hru nedoporučuji310
this game is alright and all but it seriously lacks some major points in a mmorpg the karaoke content is too low and i cant even jam out to my favorite 80s songs while slaying orcs please improve this game accordingly
its very fun if you know what youre doing i accidently didnt bring anything to heal my best dwellers when they went on a quest and they all died which made me quit it is fun for someone who has experience with it though
its a rather fun game but it could really use a much larger playerbase much of the battles you fight are meant to be on a grand scale but they dont turn out too grand when there are only two people on each side
product received for freeearly access reviewi remember when i played this game for the first time i thought it was cool that it had these new concepts that i learned thanks to my friend but this new update ruined all of that i was excited to get back into robocraft after at least a year of not playing it due to little mention from my friend but when i heard how sad and angry he was i new that the game me and him loved was gone i played the update for fifteen minutes and i already knew it wasnt the same at all and the fact that they probably dont listen to us makes it even worse id rate this game up if it were back to the good old times and sure i sucked at the game but my friend was great at it he spent maybe one hundred dollars on the game and now all e gets is crap please please if you are reading this if the creators are reading this fix this game thank you
early access reviewsorry but i cant tolerate card game that utilize powerenergy cards you lose too many games from either not getting any or from drawing way too many theres already a significant amount of luck involved in card games and more luck makes them unbearable
only if you are a true dragons fan you will love this game like i do not every game has to be perfect i love flying around on my dragons and twentyfive bucks to fly on toothless for three months hell yea they do need to update it with more quests tho lol its hard to level a new dragon after doing all the quests with your first one but all in all i absolutely love this game
i would download leauge of legends and spend one thousand in two minutes there than ever reinstall this trash game ever again men who play this game like to watch their wivesgirlfriends get smashed by other men i would write a detailed list of everything wrong with this game but i never read people long reviews either trust me this game is a waste of bandwith and mouse life the game is about as much fun as a visit to the doctor to get your std results
dcs has to be one of the best all round combat flight simulators covering aircraft from ww2 all the way up to near current day airccaft soon to have more aircraft and scenery modules added to the already growing number of study aircraft this is far from an arcade simulation it takes time and effort on users part to even gain a basic level of competence if you have a good basic knowledge of flight and want to improve it further this is as great of a starting point that there is on steam skill in air combat is not needed to enjoy this simulation there are many pilots that fly strictly formation aerobatic freeflight situations on multyplayer servers i have great fun with friends and others ive met while flying this sim online competion is out there on multyplayer if you want to be an ace the options are in the sim to go that route just be forewarned that theres no such thing as ace in a day with this simulator im lucky to get one kill per session and theres been many a day that the totals were zero but i still had a great time while engaged in dcs world i suggest that you try this on steam as it is free to play with two free aircraft included once youve decided to purchace modules it may be best to purchace directly frrom eagle dynamics as newer modules bought in steam wont transfer over to stand alone dcs world installed from eagle dynamics new modules take longer to get from stand alone version into steam release as well theres more sales on at eagle dynamics web store than steam has theres a lot to thiis sim as far as content goes and the future looks very bright for the next new modules that are coming down the pipe any way you cut it this is a great simulator and a ton of fun cya in the skies chybear
i love this game but they have screwed it up so much it aint funny do not spend a dime on it untill it comes out of beata changed the whole tiering system so now me262 fight mig fifteen all the time no german one hundred and nine does not over heat russian plaes that were made in nineteen fortyeights are in the same tier as usa brit japan nineteen fortythrees year of ranking and i could go on game had all the hope you could possibly want finally a game that can burry that horrible thing called world of tanks but nahh they went from a good company to ripping off the customer planes you buy get nerfed wreal money they nerfed the whole pay out system and made it almost impossible to play and yes i have premium a year of it to be honest i never end up with more deaths then kills every match yet i make jack crap in rp you make less in which was once called historical battle because you use to fight nation vs natnion but now they call it real battles or some bs play it but dont spend a dime on it their russians and act like it bias to the hilt stalin was god usa and all eu players are treated like garbage so bad that if you buy gold its the same no conversion between dollars pounds and the euro but if your in mother russia they do the conversion on that pathetic money of theires the rubble

product received for freeearly access reviewwarningthis is my first review so it is probably garbage and i probably use too many examples but tell me how i did here is a tldr version it is ok to frustrating real quick paytohavefun controls oddly and bugs when you don t want it to needs to be flushed out more needs a catchup mechanic the loot crate system is total bs play with friends for three days with free premium then uninstall the game honestly only open this game if you can play nonstop with twenty three friends nonstop for the free premium length this game makes you laugh feel epic and you can really bond with friends with this game but it gets shallow quick here are the problems premium as you guess you need to pay for this it is a bit but you get a free three day trial when you offer up your email nothing too bad on the surface but you can see how it can get bad on the surface i climbed levels way faster than my friend who couldn t get premium to work you get more loot more on this later and the game just became easier you would have noticed free earlier it is paid and not always that good prices can get a bit expensive since you have to build your vehicle there are two limited factors your level cap and your parts you get twice as much paying and you level more so you can use all your shinny things quickly it handicaps the people that are free it is not paytowin but more of a paytohavefun gameplayhonestly kinda loose at times but it is ok as someone use to pc shooters the a and d rotating instead of moving is weird it can get into a lot of stumbling which is nothing something you want when someone sneaks up with a giant shotgun and is about to fire shooting though drove me nuts i really liked being a spider with two large rail guns and harass the flying people but when you are point at a plane coming at you it is shooting lasers and you line up a shot click and nothing it gets infuriating i zoom out to see that my rail gun as accidently shot the ground or my armor or they might have been shot off already or the worse thing ever is no reason now in the game they only let you get together with three friends if you are free or four if you are premium i thought it was strange until i realized why a good fun bit of the game is fighting in hectic chaos but when three friends get together they can just march to your base and wreck you this is why i suggest playing with friendswhen your base is getting assaulted you need to head back to make sure you don t lose then more enemies come and harass then more then more and you die and have to wait for sometimes over a minute to spawn defend die wait to respawn and then watch your base explode you feel hopeless i feel two mechanics are at work one there is no catch up system so if you start losing chances are you are going to lose2 it feels like they take a page from heart stone and try to make your wins to losses 5050this leads to your team face stomping when you do really nothing and you working your off to see everything fall apart no matter how good you play ow and there is no reporting players so you get some cleaver cheaters loot systemso my friend played this a while ago marco if you are reading this hi he told me of an age with cockpits ingame currency and planes not sucking at controls he didn t like the new loot system at all and i didn t see why at first now i do doesn t matter if you are a free to play or paying you get displayed with loot you get and loot you would have gotten if you have paid after a game there are different tiers of loot crates and other reviews go into more detail but it sucks it is random someone can get a rare item in a silver crate while you get stuck with blocks and uncommon garbage in you diamond box you can grind up items you don t want into dust and forge new things you do want from the shop this is highway robbery at the exchanges they have when your team wins your score is doubled so you get better lot so often times the worse player on the wining team will get more and better stuff then the best player who happens to lose this can make a game where you got eleven kills two deaths and many assists to a bronze crate and that is lucky it is just still if you made it this far good for you i would give you all the stuff i got but no in game trading which is a smart move really but you can figure that out
early access reviewthis is overall a great game but it could be better try adding a more precise targetting system everytime im fighting my pet blocks all my attacks when she teleports i dont want to stop her from following me though also sometimes i try to mine small things like red mushrooms but i mine the block underneath insteadi understand this is not complete so im giving helpful feedback on how i think you can make it better
imagine battlefield but bigger six thousands players per server and up to two thousands on each continent persistant online war you can have up to three characters and there are three factions to choose from each faction has their own type of weapons and vehicles the game is very fun to play with friends and it is totally possible to play this game for free but if you do want to spend five dollars or somethingn there are some dlc packs that give you more guns camos and etc it is a solid game and its free so you really dont have much to lose when trying this out it is a solid game and a blast when you get some friends together
interesting game if you love big scale fights this might be for you though it takes a while to unlock weapons without buying cash theres three factions in the game the terran republic vanu sovereign and the new conglomerate the gunplay is quite nice and vehicle combat is great every faction has its own strengths and weaknesses in both their guns and vehicles goal of the game is to capture all or as many basesareas with your team as possible or complete the occasional global missionthough theres issues with the game mainly hacking in some servers is a big problem faction jumpers can be a problem too when one side starts losing everyone bails the ship and moves to the winning side and you start with the weaker guns or abilities for vehicles cbut if ya can look past that and just enjoy the game its worth it its f2p so who cares if its bad i recommend trying it
early access reviewthis game is free so why not five minutes laterrealise that fortnite is also freei quit jk this game have a pretty good graphic but i died instantly to a chicken1010
early access reviewwell supposedly ive played this for five hundred and fiftyseven hrs all i did was leave my laptop running for days on end i forgot about it anyways the game is fun because you get to build a robot and shoot other robots from what i gather from other reviews it has a pay to play feature which i highly dislike it takes a ton of time to get anywhere and youre paired with random people not at all in your skillset compared to what youve builtunlocked so it could be a fun game but really its just frustrating
i have been really enjoying neverwinter and while i havent reached end game yet level sixty cap is seventy i do think this is an excellent game thus far made a note for a few points below pros combat system is the best ive played in any mmo eso ffvi tera and wowfree to playlarge variety of mountsyou can hire companions to fight alongside you npcs and outfit themyou can earn zen market currency without spending any actual moneylots of achievable goals vip is only 10month vs fifteen for wow or ffviguilds can own strongholds and can level up the stronghold for special benefits for their members health exp ectpromotional events where crypted studios or partners give away in game itemsconsprices in the market seem a bit high for items ten for a twentyfour slot bagloot low variety of loot seem to find the same looking loot constantlyno set items havent seen any set items im level sixty i miss the variety of set items from wow leveling up goes by too fastthats all i got for now as far as leveling goes some people may enjoy leveling up quick personally it is too fast for me im almost to the level cap and theres an incredible amount of areas i havent touched overall this is a very fun game thus far and im glad i picked it up highly recommend
early access reviewits a free csgo copy thats made by russians and its pretty terrible but its also fun to waste your time and its extremely easy wouldnt reccomend because you look like an idiot playing it because its a knock off csgo its pretty fun i think it could have potential if the developers stopped copying csgo maps and create some more original
early access review910 in my books close to perfect this game is honestly pretty damn amazing its free its prouced by a good company who makes very realistic game environments and the engine its run on is absolutely stunning yea its obviously supposed to be a joke game all these people in the comments complaining about unbalanced weaponsitems dont seem to understand the fact that this game is meant to be played as a joke as in youre supposed to actually have fun you shouldnt worry about winning or losing in this game i mean sure every single gamer in the world would agree that losing is not as fun as winning but in the end this game is an april fools joke that was built for the purpose of pure enjoyment and if you cant deal with losing in a mature manner then just get gudnote to everyone complaining about gajin net processes you agreed upon downloading the title that the game requires third party eula agreements and gaijin net to be installed and if you have such a huge issue with a third party program that has the purpose of updating your game then just disable it they included the option to do so on the launcher

early access reviewevery super smash bros player and fan should play this game awesome and really fun with great mechanics and it also supports different kind of controllers it works nice witch xbox three hundred and sixty gamepad and also with logitech precision gamepad a fast gameplay for having a great time with friends and other people really appreciated it
"short review for a cute but short spooky horror game spookys house of jump scares is a indie first person walking simulator you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle after this youre given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game the game basically boils down to open door proceed through room open next door it gets old really really fast to keep things interesting the game throws some new enemy types which i honestly couldnt tell apart from the others and they spice things up with the rooms the biggest problem with this game is repetition i think somewhere around seven thousand and eighty of rooms are always empty and are basically the same its really boring to be honest and even the ocasional jumpscare wont impress you after you realise you spent thirty four hours pressing e to proceed in a horror game it had some interesting ideas to it but its just too boring to play i guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been ok but eh it still feels boring and bland to play its ok for the first one thousand, five hundred and twenty minutes but dont expect much to change the good good audiodecent atmospherethe bad lackluster gameplayrepetitive roomslack of variety overallboringa four hundred and ten at best"
early access reviewbig ships bigs guns big explosions and lot of tactics all the ships are very different with very different roles and teamwork is the key to victory more than in any other mobas ive been playing there are no builds or op stuff for you everyone plays at about the same level individual skill isnt vital even if it helps teamwork teamwork teamwork nothing else and with this friendly community thats really fun pros rookie friendly with a simple tutorial good matchmaking and progressive learning curve ships are very different from each others from the light fighter to the superheavy capital spaceship way more players since last free weekend from one hundred and fifty max a day to three thousands average not pay to win except cosmetic or early access starter pack you absolutely dont need to pay to rule the galaxy not another moba the arena is nothing else than an asteroid field ships are really nicecons high pings can occure that can slow the game and can make it difficult to play i think its because there are a lot of people playing it now with the last update the techtree is now larger and its harder to get the ship you really want to have in game movement and camera are hard to master shooting an ennemy behind while fleeing will makes almost everytime you hitting an asteroid and being struck in it maybe a watch behind key would help a bit we want even more ships i hope these will come for free and not as dlc great game overall do not hesitate to get it
at the first time this game is good until i got banned randomly with no reason like seriously no reason i didnt do anything bad like cheatbot or whatever they can check my account if they want right but my point is they did not event reply my email about my problemlike what the hell the costumer support do the if they didnt even read my email at least give a reason why or whatnot just to meif a bad guy do something illegal you supposed to reply their email if they do or not i really want to give a thumbs up for this game seriously but after this accident seriuoslyanyone can get random banned everyday man
early access reviewlets do it really short because i dont wanna put too much time into reviewing a game that is pretty much still in developement and has not too many complex features1 is this game an innovative battle royal well id say its a very fresh new touch to the variety of br games that were released over the last two years or so it has some nice new mechanics startkits and brings a very interesting zone mechanism with a unique endgame2 is this a good game ignoring the facts ive listed above this game honestly needs some decent polishing before i would even bother commenting on the quality of the game in general there are some main issues desync fps some graphical glitches that will probably be worked on very soon its pretty much as goodbad in terms of stability as pubg and i obviously have to make this comparison with fewer fps but less desync and drops and the handling feels a bit smoother overall graphics are pretty neat same bad textures for some objects and terrains as in pubg roe also has some really good qol features that certainly makes it a bit more casual than pubg but also more enjoyable from my pov e g scope swaping autoattach etc3 is this a fun gamel yes snowboarding climbing ziplines paragliding its a lot of fun in terms of dynamic gameplay and movement over the map the gunplay is decent guns feel solid but recoil is pretty much absent you also got hitmarkers4 would i recommend this game yes its free and its more casual and more entertaining than pubg imho so go ahead download it and give it a try youll not regret it its especially enjoyable with friends gliding in a 4man squad or showing off your best ssx snowboard moves while getting to the next zone closing wordswith some time and good decision making by tencent games this will soon be a gem and probably overtake pubgs daily player count on steam its like a mix of a casual pubg and a more mature fortnite without forts and with a lot of snow thanks for reading and have a lot of fun with roe
i learned how to swear in different languages am constantly angry whenever i hear spanish or russian being spoken have learned that there is a whole culture devoted to dota2 hentai also boobs1010 would get
this game isnt worthy of my time anymorei liked this once but the community just keeps getting more and more cancer wich makes playing it just less fun for example i was once playing on a sniper server everytime i killed someone they instantly insulted me even when i go pick on someone else then i get insulted by them and the game is starting to get more and more ier in terms of economy it just isnt fun trading in tf2 anymore heck for the sake of it i deleted my whole inventory and removed the game from my account not like it worked anyway but okeither way this game is terrible
this game is like a giant puzzle every time i unlock new stuff i have to figure out how to put the pieces together to make things work i absolutely love it trying to figure out how to make demons work after ascension two was really interesting the normal things i pick that generally work for most factions didnt work and i couldnt figure out why one night i sat there and tried a bunch of different builds and found something that had worked better than most other builds i used but i couldnt remember what i actually did afterwords this led me to invest alot of time into the demon faction theres so many little pieces you have to set up for them to work and when it works it works seeing a little tidbit of info can make you think i wonder how this would interact with this other thing and youll go off and test how to get it to worki wonder what happens if i stack spell cost reduction on angelsi wonder what happens when i stack assistants with berserkers on goblinsi wonder what happens if i try to get as much mana as possible on titansthings like this have made me waste entire days away messing around with different builds in this game i cant play other idle games anymore this game is just a masterpiece
okey so i got this game not long ago and it was really fun the combat the leveling it is all fun and kinda easy but the game is pay to win you might like reach someone who is pay to win but you will need like months or maybe years of farming ad to make gear like his or buy it in auction pvp on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not you are in pvp with 8k power and the other guy is there with twentyseven k power thats like totally t so pay to win game i suggest you not to waste time in this game unless u are willing to spend money on this game cuz pvp is unbalanced and even pve when they have paid stuff they do hell of dps i would rate five hundred and ten
a great game the time fade away in an undescriptable music as we craft to build our world very nice ambient where some evil creatures came at night to disturb this peaceful world
as a payer with over two thousands hours in this game i think its fair to say i like it why pros one the cartoonish style of the game allows for all sorts of cool and interesting game mechanics such as teleporters2 the game is still recieving new weapons cosmetics maps and bug fixes even though it was relesed in twenty thousand and seventy three theres an enormous ammount of customization and im not just talking about your player you can change the hud and many other aspects of the game4 there are a million ways to play the game using different weapons in your loadout can drastically alter the game itself if you know how to use them5 there is a whole trading economy trading and selling items can literally be a game itself and many people play the game for that reason6 the community surrounding this game is large and vibrant tired of the same old maps there are plenty of community hosted servers that play on fun and unique maps there have even been official updates to the game that have comepletely made of community made items and maps there really is no other developer that works and listens to its community quite like valve7 there really arent many hackers youll see one if you play the game long enough but you can go months without seeing one8 its free cons one no real singleplayer mode there is an offline mode with bots and its good for practice but thats it theres no campaign and the only story is in comics from the official web site which are a good read2 there is a huge learning curve it will take you a long time to learn about all the different weapons and how to use them or where to place your buildings as an engineer or how that spy killed you after you killed him3 new players andor players that arent really familliar with the game are hated with a passion and since it can take a while to learn the game you can expect some hate for quite some time4 its not a good game for casual gamers because of cons two thirty five the few hackers that play the game and there really arent any at all are extremely hard to get rid of they change their name to avoid vote kicksbans spam the chat and are very annoying to play against but as i said in the pros hackers are few and far between and you can always join another server
raceroom dlc dlc that only includes cars dlc that only includes some cars and some tracks dlc that only includes a certain championship with its cars tracks and season features this is the dlc only visible in steam then there is dlc only visible in the game and its own store the store makes special offers that save you money in the store you can also pay for each car and each track this price policy is my reason to not recommend raceroom i cant put a customized raceroom game together that fits my needs and is worth the money at the end of the day this is a terrible business model remember ten years ago you could buy for less money a full racing game with more content than this cash grab and its whole dlc content
early access reviewlives in australia clicks asia five hundred ping gets into game is playable sort of ques for next match cant find one tries later still cant find a match take my money best clicker ive played
early access reviewthere were some initial launch issues but once the loading screen bug was fixed weve played without issues i really like this game and am still having a blast in it there are a lot of people slamming this game right now and it doesnt deserve it neowiz is doing a great job so far as well very pretty engaging game
so im leaving a review here in repsonce to just now this game going live what all the robocraft vets are saying is sadly very true to an embarressing degree its pay to win in so many ways its basically not a free to play to make matters worse they removed pretty much everything that made this game goodi played this game back where pilot seats and such were a thing just like these veterans i just didnt tolerate the t this game turned into we all saw this coming and its absolutely the case if anyone is reading this and interested in the game i suggest you look into like avorion or starmade or hell maybe even ing roblox or something just something that isnt this game
early access reviewphenomenal once again artix entertainment has brought a completely original and engaging game to life i honestly dont know what i enjoy more the team members or the game its self despite being in beta its already chock full of content theres a bit more to be done but thats to be expected i have yet to see another company that can live up to its promises and then some keep going guys youre doing great
new edit at 30122017after changes during seven hundred onward the game did come out of the issues previously stated however theres still some major issues that has and never will apparently be addressed properly one alt smurf troll etc accounts even after the add your phone system there has been no change in the amount of clear alt and troll accounts on the contrary after turbo mode was introduced it seems the old ranked mode is even more filled with people who should just be permanently banned2 scripters issue that is not widely screamed about but is there on this issue i have no idea how well valve is hunting them down and how common it really is what i do know is that you sometimes stumble on players abusing scripts and the only way to really know is to watch and analyze the replay3 overall toxic behavior that will never disappear as long as alt accounts are possible there are just so many players that arent just abusive in chat they intentionally destroy games for the entire team didnt get mid well ill just sit in base and get one hundred xp every five mins from jungle and then sit in base watching youtube again or ill just buy all wards and place them in our fountain because of reason x4 after the talent introduction i feel the game has gone in a downward spiral in terms of balance there has never been so clear meta than after seven hundred every patch there are heroes with insane winrates on all mmr rangesi have to say that iv always thought dota as the best moba out there in terms of gameplay and the insanely high skill cap a much of that remains now that seven hundred came out but in the mean while the gui is to the point that the game doesnt feel right anymore however the issue isnt only the gui a major issue is the new map imo suddenly the map became a super open world that doesnt have the same boundries it used to have theres just way too many ways to invade opposing side of the map making the world feel like its an open arena instead of radiant and dire side i have to say that my first impressions on the new patch is leaving me with the feeling that i dont wanna play dota2 anymore at all edit seventh of feb 2017after some ui fixes the game has started to look like dota again however during these new updates things have gone in other ways a lot worse after some changes to the match making system and report system there has been a significant raise in unjustified low priority games you can get low priority for anything now example muted after three games of summary showing three didnt say a word during those games won one lost two after which a four game winstreak still muted and receive three games in low priority problem is that opponents are able to report you if you play certain heroes you will farm reports like theres no tomorrow i kinda have to say im starting to feel im finally done with this game for good and wont put any more money into it
early access reviewi used to like this game until the last update it started to go downhill on the previous update with the unbalanced weapons read ion distorter now all that made robocraft great and a good progression getting better and better items has now been undone and were left with a gamble at the end of each match it used to be really something to get a bonus of rp the item currency before robits when winning now its a random grind i actually put real money into this and was somewhat annoyed when the higher level stuff i bought got turned into rp or made obsolete by the previous update i can no longer recommend the game to others like ive done in the past pity that freejam decided to ruin things
either you play against a level one that can not summon more than eight hundred atk and def cards or you play against bots that wreck you in two turns no matter what only three playfields instead of five and no more than four thousands lp which kills you in two turns i have to play against bots in auto duel why is that a thing to farm or you know i uninstall this
httyd is a really cool setting which i really love then you got a game based on that setting how can you go wrong well1 the looksgraphics arent everything for sure but this game was released in twenty fourteens and it looks like something made like ten years ago compare this with another mmo such as final fantasy fourteen released four years prior to school of dragons and boy does it look better2 limitationsof course this is a free to play game so it lives of microtransactions and paying memberships which are optional to unlock stuff you need to buy gems which serve as ingame currency but is it really necessary to actually charge gems if you want to delete a character oh and you can only have one character unless you purchase additional slots3 dragonsin the beginning you get to choose which dragon you want the dragon only follows you around and when its grown up you can ride it i have no idea if thats only for looks or if the dragons actually have different skillsets as a nonpaying player you get to choose from four dragons four so i guess the paying member gets a much larger variety right i couldnt check because i didnt have enough gems to delete my character and start a new one but if i remember correctly a paying member gets an additional two dragons to choose from and no the nightshade is not one of them why not offer more variety also when choosing your dragon there are a few options for customization like colors they dont seem to work at least i couldnt change them maybe i chose a dragon that cannot be customized or i need to be a paying member to do so4 the controlsoh boy so moving around on the ground is easy enough if a bit stiff you cant look around while moving but at least you can control the characters orientation with the mouse in flight thats a different story you control the flying direction solely with the keyboard the steering feels very slippery and you constantly have to steer and countersteer to keep the dragon on track as it keeps turning for a while longer after you released the button climb and dive angles are limited some flight school courses actually required you to do a steeper dive or climb than is actually possible seriously why not allow steering the dragon with the mouse you could then use wasd for strafing also attacking or using skills in flight is terrible you actually have to click on the skills to use them youre in flight trying to quickly attack something first you must look and make sure the cursor is placed above the button5 loading timesevery time you change to another area you get a loading screen which is of course used as a canvas for advertising at times the game made me feel like i was walking through a forest of billboards6 settingsthere hardly are any settings to speak of you can toggle sound and music on and off but you cant adjust the volume you can look at the key mapping but you cant edit it you can choose to invert the vertical axis in flight which is a good thing at least you can toggle wether names are displayed above yourself and other players and you can toggle solo and mmo mode thats it summary you can see that i didnt play very long i probably didnt even get to see the main game but seriously what i saw was enough i cant say it was fun the game appears halfarsed and unfinished it looks rushed and like the devs didnt care for it at all and considering the large amount of stuff i was already expected to pay for before i actually started my first mission if thats the sign of whats to come no thanks do i actually have anything positive to say uh the dialogs have partial voiceover which is nice and some areas are nicely designed despite the outdated graphics jumpstart httyd is a great movie which you could have turned into a great game you choose not to you choose to make this a halfarsed thing that begs for money at any given opportunity but it doesnt offer anything i would be willing to pay money for what a waste
i honestly wish i found this game sooner not only is this diablostyle game better than actual diablo it has amazing mechanics i have never seen before in any game the orb currency system is an amazing alternative to a gold system skill gems are an amazing way to customize skills to make them perfect my only problem with the game is that the microtransactions are not so micro almost fifty for a pack of armor skins its a little expensive but hardcore as in heavy not single life players would do it to support the company
early access reviewgame is legit so much fun and its only in beta look forward for future updates definitely a game you should get specially if youre into super smash bros as its similar yet has its own unique element
the card draws are absolutely not random maybe ninety five of my losses ive had turn out like this no possible moves for the first three turns playing catchup and hoping i stop drawing either duplicates of multiple cards i cant use for six turns or only drawing exact same type of cards i dont need in one match by turn two i literally drew five of my six item cards in the beginning of a match with no one to equip them then after surviving the ensuing slaughter with less than ten health stage a miraculous comeback chain around ten cards together and whipe out most of the opponenets board only to have my opponent randomly draw precisely what they need to win that turn being defeated with two full lanes after starting with a worthless hand is antithetical to a good game i dont know if its an attempt to keep wl ratios even which is a t mechanic anywhere but from the beginning of many matches its clear who legends has picked to win in those situations ive only come out on top twice both times because my opponent made a fatal mistake deck based card games never have decent rng this one is no different
i give this game fifty five for being the one best game at displaying how quick microtransaction based ecnonomies can ruin a title the gameplay itself is almost zen like in its approach until they sit you down and make you realize to play further you have to learn how to assemble and disassemble a firearm from start to finish without a single error error here meaning an arbitrary order with no realworld reason for it being like that its a real shame that they decided to try and milk the community for all its worth prosgreat detail to the variety of weapons great way to learn how your own personal firearm heavyxp is given so haphazardly that they clearly want you to buy packs rather than grindthey offer 20k exp and twenty credits to you if youll adver the game and get five other players to play reccomendationsave yourself some time and save money for a real pistol then learn how to assembledisassemble it via a video you get a better experience
"though this game is nowhere near as good as it once was back in twenty million, one hundred and forty two thousand and fifteen id say its still a decent game as long as you can ignore the obvious milking of the mobile apps industry cash grabs for appstore usersfirst off id reccomend pc wot but the nice thing about blitz is its very easy to run even the weakest of pcs can run this game fine i have a core two duo e8400 and no dedicated graphics and i can play at low settings with four thousand and sixty fps for those who dont speak techy which is weird since youre playing on a pc i can play this game with a processor from two thousand and fives and no dedicated graphics card any thing even remotely modern can easily run this gamesecond off its easier than the standard wot 7v7 means that if you even have twelve a brain and use some situational awareness you can have relatively easy success in battlesfinally its just a fun game in general its free obviously theres gonna be micro transactions but looking past that its a great way to pass time"
"hi again everyone happy steam sale its time for another review war thunder is another entry in the ww2 battlefest category and its a vehicular version of fps gameplay featuring playeroperable planes and some tanks that is sure to satisfy some fans of the genre i havent had the opportunity to sample everything the game has to offer but ive sampled it enough to give a good basic review and endorsement based upon the fun hours ive spent in the game so what are the particulars pick a major player from ww2 axis or allies grab a plane and fight or alternatively grab either a russian or german armored ground unit and go to work at the present it appears that ground and air games are completely separated with the alternate form of fighting handled by ai in either game you get some very basic gear to start off with at tier one and work your way up the ladder your achievements in game translate into research points for upgrades as you go your upgrades increase your ability to survive and achieve more as you play you easily earn enough unless things change to purchase better planes and gear without spending real cash theres an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode ive spent nearly all of my time in arcade and thats plenty of fun i will leave the review of realistic and sim modes to someone with much more experience with those therefore please assume my comments are mostly based upon my experiences with arcade the good a lot theres a lot to like about this game even if its a bit f2pmmoey for some what it does right is astoundingly good i think its beautiful play on threemonitor surround if you can add joystick and throttle if you like gamepads anyone or just wing it with a single monitor and mouse the developers aimed to give you many options with this one and it fulfills many of my gamingsim desires involving planes ww2 and lovely landscapes theres an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode ive played many games that attempted to straddle the line between simulator and arcade game and as a result ive logged numerous hours attempting to keep my planes under control while trying to find and engage a distant speck in the sky in war thunders arcade mode you get some level of realism mixed with tons of action action action freedom of choice and strong competition make this game a winner with a large selection of aircraft most of which you must earn or into which you may pay your way a vibrant at this time player community on pc and ps4 make wait times for battle very low the matchmaking is somewhat good because you get placed into a group based upon your skills and gear the pay2win aspect is somewhat mitigated by this because while you can pay your way ahead you can only pay your way so far beyond your peers before you place yourself in a completely different rank of competition skill and brains are requried regardless of your gear and this is a good thing because iron sharpens iron as they say the bad i find theres a serious lack of balance in the game not everyone will agree of course but if you play the starting planes of all nations you can feel the difference some will argue that this reflects the reality of varying levels of tech at the start of the war but i disagree the soviet aircraft and tanks always feel op both on the giving and on the receiving ends i cant tell you how many aircraft ive been shot down in by players in soviet planes i once flew a large bomber which had its tail severed with one blow from a soviet biplane rockets maybe one shot lucky hmmm im not sure ive had wings cut off by soviet fighters like they were made of brittle paper in this game for maneuverability its hard to beat the soviet biplanes for sheer 55kickery its hard to beat their fighters which appear to destroy anything that gets too close to their sights in tank games which only allow german and russian vehicles at this time the russian tanks feel somehow tougher to me the tank gun sights turn colors depending on how likely your round is to pierce enemy armor at the point of aim green for best chance of damage yellow for middling and red for lowest chance at damage comparing tank for tank ive had trouble damaging opponents while using german tanks and a green crosshair while at the same time destroying opponents in one shot using a russian tank with a red crosshair if you fly british or japanese beginning fighters and the russian beginning fighters on the same day for the first time after youre experienced with the mechanics of the game just as i did before writing this review you can feel the difference in the aircraft for each nation the russian aircraft felt better were more maneuverable and i scored more hits kills and assists with those than i did with any other nations aircraft at that time for that level crews being completely new and all other elements somewhat equal gaijin is russian i suppose that says all that needs to be said and ive had issues with gaijin over their moderation in other games in the past take it for what its worth its one informed opinion youre entitled to your own which i hope you will develop on your own by playing this game regardless some might claim that the russian aircraft were just that good but i offer you this quote from wikipedia by one thousand, nine hundred and thirty eight the soviet union had the largest air force in the world but soviet aeronautical design was distinctly lagging behind western technological advances instead of focusing on developing tactical aircraft the soviets engineers developed heavy bomber planes only good for long distance in other words planes that would be used for recordbreaking flights like those of chkalovs the soviet governments focus on showy stunts and phenomenal recordbreaking missions drained resources needed for soviet defense when nazi germany attacked the soviet union in june1941 it quickly became apparent that the soviet air force was not prepared for war http en wikipedia june twenty 2014the ugly i only have two complaints and then ill move on first dont make any statements in chat that anyone might find remotely disagreeable because the community has a good number of loudmouth jerk trolls even if you say nothing chances are good that youll read something hilariously asinine while playing if you play for a bit a few idiots like to tk and in that respect its no different from any fps second youre going to get botted just accept that fact quietly and move on when it happens try to open the scoreboard click the name of the person who did it and report them for botting its made inconvenient on purpose so fewer people will file complaints especially false ones in my experience if you say anything about it in chat you will catch flak from some jerk seriously if someone gets lucky thats not an issue for me if someone is shooting at me for any length of time and they hit my pilot that in general is fine but heres my experience of what is happening for your consideration scenario one im flying along i hear br less than a second of gun sound and my pilot is knocked unconscious on replay i watch a guy fly into position shoot a couple of rounds if that and fly away immediately after all of that adds up to bot in my mind scenario two im flying along in a bomber same thing happens one guy simply turned off my engines just that fast without any apparent damage otherwise most often however my pilot is just knocked out my thing is this if they shoot me through my plane wouldnt the rounds have hit something on the way in thus doing damage to the plane as well as knocking my pilot unconscious a few scenarios present themselves saying that it could happen otherwise but i find it happens all too often"
uses peer exchange by default to download updates isp auto blacklists me everytime i try to play since torrents use the same connection to download files you can turn this off but a game this popular should use its own dedicated download servers by default not a peer exchange system i shouldnt need to boot up vpn software just to be able to play this game to turn off peer exchange otherwise light paytowin mechanics in an otherwise very fun game
well if you broke up with your girlfriend and having pain start playing this game you will face with drunks and russians and that makes you cancer so that cancer will make your pains end shortly
i used to play the game card when i was a kid thanks to konami they are bringing back the good memories i have this game in my iphone and i play it everyday and it feels amazing also the game has a lot of spelltrap cards and each card does an effect build your deck with your strategy and have fun i recommend this game
early access reviewreally fun to play in geforce now but still dont know why people are still butthurt about the malware this is how you uninstall it how to remove gaijin agent the agent is not malware as some very uninformed individuals here claim with absolutely no evidence to support their case it is nothing but disinformation the agent acts very much like a number of software update programs even your operating system and anti virus software does this to remove it for windows seven open a command line press winr or click on the start button and use the seach line enter msconfig exe into the text box in the system configuration tool go to the startup tab and disable uncheck the gaijin net agent on win8 ten open the task manager select the startup tab and disable the gaijin net agent shut down the gaijin net agent in the system tray right click to get the exit option if you want to completely remove the agent you need to go to the following folder and delete it c appdata folder can be hidden in some installations https support gaijin if you remove it do not then moan and complain about long downloads etc when a major update of the game is released this is one of the things the agent minimizes
product received for freeearly access reviewthis game wass good until they added epic lot update before i had likely 6700points but now im only have seventyone think they did beacase users should buy items for real money and the prices on items are the same dont donate this game suck ten
if you havent played this game yet im surprised if you like realistic two thousands player battles set in a time where giant mech suits and forcefields exist youll like this side note youll need a pretty good computer mine isnt sufficient
early access reviewthe game had some really bad issues at the lauch that didnt allowed me and many players to play but we overlooked it we insisted on it didnt refund it cause we really wanted to play with our friends we kinda wanted to believe things would get better anyway i dont like pvp but i follow my friends around i absolutely love pve content i also hate slow pve that thing where you take forty five seconds to kill a single simple monster i dont mind long boss fights i kept playing bless because its pve was fast i dont have patince for boring fights cause it makes me literally sleep in my chair and thats what the devs made in this last patch as soon as the autorefunds were turned off i dont recommend it for anyone that dislikes super slowpaced pve content and probably pvp too so yeah i might change my review in the future but i needed to express my discontent somehow
early access reviewi kinda have the feeling that this games developer is a salty magic player this game has a bad ruling fast spells doesnt recognize whats called player turn priority also seventyfive cards in a deck thats too many even standard magic only has sixty cards even the mulligan is worse than magic the good thing bout this game is you can play for free by grinding in gauntlet also the arena draft is kinda interesting cus you get to collect what you draft
"early access reviewdownloads game because friend likes this gameplays sniper modeaccidentally equips the wrong loadout so you only get a knifegets twentyseven kills in that roundgets second place for most kills in that same round first place having three hundred and nineteen thousand, five hundred and ten would kill a sniper with a knife again"
early access reviewmy review of hg where do i start this game has changed alot since i last played itthis game has turned for the better the ui looks nicer as well as the matchmaker is better and when i came back to the game i was greeted with a crap load of creditsgoldwarbonds and a veterian mebership if your an old player of this game who got bored or fed up of the game its worth getting back to itdid i mection that the grinding is a tad bit better
early access reviewthis game is broken bad combat system server disconnects awful video lag etc the company knew it was broken and took our money anyway thieves also this is the last game i buy on steam because no refund despite the game being misrepresented shame on all of you involved
"early access reviewfirst thing i want to say is ive had this game for over a year i bought the harbringer pack and a few thousand platinum a good two thousand, five hundred and thirty dollars i enjoy it tremendously im at nearly three hundred hours as you can see xd and i must say every second was enjoyable also stunned by the amount of progress this game has made amazing graphics love the blend of fps and strategy this game offers gah not good at long reviews here are some things i like graphics lovely such graphic the community best community ever i mean it the fact that i get to talk to developers and be listened to zero it makes me feel special yall probably dont remmeber me hahahthe team play aspect much wow many friendgraphics amazing the constant addition of new ships and features i disappeared for a month or two and i swear theyve changed the logo and added like six new ships plus other really cool features awesome graphics the fact that i can run it on my oced pentium thirtytwo fiftyeights forty four ghz for you nosey people and gtx750ti on highultra settings many fpses wow graphics did i mention the graphics things i dont like the fact that i can only play an hour or so a day much bummerthe lack of steam achievements they would be so coolthe occasional crashes keep in mind it is still a fairly new game i still love it such review such words much wow dogearmyps join the doge army pps we have cookies ppps such cookie many yum"
early access reviewstay away from this gamean absolutely horrible start day one got stuck with the loading screen bug i had to reastart my game about sixteen times each time i crashed the game had horrible optimization in some areas duplication bug destroy the economy in one day i got forced to join one server then they locked it and added new servers so my five friends were not able to join me they wanted me to pay irl money to warp to a dungeon another fun part about dungeons is people spawn kill you as you leave it day two more of the same crap day three my ranger made it to fortyfive and five all my gear and got one shot by a level thirty mage player day four went to a level twentyeight pve area and farmed items to level my gear day five they nerfed all classes and me and my level fortyfive mage friend were haveing trouble killing a level twentyeight mini boss we would do six combo attacks and it barely touched the health of the mob something i was farming before that took six hits to kill now takes two players around twenty hits i try to get a refund but no luck stay away from this game
walking around secluded area while searching for loot hoping meeting humans for survival got shot before even able to chat or talk what a community this game not recommended to play srsly waste of time been walking wihout knowing what to do worst
early access reviewguys wtf dont buy this game until they fixed all the bugs refund this garbage game and wait till its all fixed i cant recommend this game loadingscreen freeze fps drops fps low asf with a highend pc to few servers for eu torm incomming
early access reviewi reccomand this game becouse awesome fights you will not get bored annnnd is very funnyive got smashed by a hammer and kicked away of the screen with a single punch1010 i will get punched again
i know i have almost one thousands houts in this game and its because i am too deeply entrenched to leave it i am a saddo so i could get throught the horrific grind for items that are compared to other factions i play as soviets game is unbalanced and broken atm however it has lots of potential this is the only combined arms game i know come back in ten years see where its at but for now stay away from this cesspool
so the thing about this is that the community is full of dbags and you cant get any straight answers to your questions like ever theres no proper tutorial which should tell you how to figure shiit out on your own and basic pretty important stuff like basic shiity game mechanics or even something as simple as checking your own fuuucking experience on any single character its pretty fun to muddle through because you dont really have to know anything to keep on playing but if you get frustrated easily you should avoid this horsecrap like the plague
early access reviewi wish the reviews had a neutral option the game has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be the top ccg it by far has the best single player ai of any game in the genre there is a very fun and free single player mode vs the ai that gives you lots of cards gold they are very generous and make the collection building much easier than other games the ranked system is actually very well done you need one hundred points to rank up and every win gives you some points and a loss takes some away you gain more points for wins than points loss for losing i have a few key issues with this game which is the main reason i only really play to do daily quest now and instead play elder scrolls legends with most of my time elder scrolls legends is by far the bes ccg available and its a shame nobody has heard of its kind of funny that dire wolf is also doing elder scrolls but yet that game blows away eternal anyway lets get into the actual problem the decks are just too large with seventy cards but they do allow for up to four copies of each card carrying four copies of each with seventy cards is not the same as having a thirtyfive card deck with two copies of each your extra copies or even all of the copies of one card can and often do end up in the latter 23rds of the deck which never see play there are just too many total cards to be able to have very consistent gameplay i have spent a little over half of my time playing ranked matches and i have had only a couple of games that actually felt like good solid games on both sides just for a comparison elder scrolls has almost every game feel like a good close game with the winner being determined based on skill more than rng the other ninety nine of games were just blowout wins or losses too often the game is decided in the opening hand whoever wins or loses is more often a question of which player gets a better distribution of their sigils rather than who actually played better or had a better constructed deck you put fifty cards into the deck and then you are forced to put at least twentyfive sigil cards if you want to play a one cost unit then you must first play one sigil to play a two cost unit requires you to have played two total sigils and you can only play one sigil per turn in theory this is a good idea but their system needs some serious tweaking to make the gameplay feel balanced ninety of the games end with fifty cards left into the deck too often you will have cards in your hand but then cant play them because you draw a sigil for six turns in a row the other thing that happens is that you only draw minions spells but no sigils i hate winning a game for no reason other than my opponent drew sigils for six straight turns while i bashed his face in i also equally hate losing for this same reason the mulligan system will allow you to either keep or replace all of your cards which does not help these things from happening if the developers will fix the sigil issue and cut the size of the deck by about ten cards then would be a perfect game the way the game is right now i would recommend it if you like magic as its really close in gameplay or hate the other ccgs youre currently playing you would be better off checking out elder scrolls legends because until this game is more balanced esl is just a better game all around
early access reviewthe new reward system has ruined the game in its entirety getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept but there are multiple issues with this it removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck it encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates i e getting points from capping towers that are almost capped is far greater than doing it yourself the item sell values make it near impossible to actually aquire items from the shop without massive ammounts of grinding premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want the premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept but showing the players what they missed out on because they didnt put money into your game even if they have in past and got burned on it because of the recent changes is just cruel i played this game for a while before the recent overhaul had quite a few hightier blocks and hightier weapons the former of which cost quite a lot of ingame currency only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player meaning the amount of time i spend prior to the change was completely pointless save for aquiring levels translating to more cpu in summary the recent overhaul screwed over a number players myself included the only progression available is that of pot luck and has never been more paytowin with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legendaires more readily available in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want far sooner than normal players

its awesome it is even better than diablo three and its even for free and defenetily the first freegame i really like cant believe theyr making a game like this for free but u can buy ingame items and stuff with real money if you want to
played the game on bethesda launcher before it was released on steam finished the free single player campaign but never player pvp it felt like a mixture of magic and hearthstone the deck construction is like magic where you can mix up to two classes of cards while the battle system is like hearthstone where magicka like mana crystal in hs grows up by one each turn and how attack works there are also supports and items which are pretty much similar to the artifacts and equipment in magic creature abilities are basically a sum of both games summon battle cry guard taunt breakthroughtrample last grasp deathrattle lethalpoison drainlifelink pilfer regenerate etc it does introduces something new in this game mainly the two lane system where each lane is its own battle ground so youll have to be more tactic about distributing your creature cards on the field also the special rules of each lane stealthlike right lane and levelspecific left lane makes it worthwhile to consider which lane you want to lay down your card in a way its a reinvention of magics flying creature mechanism theres also the rune sytem which acts like secret from hs that let you draw one card when losing certain amount of health there are cards that interact specifically with such mechanism secondgo player are quite compensated with jewel rings that are like the extra coin in hs but you can use it three times i have to agree with what others said about the balancing i feel that the three uses of jewel for secondgo is a bit too much but at least its not completely unplayable for firstgo player also im not a hug fan of 50card minimum requirement for deck construction this makes it extremely hard for beginners to build decent decks that dont contain filler cards which essentially lower your chance of draw combo cards overall i still think this is definitely a game worth playing you can play through a quite lengthy campaign for free and unlock others with ingame currency that you earn theres even a solo arena mode like in hs but you play against ai great for pve players like me i think it finds a balance between the casual side of hs simpler rules and faster pace and the hardcore side of magic creature abilities deck construction its a game you dont have to heavily invest your time in you can simply pick up and leave any time when you have around 15min to spare good for killing time it would however be even better if its brought to mobile device which i think its going to happen for even better access to game its very light on hardware and friendly to touchscreen i would simply keep the game installed so that you can play it while waiting for a class to begin or having a coffee at starbucks
i would have recommended this game two years ago now there are about eighty less players than what it was and it takes ages to find a match and if you do your ping is probably really bad aswell as that the germans are op sadly this is the end of this beloved game
really bad its a poor dayz clone user interface is terrible the worst cant start a game with friends there is too much randomness to things ingame the game modes dont add much gameplay and dont have any goals imo stay away
a pretty cool sandboxsurvival gamethe inspiration in minecraft is obvious but i am very glad it didnt just stay there and changed in many ways from there the crafting system could be slightly better maybe all recipes that just require you to have something could be unlocked from the start except those that require finding the recipe but i understand the intention of keeping it simple for new players the other cool thing is how easy it is to invite other players to play with you since the game is entirely cloudbased my only reservation is in the fact that you cannot play the game at all while offline but well what do i expect from an otherwise pretty great free to play game
not for the faint of heart of patience but if you enjoy diabloesque gear grinders this will definitely scratch that itch be prepared to understand nothing and feel a bit overwhelmed by the passive tree id recommend picking a build from a site like timstips and following it for your first character since theres no sort of tutorial and its very difficult to undo large mistakes made during leveling once youve played a character through the first couple difficulties you will likely understand what you do and dont like about it and be able to better build a new one despite being a free to play it is not a pay to win all things in the premium shop are either consmetic or quality of life items but nothing is required if youre like me and waiting for diablo three to do something meaningful path of exile can help fill the void

its an awesome game but very hard for newcomers after a while though its the most rewarding fps out there there is no other game like it i advise everyone to visit planetside two subreddit to look for help in how to learn this game to make your experience easier and more fun you can also ask people ingame they are incredibely helpful
highly competitive shooter for tryhards make no mistake on that valve markets it as something else but it doesnt change what it is its not easy to pick up if youre new to quakelike shooters youd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you or you might get frustrated by some things public pvp and pve known as mvm in tf2 servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned if you dont want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though well balanced competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test despite valve overlooking the competitive format multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level if you want to do team based esports look no further than tf2 this game has more competitive spirit in it than lol and dota combined as for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age thanks to its stylised look some items from content updates are very much out of the games theme though which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is the game is poorly optimised in some instances too especially mvm but that can be solved by fps boosting configs all in all iz good
early access reviewi love this game ive played magic since second grade and this is the first time i feel like there is a another ccg worth my time pros you dont need to constantly spend money you play to earn your cards i think this is the most fun part of the game it would be much less fun if they just handed you all the cards although youll probably want to spend some money to keep this game going drafting is awesome you draft four packs and keep every card you draft as well as prizes depending on how you do standard meta feels very balanced nothing feels broken so many different deck types that are competitive you can win one pack each day for winning a casual or ranked match as well as new quests every day to earn ingame gold i usually have more than enough gold to draft anytime i want tocons art style is a little cheesy had to think of something oh and the story line in the campaigns is super dumb
early access reviewthis game is basically unplayable for me i play cs go with twelve hundreds dpi and one hundred and six ingame sensitivity but warmode just doesnt have the options that cs go has also there are more russians on here than on cs go especially ones who dont speak english but the best way to play this game is by uninstalling it i had a thirty killstreak with no deaths after uninstalling and now im top of the leaderboard
i got banned for no reason left the game and then tried to reconnect it said disconnected and it crashed then said your are banned for exploiting or cheating un ban me did nothing
early access reviewthis is like a cross of csgo and cod but people are not as toxic right now we got a boat load of goodies for the one year anniversary so you dont have to buy everything high pingers get kicked out automatically lots of weapons to play with but they only offer few maps better hit reg that cod best of all you dont feel like someone robbed you in three months when the hype of the new cod wears out
early access reviewnot like pubg has its own twist to it edit needs some updates and to developers why dont you post whats being updated on the game you didnt post any of the updates and its been updated four times since release why also i heard a few ppl saying this game installs malware is it true
early access reviewtdm is fun but it has too less game mods and at one point you will get bored to do the same thing with the same weapons not that its hard to get weapons but they feel very similar events are also nice
with each and every update this game just keeps getting better and better rre competes on every level with any aaa title released to date this game in my opinion is fast becoming a work of art graphically and technically rre has exceeded all my expectations and cannot be overlooked by any sim racer the driving experience is very realistic and suited to players of all levels the ui is particularly nice and offers everything you could possibly think you want options are really well laid out in a manner which suits the whole presentation package perfectly a lot of work and thought has went into this title and anyone who loves attention to detail will no doubt agree this is one of the very best sim racers available on pc if not the best rre also has some of the best force feed back and ffb options i have experienced in any racing title simply awesome one thousand and ten a must have sim

unplayable the menu here is full of bs when you go to the play button ingame you can go and play right well when you go to the only gamemode you can go to since youre a newbie it has the fleet customization tab pop up and theres nothing you can do to fix it fleets tab gets in your way so you cannot press anything this is a game breaking bug after about four restarts on the game it loads the play button in thats alot of reloading then theres the really constant appearance of the one negative one you cant buy any of the components needed to get to the tier two items but restarting will fix it good game but my thumbs down indicate a bug fix needed
luckily heroes and generals is a free game the footage of the game and what you have seen of it before is often very misleading while larger battles with vehicles and forty people can be fun you need to unlock the ability to fight in these by ranking up the process would be fine if the game was entirely functional and complete it isnt the gunplay is clunky and forced and everything about movement and aiming feels very unnatural its a mix between the camera beign too slow as well as lacking accuracy i e the camera feeling desynced from your mouse and aiming at moving targets becomes a challenge in its own right youll often find a close quarters engagement often turns into who can empty their magazine first and hope to hit something and even then a regular firefight gives no sense that you are actually hitting anything furthermore even on maximum settings the game looks very graphically unpolished the resolution and application of textures is poor and the fx might as well not be there becasue at best it actually detracts from the game ive seen roblox projects with better blood effects perhaps the largest issue with this game is the lack of player base getting into a normal match usually takes upwards of five minutes if not ten or more the game might be a bit more fun if you were in a match faster but the gameplay is absolutely not woth the waste of time i would give the game a five hundred and ten nothing about the game is debilitatingly awful just poorly made or downright underdone
early access reviewwhile i do agree the grind is about as repetitive as you can get and the overwhelming push to get you to spend money is a bit much its still an otherwise enjoyable game i enjoy playing it when i need essentially a time killer
product received for freeits a great game involving strategdy trial and error and fun competitions and hackers yep wonderful hackerrs in the competitions steal your well earns medallions until the hacking is fixed its not as fun
this game is amazing i have put many hours into it one hundred on steam and many more on the website i have been playing it ever since it came out deca just bought this game from kabam and is updating it so far they are communicating with the community and the game is going in a better direction give it a try
i wasnt an old player in this game i started playing this game when my friend introduced me to the game i didnt like it much first of all there are constantly people crowding around the nexus spamming messages like ey buy my stuff on this random website not just one person either imagine a whole army of people afk just spamming useless messages using bots second of all really good loot is hard to come by you play for a long time and if youre really lucky you might get t3 or t4 items i once played through for three hours but not get any items above t4 good items theyre all in the shops and all of them are super op and great free to play btch please this aint no free to play game people who pay killsteal you at boss battles and the others the freemium players they wont get anything because the mob of p2ps cleared everything if kabam stopped owning this game i would play it more otherwise its almost a complete piece of sht
rotmg is a good game for those who enjoy a challenge and people who will not quit and get extreamly upset over a character dying and losing everything on said character rotmg recently was bought by a company known as deca games and they are very active in the community compared to how the previous owners of the game kabam who neglected the game for a few years rotmg or realm is a really fun game if you can get passed its difficult points and is all around a great time if you treat your time playing realm with a positive attitude towards the game
name
it dont get any more simulation than this epic game with stunning visuals huge learning curve when trying to master just one jet and thats the beauty of it there is so much to learn and master
smite has the potential to be a great game unfortunately hirez gets in the way of it every chance they get they do absolutely nothing to address the god awful community this game has game balance or the several bugs prevelant in this title hirez makes it pretty obvious that thier only plan is to produce more skins which do look great at rediculous prices and gouge what players they have left for as long as they can anything requiring real effort on their part outside of this will be ignored
this games a little over my head in terms of detail the controls allow you to manage far too many different aspects of the plane for my taste i did finally get the hang of flying but after trying and failing to arm and use my weapons for the thirtieth time i know this game is not the one for me maybe ill try again sometime when i have some hours to memorize the keys and their modifiers of which there seem to be a couple hundred this is not a game for simple people like me
i payed ten bucks a month to go shoot pixel deer and cry about my life why did i waste money on an extremly repetative pay to play cleverly disguised as free to play i didnt it wasnt a wasteful purchase at all because it taught me to be more careful about what i spend money on i learned that things arent always what they seem sometimes you download a free to play game and sometimes ew s you in the without lube dont call it an f2p if its not420 ign this game gave me cancerbola
meh its somewhat fun heres my issue the game kinda boottotheneck grinds your face the tutorial i get do this okay now do this but after the tutorial the game still doesnt let you really play to your liking it still tells you what you can do next which is only ever one option basically most of the game is click next to continue and that button moves then you get to battle yay then go back to click next to continue whats that you wanted to buy more consumables to help you nah you gotta buy a tank from another country now but i wanna upgrade my gun tough now sell that important thing you probably will need but i wanted that here let me buy one back from the shop nah time for battle that this game if i wanted a comic about tanksvideo games ida downloaded that
after initially being very impressed by this game after slow and stale development is has slowly lost its charm and now is left in other racing sims dust simbin are now masters of empty promises maybes and excuses stay away from this game
early access reviewplayed for almost an hour but had to get back to work but this game is amazing so far i say this is the free alternative to minecraft very easy to get started crafting is easy i can see myself playing this for a period of time every day i also like the more modern texture appearance of the blocks only thing ive noticed is that occasionally there is very high server latency of over 1000ms aside from that i give this game five stars thus far
early access reviewfirst good battle royale game since pubg100 in my top three games and i usually play car games or ark would recommend this game for a lot of fun and a great open world experience
early access reviewabsolutely fun game i was checking for a few games thats free to play and this one i kept playing till five hundred and thirty in the morning for nine hours straight you can play it either in single player or pvp and sp is a lot of fun the graphics are fantastic just like in hearthstone and they have alot of elements from magic the gathering without the complete complexity or adding the extra chores from it when you versus other people the wait time is only a few seconds so there are a heap of people playing right now i cant be bothered writing a review so try it out they are very generous at the moment so get in and get all your free stuff and play against the ai or other players and rake it all in before they change it where theyre less generous
early access reviewmy most favoured hated game d its fabulousness ugliness and originality yeah originality my just shine through the heavens deepests of holes it is fully recommended not to get this beautiful ugly as fk game it only costs zero dollarsi want my zero dollars back when you are banned put out of misery then dont worry or just leave this game lmao just spend over six hundred dollars to unban yourself dont seems legit yes one hundred septillion fifty sextillion three hundred and fiftytwo quintillion four hundred and five quadrillion eight hundred and two trillion four hundred and thirtynine billion six hundred and eightythree million four hundred and nine thousand six hundred and fiftyfour million quadrillion vigintillion million trillion 10would spend six hundred dollars again
this game is fun for about two days then it gets lame you do the same thing over and over again new town defeat dungeon new town defeat dungeon etc unbalanced pvp and you only spam x z then maybe two skills minute three hundred and ten
note the review has been updated to include the campaigns content neverwinter is an mmo by perfect world entertainment this allows us to predict two things one the amount of cash required will be huge2 the classes will be split into the usual archtypes starting out youll get to pick your race between all the usual dd races and have a choice of class this confirms suspicion two in that there is the devout cleric healer guardian fighter tank and a bunch of other classes damagedealers youll have an option between the control wizard which deals a lot of damage from a distance has the ability to crowdcontrol multiple enemies throw enemies off cliffs which is invaluable at highlevel dungeons as its an instantkill and is very very squishy the main job of this class apart from throwing enemies off ledges is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss the great weapons fighter which is a berserker with a twohanded weapon standard frontline damagedealer this class can either target the boss or the adds depending on equipment and the specific boss in question the trickster rogue who relies on stealth for soloplay and does singletarget damage in dungeons this classs main job is to kill the bosses the hunter ranger who frankly has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard the hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses the skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances combat is simple in this game you have two at will attacks much akin to autoattacks which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default those do not have cooldown though they can have charges you then have three encounter skills which are basically active skills mapped to qer by default lastly you have a daily power which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often the skills require a certain amount of action points which are gained by doing classspecific tasks healers heal damagedealers deal damage and i assume tanks block or absorb damage though i havent made one to confirm it these could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to one and two by default theres the feat system which is basically passive bonuses for your character and then theres the two active passives slots those are skills that give you passive benefits but are not feats meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points and you can only have two of those at a time you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar you can have more skills but those are the most you can have useable at any one time equipment is your standard mmo system five rarity levels which are in order white common basic equipmentgreen uncommon equipmentblue rare equipmentpurple epic equipmentorange purple equipment is also split into tiers tier one is obtained from the basic level sixty dungeons while tier two is obtained from more difficult level sixty dungeons so far so standard where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it something like sockets in diablo and those have several ranks you can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine up to a one success rate at level eight rank ten is the highest if you spend real money you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed well this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money but lets pretend it doesnt and go on i should probably mention the artifact system these are items that you can equip up to three of one primary and two secondaries which you can refine like the enchantment stones like the enchantment stones you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process the primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats each player gets one at level twentyone in a bind on equip state though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip this bug appears to be unique to the artifacts the game features a companion system free players get a white one which can reach rank fifteen equivalent to player level thirty for twenty five you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank thirty equivalent to player level sixty bag space is of course limited in order to increase it players must pay real money the large bag costs twenty four slots ten storage space is likewise limited and more storage slots can be bought for real money pvp exists but theres no real matchmaking system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced its a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better onehitkills are fairly frequent storywise there isnt that much there it would appear r a salvatore wrote the begining then the lore then the new campaigns and then left the entire midgame forward youll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city the writing is what you can expect from salvatore your enemies are more evil than the combination of satan and hitler while you are playing as the puregood hero who cant even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill for rogues or kit items that will clutter up your inventory the campaigns which i mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game unlike other parts of the game they revolve around daily quests which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character which require astral diamonds read on for those and access to two endgame instances with some of the best equipment unfortunately the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high which will hurt new players who want to pvp and of course i saved the worst for last the game features a currency called astral diamonds you receive this currency from various daily tasks playing playercreated content completing dungeons playing in pvp in a rough form and must refine them in order to use them the currency is gated at a refinement of twentyfour thousand a day a very small amount for free users but players can trade real money for more astral diamonds is used to buy various useful items vanity items new companions new mounts upgrade the rarity level of a companion from white to green or green to blue or blue to purple or a mount same as the companion as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character from the campaign quests now the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering it costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green that is an amount free players will not get before reaching the levelcap unless you sell your artifact you can get another one if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack to top all of this off the game is riddled with bugs geometry bugs item bind bugs enemy behavior skill behavior etc and the nowinfamous perfect world entertainment support is just worthless so overall would i recommand this game well if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet by all means go ahead and indulge in this extremely paytowin experience otherwise no im afraid i cant recommand it
early access reviewit is fun has good mechanics doesnt present new things doesnt abuse the online element like hearthstone does ex bomber nosdormu and all the other weird cards its pretty old school to be honest too old school dont get me wrong i like mtg but this game lacks a lot because of this powerenergy system sometimes in draft i get five cards that i can draw lands with but they dont appear and if they do appear i have the wrong type of land most of my games were decided from the first draw which makes it so not fun for me for a skillaccented game it is pretty luck based with this weak starts still it has cool stuff and i prefer playing against ai cuz it aint taking ages but i just dont reccommend it
ignore the poor reviews no different than any other free to play game you get what you pay for free account lets you hunt mule deer and rabbits subscriptions or one time hunting licenses for time periods let you get a shot at the rest other stuff such as tents etc are perks and flare
early access reviewthis game is awesome ive played a ton of magic and this is similar but better the card set is a masterpiece created by a bunch of magic halloffamers very highly recommended give it a try
the game itself is pretty interesting for a moba but inevitably poor matchmaking makes me unable to recommend it if you care about having a good competitive experience one regularly encounters long streaks five games of noncompetitive rounds where your team is simply overmatched as a group and doesnt even sniff destroying an objective or two as the opposing team just rolls over you which after awhile is pretty uninspiring inversely its also much more common in my experience to blow out the other team than have a tight backandforth round where your actions really do matter id say optimistically that maybe ten or so of my matches were actually close with wellmatched teams when the matchmaking does work it is pretty good fun but sadly its a much rarer of an occurence than i am willing to put up with
early access reviewit reminds me of dota and lol just without the creeps people need to hold and push down spacelanes acordingly capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships once your teams ships are strong enough to take on the enemies final base a window must be seized perhaps when some enemies are respawning its a great game requiring tactics teamwork patience and planning shame the only people i come across seem to be incapable of understanding this bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know if both blobs pick oposite lanes whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice if both blobs meet they fight the blobs will then reform and repeat the most excruciating part though is waiting for a game i recomend this though in the hopes that one day enough tacticly minded people will play this beautiful game and ill start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles
early access reviewi have played this game hours at a time i am addicted i have managed to get two of my friends addicted as well the only problem i have with the game is just my problem neither of my friends experience it so it isn t a problem and i can live with it since i don t have to deal with it much but if you have to know what it is the light the extractor gives off makes me a little sick for some weird reason but only when i look right at it if i turn away i am no longer sick but it only happens for me so i m not too concerned it s so funny and you don t have to use it often that i just don t care
if youre into combat flight simulators look no further dcs offers a chance to step into a legendry aircraft with unparalleled precision and accuracy true to its original design granted you may be reading a book for about a month until youre at a minimum proficiency with the aircraft but the payoff is worth it the sense of achievement that you get when you learn any of these aircraft is amazing as its not just a case of pumping the throttle to maximum to take off like other plane games the future is very bright for this simulator as it is ever growing with more developers creating different aircraft for different theatres of war i e wwii korea 80s modern

backstab someone with an icicle they ll instantly transform into a highlydurable ice sculpture team fortress two 20072010this was a teambased first person shooter involving two identical teams differing only in color and artistic design vying for control of various strategic locales around the world you could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes the various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team however this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were and still are generally foreign concepts teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit hats were just a cool side thing many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat overall team fortress two was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved over nine out of nine worth the weight hat fortress two 20102012the mannconomy update released on september thirty two thousand and ten marked the end of team fortress two and the birth of hat fortress two players no longer needed to idle to get hats they could also buy them trade for them and even sell them for other hats in addition keys were also introduced giving players the ability to throw away their parent s or their own hardearned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats more often than not they ended up getting worthless virtual guns the mannconomy fever quickly swept over team fortress two reducing it to a side game hat fortress two was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the team fortress two minigame to show them off to others the freetoplay update in twenty elevens further enlarged the player base increasing the popularity of hat fortress two its modes and related fun minigames as hat fortress two was further refined and developed new elements were added including unusuals and nonhat cosmetic items eventually so many new cosmetics came in that hat fortress two gradually evolved into another game11 hats out of 10dressup fortress two 2012presentthis is the current and ultimate form of team fortress two the game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play you can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes andor by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there you can show off your outfits topped off with exorbitant unusual hats in a multitude of ways you can do the conga hifive other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits play intense games of rock paper scissors or play jack black s guitar you can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old team fortress two you could also play mann vs machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become the man with the golden gun if neither of those are satisfactory there are a wide range of other minigames to play some of which have been around since the days of old team fortress two they include but are not limited to versus saxton hale freak fortress two jailbreak balloon race tf2 kart magic spells in halloween event maps slender fortress surf maps jump maps and tf2ware in conclusion dressup fortress two does provide something for everyone so i guess it s alright1110 iterations of gaben and my favorite class is the spy thanks and have fun
very much enjoying this game can see myself replaying game few times a week or monthits fun even vs the ai surface looks great variety of ships freeunder pvp need more players game needs player rankings like world of tanksdown deep
love this steep learning curve but once you get the hang of it you have hours of game play ahead of you also you have the option of buying dlc to unlock more planes if you want
i think this is the best card game available online right now if you love the manamagicka system creature to creature combat and a deep strategy experience the two lanes and the runes add a lot more in depth to playing and deck building than obvious at first glance it is f2p playable meaning that the rewards you can get by playing are really generous and capable of getting you a t1 deck in a reasonable timeframe not to mention that the developers really care about the game and the community and not only about their revenues as of today you can get daily twitch drops which are worth like ten you get daily quests for gold arena can give you 4packs entry fee for 7wins and you can even farm the ai for soul gems
as a player that has played on and off for more than four years i can safely tell you that rotmgs best days are already gone kabam the owner of the game neglected the game for years the player base was shrinking and many dupinghacking exploits where being used everywhere this could all make one turn away from this game however times are changing a new company called deca games has bought rotmg and is striving to breath new life into it they have already established a connection with the community and have worked long hours to patch the exploits that made the game unplayable for the honest man because of the fact that rotmg seems to be going in a very positive direction i would highly recommend this game
i never thought i would have to say this but tf2 is garbage right now and valve doesnt care theyre more focused to make this like counter strike a competitive ranked based shooter instead of being the casual shooter it was supposed to be valve doesnt care about how the game should be they dont care how the game ends up as long as it makes them a quick buck thats all that matters this
i highly recommend this game to anyone out there looking for something interesting and new i use to want to be a pilot so ive been playing flight sims since i was seven and this game was easy to learn just by doing the tutorials and asking other players certain things
normaly i am ok with pay to play pay to win but this is taking the every animal u see the screen pops up i just wanted to kill like one thing i mean after hours of walking that what anyone would want u do get some free ones but i never found any in my seven hours of play
early access reviewreally love the game but at the moment its the event is really rigged the dungeons bug out often and the low drop rate makes it really hard to farm for the outfits so at the moment i wont recommend until they fixed it
early access reviewfractured space is exaclty what it says in its description you are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weaponsabilities inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek battlestar galactica dreadnought star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these gamesshows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system still in early access so keep in mind some things may change their are a total of twelve ships which have varying unique properties graphics effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update having more local servers would be nice to reduce ping but its quite easy to find a game with each update the game gets better and better overall a great game essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles love to see how this develops the price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future edit updated with more current info
early access reviewit has the feel of hearthstone in terms of graphics the ability to click the arena and the easy visual style the cards are not tiny like some games with the variety of colors of mtg the ai is a little non optimized but i think it will probably get better
what a crap game for new players join game get shot at spawn by snipers wait two minutes to revive before being able to join again unless you pay screw that uninstalled instead
planetside one was a ground breaking mmofps the very first fps to be a true mmo with a one hundred and thirtythree vs one hundred and thirtythree vs one hundred and thirtythree massive fights that spanned air sea for the magriders and land planetside two is not that everything good and unique about ps1 was left out of planetside two there was a frenzy of excitement prior to the launch of ps2 tens of thousands of players were chomping at the bit to get a piece of the action then the infamous shipit fiasco of premature release coupled with an entirely inept dev team led by john smedley the ceo of soe drove it straight into the ground i have seldom been so disappointed in anything i absolutely do not recommend this game the dev team has completely dissolved and soe is grasping at straws to keep this pig afloat because of the ps2 release i am personally boycotting anything soe is involved in
downloaded game excited to try it out and nothing locks up every time and cant get past loading screen running 980tis in sli and supposedly its an slixfire issue fix your sheet people
rarely write reviews but this time i really felt compelled to do so therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably boring short story you should really give this game a true chance without the pregiudice of any review good or bad i am so disappointed to see so many bad reviews from people that have played this game two hours at max and from people that still need to get to finish the story andor get a decent gear this game has potential it is not like every other game out there it gives you a true freetoplay option the ingame shop is just cosmetics and you can get the ingame shop currency just by playing the game dungeon grinds and conversion of points in currencythere is an anticheat now that has killed all the cheaters the ones that are leaving bad reviews i can bet on it youll have open pvp everywhere in contested areas of the huge map there is a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rushing end game and complain that there is no contentpvp and pve is balanced and the pvp is truly that as most games have arena duels and matchaking bs this game has a lot of very well done content but as every game has things that need to be improved it is your choice you can see only the bad things or you can see the good ones too and acknowledge that nothing is as youd wish it to be one hundred the game has performance issues as every mmo game out there the graphics are in range with every other mmo as well now youll need to tweak your own ini file to get the best out of the game graphics it can be annoying i understand that but there are hunderds of guides out there that can help you do it in five min and youll need to go into your nvidia control panel and switch the games vram from integrated to dedicated this game messed up badly at launch this is very true but at the same time the dev team behind this game is not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about the dev team listens to the community and strives to improve this game every day keep in mind that the people playing the game make the community if the cheaters that bought this game want to leave a bad review out of spite i cannot say anything more than to stop reading at the reviews and give this game a true chance it is free now nevertheless ill keep buying my premium membership which doesnt give any p2w advantage to support the devs because this game deserves to be succesful more than bdo owned tes o owned and whatever mmorpg you can think about i have played them all p s even though most people got refunded the purchase of the game they still complain youll have to decide for yourselves whos in bad faith but for as far as i can tell it is not the dev team i am just tired of people donwvoting games that deserve tho shine while upvoting trash games
the dlc karamari hospital is awesomeits tribute to silent hill with a lil resident evil mixed inif your a fan of jump scare mansion and horror genre titles the dlc is definetly for you dev is also active with updates and posts on forum
addicted game unfortunally there isnt an account bound if you buy a companion or mount only a character bound with a lot of astral diamonds you can buy lot of fun stuff the auction house ive bought the dinosaur today with ad the game has fantastic graphics great dreamy environment i like it a lot because i am photographer in real life every detail is a capture the neverwinter battles are exciting my number one game for years keep up the great work neverwinter this game is complete
early access reviewas it is now this game is a chore to play lots of perforamnce issues keep me from playing it for more than fifteen minutes before i get tired of glitching out and being stuck in loading screens ill pick it up again if its fixed and ready to be played properly
i dont hate the game but the game hates me it uses xbox controls and theirs no way to fix it i reinstalled this game three times and nothing has worked when my first dweller came my camera shot up into the corner and went straight back there when i tryed to move the camera to look at the dwellers stats
while this game is very fun the servers are god awful the support is god awful the endless events that just make the servers overloaded are awful losing your hard worked character to some ing lag is absolutly the worst feeling ever especially when it happens twice in a row
creativerse is a dense action packed game that is bound to glue you to your screen i recommed that you get it because it is very fun for those who like the adventure type thing it is minecraft roblox and terraria mixed together with a little spice of its own seriously get it it is freetoplay awesome and all out perfect for all the boys and girls who like the survival type games
early access reviewi loved mtg played for four hundred hours of two thousand and twelve two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fifteen duels i hate hearthstone rng fest and casual mechanics they took what is best of mtg combat fast spells strategy deck building used a great ui and fast paced game flow only thing useful from hearthstone and made this incredible game totally worth the experience i already sum sixty hours in the first two weeks
cant give this game a recommendation with the new spotting system and ground forces russian bias it used to be great now its simply russians with shells that have twice the high explosive filling then other factions stay away go play something else until it gets balanced one day one can only hope
frankly i dont even know why i play this game maybe because i am busy with work and it feels a bit better to have a game you can leave running without checkning at all or even leave it offline feels like playing without playing pros compared to other clickers it has more features catering to playing offline or afk things like big production bonuses to offline play and auto spell casting when youre away it has a lot of unlockable long term you will unlock things weekly for a very long time possibly months or even years depending how much time you put into the game frankly its even too much but thats how these type of games are the concept of playing a being that reincarnates and can control multiple races is kind of interesting and the mathematical optimisation is good exercise for the brain if youre into that kind of minmaxing nerdy stuff cons i would not advise anyone to play this for free the gift of the heroeskingsgods are kind of a must else the restarting process at each abdications which happen every few minutes sometimes becomes way too time consuming even with all the unlockable there is still missing a sens of progression you can play for days without unlocking anything at all which can feel super grindy and often tempting to give up on the game the descriptions are often vague especially for trophies often there are specific conditions to the trophies that are required and not written thus you can waste days trying to get a trophy one way before you realize something is missing through trial and error or asking on the forums the art could have been better its pixelated but much better has been done in this style seeing the time you spend looking at the same screen and art it can be improved greatly and quickly since the art assets are very few and fit on one screen should you get it as i said i dont even know why i am playing it i could give up at any time do i recommend it i dont think so but since its free you can check it out for yourself and forge your own opinion however if you already know that you like clicker games this one is definitely worth checking out
very fun game and after the latest updates the game hasnt been crashing that much sometimes a terrible lagspike but thats rare now for me i have been playing thirty five hours in the last two weeks because ive been enjoying it that much you can better play with some of your friends because if you play all alone youre basically fked negative things are the people in the community theyre shooting you instantly when they see you even though youre unarmed when youre just new to the game and just installed it you might experience some crashes but after many hours of playing it will go away crashing doesnt occur that much anymore so yeah i recommend this game since its fun to play and you can enjoy it for a long time with your friends
seriously try this gameif you like space games light strategy mmoba or anything spaceship related this game is worth your time with a diverse roster of ships seperated into three different manafactuerers and five different classes this game oozes variety ninetynine times out of one hundred there will be a ship perfectly suited to you the tier system is split up into five ship tiers and three matchmaking groups within those tiers giving you the perfect pace and style of play to suit your skill with the game and the strength of your ship progression through these tiers while a bit long is very enjoyable and wont leave you bored to death as you grind to the next tier with the free to play pricetag the only thing youre losing by trying this game is internet quota because i assure you dreadnought is well worth your time
game in general is pretty basic fun way to pass time i made a video showing how to get billions of coain fast for the people who dont want to spend hours clicking https www youtube comwatch vut9dwtr7whe
okay as the player who has 1500hrs with all accounts and non steam i can say that right now the game looks ugly when i came to the game after two months break i expected cool features etc but you made an update for ui which looks ugly af smite was an original game in my opinion and now it looks like paladins or smth put the old ui back or i quit this game forever lol
love this game on my phone but will not work with either my laptop or desktop computers both capable at gaming i spent a little over a week with three different support staff members at bethesda trying the game both through steam and bethesdas own launcher would not connect to their servers with all ports forwarded and firewall exceptions made after my experience on pc i can not recomend on this platform rediculous since it works with no problem on my phone on the same network
just awesome one of the best massive multiplayer games ive ever seen only not so awesome thing is that the newbies always want to steal my galaxies and crush them into the next mountainside in addition i cant fly it anyways
early access reviewi absolutly loved adventure quest worlds so i was exicted when this came out so far im impressed but i feel some time needs to be given for this game to get better but if you dont feel like waiting give this game a try theres lots of stuff to do and even though the level cap is like fifteen or something itll take a while to level also i heard from some friends that theres some different play styles to try out
seven of ten cheating in a match so many cheat in robocraft and fj only cares about profanity they could care less if everyone is cheating but do not leave a match you must finnish gaming with the cheaters half of my friend list used to play this game now one its like crossout but with crazy management that totally changes the game every six months robocraft was the best game i ever played now its a goofy game filled with exploits and cheaters
one of the best games i ever played dont listen to the other dudes you can play it for free and it is still awesome better than minecraft it is even greater if you spend twenty bucks and thatâ s nothing for a great gameplay it you will love it
this is by far one of my alltime favorite games with a wide variety of different gamemodes classes and loadouts you can do so much with this game also community servers provide different gamemodesmods allowing you to choose your preference such as rocket jump maps versus saxton hale surf etc the most enjoyable aspect of this game is that you arent strictly abided to just do the objective of the game half of the time i just goof around with a sandvich in my hand as the heavy while if i wanted to i could also play the game a bit more seriously overall this game never gets old and you can always experience something new each time you play the game
early access reviewoh my god this game is the worst i have no idea how a game like this can make its way on steam do ur self a favor and by cs go and by the way the game runs like dogsh the maps are so blan and boring the game is ugly and its not in a good way like when u play some old n64 game so fu this sh im out
early access reviewmatchmaking system has gotten to the point where games are always one sided the new ranking system for robots has done nothing to balance out teams at least in the old system we knew we would likely face a team with the same number of each weapon type now yeah good luck steer clear of this game
it is not free its basically a demo if you want content you gotta buy it and if you add up all the prices of content it works out at a very expensive game better off buying rfactor two
this program still needs a lot of work for example full screen doesnt work properly makes graphics awful and shifts input so that mouse doesnt select buttons properly managed one training mission in windowed mode in full screeen i was left sitting on the runway unable to do anything as a long time il2 flyer im not impressed
really nice game most detailed weapon game ever i have seen major pros cons detailedmany weapons to choose fromlanguage optionscompleted weapon structureshard to focus on single part of gunautofocus isnt working welloverall pts nine hundred and ten in my opinionyou should try this game if want to expand your knowledge
you cant call game free2play if you have to pay real money to pay for tracks and competitions to play game lags on every crash to the wall on the other hand cars have nice sound and i hope they will be releasing updates and make this game better potencial is real
the fan base is terrible the exp tables are the voice actors are awful the pay to win aspect ruins the game and pvp in general na elsword is terrible id recommend playing on one of the private servers instead
early access reviewpretty good game to play not to long of a download and shooters can go a long way this just makes it plain and simple very good game to pass the time with if you like quick shooters
early access reviewfree weekend download reviewmatches should be filled to playable levels for the next month before dropping to low two hundred player pop so play while you can https steamdb is pretty basic one capture the enemy bases around sectors with titanic space battleships alongside your team2 upgrade your ship over the course of a match3 capture the enemy home base to wincontrols are pretty good once you get hang of moving your shipthe ship themselves feel slow and colossal while moving at least for the starter shipweapon abilities add flare of visual to the chaosupgrade skill tree adds some complexity to shipsgame runs great on u4 enginethe ship models look cool but the environment look blandgameplay is slowpaceworth a spin on the free weekend and introudction to the space battleship games like it but as a game there is much to be desired seeing as this is an early access gamemaps for example if it wasn t for the micro transaction market integrated in the game id recommend buying the game in full however game of similar business models and unlock systems run into balance issues with veteran players and newbies so i can t recommend putting money down sorry devs if the game was fifteen flat and you unlocked everything as you played the game i recommend but the micro transactions just complicate things that don t have to be games like these from my experience are in development for a long time and take forever to release just look at hawken with a similar microtransaction model and release year the game has been liked by 16k players but only has low populations of vets that play and spend money because they already invested heavily into it while no one else is willing to jump into the game thus prolonging development of the title
ive been playing this game for two years now and almost 3love how there is about fifty different characters and the game is very cheap plus you can earn new characters in about thirty four hours without having to buy them plus i love all the funny skins definitley recomend the game to people who are struggling to find a goodfun game for free plus the game has no storyline and a new character is released every two or three weeks so the game is endless fun
simplistic roguelike with suprisingly large open worlds where its easy to find yourself in challening areas the loot in this game is very situational with most drops containing items from other classes which are utterly useless unless you have friends or a group with you but with the large amount of drops its easy to just ignore the useless ones the game is also flooded by spambots advertising a wow pay for gold system which is also easy to ignore for the simplicity and quirkyness its worth the money to buy this game zero is quite a bargain but its great to pick up and play for a few minutes in your spare time
early access reviewthis game hoooorrrible the guns are bad your wasting 10minutes of your life just downloading and playing this game infact just looking at the title is a wast of time
early access reviewthis game is full of hackersvox is a major hacker in this game getting insta kills soon as you log in it seriously lags and has not that many passionate players who rely on skill if you love to hack then this is the game for you25
early access reviewgameplay ninety csgo and ten battlefield no buy menu and adsmenu and style crossfire type fre to play but use micro transaction for extras i would prefer a paid version and call it csgo two

this game has a new ownerdeca games and i really like ityou should really try this game if your interested in rpgmy cons are eight bitmy opinionsome servers are laggy but deca is trying to fix it pros this game is a bullet hell gamemeans that there is a bunch of shots on the map which i really like you can create clans to destroy everythingsadly just that no buffs d fourteen unique made this game awesome againps you get free items if you get in
this review is written during the introduction of the british tank line i played this game during the sale of a package for thirty it includes three months of premium time and crate load of premium currency during three months of premium fast progression through the tech tree but not blazingly fast that skill was inadequate for the next tier battlesmall annoyance like clearly mandatory module was easily obtaincredit flows nicelyable to team up with two players rather than 1after premium mostly ground battleprogression slow down to a crawlin ground battle where repair tools and fire extinguisher is apparently lock behind unlock wall so if you re tracked or on fire during a match you are solduring my play there is an exploit where user can turn down graphic to hide away all the foliage other play that play at high setting like myself is at a disadvantageafter unlocking tier two understand that you will fight against tier three tanks which clearly outclass the previous tier overall game minimap is hard to read for first time it s too complex to read at a glancesome texts do not stand out to alert the player of what is happening to their vehiclesbattle tier arcade is ridiculous how can a stock tank at tier two fight with any competence against a tier 3the grind is real imagine korean mmo grind realall tanks are not made equal so your duel is already decided on who got the jumprng favor first yes rng is a factor in this game where a shell traveling through the tank shattered minor injury only unless youre on the receiving end all hell broke lose addendum the beginning british tank are pathetic turret traverse so slow you wonder if the turret ring is made of granite that the tank crew turn using a wooden crank
ich finde es ziemlich doof weil man kann nur die waffe ankucken und auseinander bauen man kann auch ein paar mal mit der waffe schießen aber es macht keinen spaß
its a clickeridle game but its pretty addictive there are a tonne of upgrades to unlock and each faction has its own spin on them unfortunately the game lacks any music but rest assured the soothing sound of frantic mouse clicks will keep you company the background map is pretty basic and changes only occur when you unlock a new building or change faction the menuicons are fairly well done though and at the end of the day youre probably going to leave it idle ninety of the time to rack up money realm grinder is a free game but tucked away inside are a bunch of microtransations these arent forced or intrusive so im fairly neutral on their existance for the sake of transparency the microtransactions cover things like increasing clickbuilding rate puchasing rubies increase production converting your gems increase percentage without resetting your progress and fastforwarding the game overall if you like clickeridle games then youll probably love this if youre looking for something with a bit more depth or story then look elsewhere
dirty wolf is a talented developer and being a ccg genre fan i mainly played their second game eternal though after studying eternal deeper i ve found out that its large seventyfive cards deck and mana screwflood problem basically turn it to a coin flip simulator when i tried es legends i immediately saw that it improved several magic concepts including mana and rng issues i was a bit concerned about recent changes to the game but looks like they ve just changed the client and the technical problems are being solved by the regular patches so since the core of the game wasn t touched i definitely recommend it as one of the best digital card games on a market
one of the largest and by far the most versatile of the mmorpgs on the market since having left everquest for everquest ii this has been my home that always calls me back from my visits to other games
"i wish i could say that i enjoy this game i really do but the games devolved the only way you can get enjoyment out of this is if you grind for hours and hours and hours and hours or just spend twenty two thousand, four hundred and sixty one on bs dlc because we re obviously willing to spend that much on a game like this and be proud of it the game got bland and boring for me after a while its just the same old dungeons reskinned to look different if you talked to me about a year ago i wouldve said yeah try it but if you talk to me nowadays ill say hell no stay away from that godforsaken grindfest that is trove"
insanely addicting game may get frustrating at time as you die over and over and over again but it is worth it and there are perks to dying as you get fame to use in game also the pets system is amazing you can level your pets up completely with in game currency but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet it is definitely easier for paying users overall great game its free so why not try it
early access reviewits a good game but it has alot of issues mostly with balance get it if you like world of tanks because thats all you will get form it every battle tanks vs infantry
early access reviewpros freeless buggy than pubg and its more stablegame dynamics are greatcons ran up a 90â hill no problemminor bugs here and there but there is always room for improvement
its a neat basemanagement mobile game come to steam not much else to it first and foremost if youre planning on playing this fullscreen you might want to look elsewhere this game is incredibly slowpaced play it windowed off to the side while you watch youtube videos or the news or wait for a real game to install it is a mobile game and plays as such you build your very own vault and micromanage the residents within you construct rooms send brave souls out into the wasteland to scavenge for materials fight fires manage your three main resource pools fight off raider attacks for a mobile game let alone a free mobile game its quite something its obviously marketed to fallout fans but i dont think theres any reason a newcomer to the franchise would be scared off i really like it ive actually got about forty hours in it before steam picked it up and havent paid a cent you can buy speedup items if youre a small impatient child with unsupervised access to your moms credit card but otherwise its just not worth it its free and surprisingly comprehensive for a mobile game give it a shot
friend payed realworld money to cheat and become x10 better than everyone in this game the one with the more money is the winner a quote from him its not my fault that i have money and others dontcapitalism jpg
i spent fifteen hours out of the two hour playtime to just get past the title splash screen fps poor optimization terrible localization frequent disconnections the bugs and glitches are endless tried really hard to give it a fair play and i get that its an early access but hey its gotta be playable at the very least take my advice dont buy this and just refund if youve made the mistake edit the servers are being shut down one after the other in different regions should be enough justification
team fortress two first started as a team based shooter now a heaven for hat trades even though the game looks nothing like it was more than a decade ago it still feels similar the game is good the game is free and its not paytowin it doesnt hurt to try
"early access reviewdont play this game seriously the game has a great idea path progression faction based fighting awesome ideas perfect until you actually play the game horrible hit detection ballistics like shooting tenis balls and at least one hacker per match also snipers snipers everywhere and why not the game rewards you to be a sniper the longer range a kill the higher the exp with an average weapon you get five maybe six exp for a kill ten if savior meaning you stoped them from killing a buddy sixty if defensive meaning inside a cap point average sniper kill at 200m seven thousand, five hundred and eighty not adding defensive or savior so you can imagine everymatch has at least half the teams made of snipers also very pay to win the bought mgs and sub mgs can almost snipe themselves and the basic rifle has to be almost point blank to hit that is of course the hit detection lets you laggy as all hell ping is a very big problem buggy just overall a poorly done gamecould be an awesome game if done right but its not and sadly this games ideas are almost exactly what i think an awesome ww2 shooter would be but i end up raging ninety of the timeif you want to try it and at least pretend like you found the ww2 shooter your looking for go for it but for god sakes dont give them any money"
when i heared last year there was gonna be a card game for elder scrolls i thought it was gonna be lame but then six months ago i decided to download it and play it and figure ill give it a chance i was really suprised about how good it was and i never liked hearthstone but this game surprised me i think its a better version of heathstone for everyone who asks if its p2w or not i have been playing for a long time now and ill tell you right now it is not you can get a lot of good cards in the game without paying a only thing you will pay for is stories or if you dont have patience and want shortcuts you can buy card packs and see if you get lucky
"full voice acting equipped items show dramatic game changing classes hard to play alone no tutorial good plotstory okay combat amazing graphics great gameplay doesnt require a powerful computer total pointage seven thousand, five hundred and ninety five my opinion nine hundred and ninety five"
what couldve possibly been the greatest online game of the decade is being actively ruined by a company that both has no idea what theyre doing and doesnt give a anymore i want to recommend this game to you its one of my alltime favorites ive met countless friends and competing in smite has genuinely made me develop as a person and shaped me into who i am today the game at its core is unbelievably fun but hirez doesnt ing care and so neither should you dont waste your time im so ing upset man
once installed i decided it was not for me so i uninstalled it via steam but this game is like the worst malware ever it didn t uninstall i can t uninstall from the add and remove programs there is also no uninstall exe in the games folder very poor show
early access reviewwell had fun not trying to get this to work still trying to get it to uninstall from my computerlooks a good game and managed to get three games of it yesterday but today after many attemps to get this game working i have decided it isnt worth spending over forty mins trying tooand still cant even get it to uninstall oh well back to pubg
early access reviewi played fortnite much fortnite before a month i already decided to drop the game since the devlopers care more for the mass of players and dont implant a good competetive mode or something anyways here im back on a royale again the game feels pretty good even though the animations are a bit cringy dev you provided with smite already that it can goes way better the gunplay is really nice shots are hitting the abilitys give some fresh air and are fun to use and play against the map is well designed so its a really good game a big point is no solo mode why why tf should you bring out a br game without solo why do i have to learn the game by fighting 1v2 thats really stupid and i see no point why there isnt allready a solo mode the ranking system is ok but senseless right now and then every class use the same character model yes you can say its alpha but this are some things made pretty fast lets look if the community will stay and hope updates come quick then it could be my new main game edit solo patch out now forget thattrue the jump animation looks like a stick in theâ â â â
even after three thousand hours with a few crappy updates and a few updates that after a little work became great i still cant leave this game alone love this game to much to just drop it and let it die with a few bad updates
i first started playing robocraft way back when the game was in alpha my older brother showed me the game and i really enjoyed when it rolled over to stream i played the hell out of it but when they removed tiers and added ranks and the whole crate system i stopped playing the game because i hated the way they changed it i missed the old robocraft im leaving this review because they are finally making the game good again bringing back tiers and removing crates bringing back the old tech tree system i believe that with this update people might be able to play the good version of robocraft again so if your looking into this game since its free just try to take a look at it its an amazing game have a fantastic day
there is so many things wrong with this game cant look down while running everyone is a when you die you get kicked from the game and have to wait four mins for your character to recover i have been kicked from games for no reason such a pay to win that was all the stuff i had a problem with but thats me this game might get better might
it doesnt really run that well on my computer but massive persistent open world battles are pretty much my favorite thing in a multiplayer game and this game is basically the best one if you want to experience that plus this game has a pretty good f2p model so just give it a whirl
spent so much time and money in to this game and lord its worth getting and buyingif first time something from the mann co storei suggest a mann co key doesnt matter what kind i still remember my first time with tf2 i didnt understand it much about it but now its my most played steam game ten octillion and ten for team fortess two
i tried to like it looked on reviews and gameplays but getting stomped from players that startet earlier in ranked games not cool needs a fix in rank system3 cards to destroy permanents ongoing effekts where one is violet one violetyellow and one uncolored is unbalanced needs an fix for the ongoing systemstarting second is a too big bonus getting three extra mana ist heavy rebalance this please its just no fun do try getting your dailies done do grow up when the wording is confusing and sometimes dont count because of this misunderstanding of wording sorry for the rant but neebies getting stomped to much and the only way to get a way around is too much money infest
early access reviewthis is a very unique and great game the reason i love it is it scares me so badly and yet i am determined to finish it what this game does is it sets you in a false sense of security makes you feel like one room is safe and okay and then when you go to the next room it rips you to pieces with its terrifying jumpscares from the monsters i hate you weeping angel puppet master you scare me to bits but its awesome to the cute little jumpscares this game has it all if you enjoy horror and things that can really set you in the right mood to want to scream then check this game out i dont recommend it to people who are susceptible to heart attacks because this game could cause one if you dont take a break every now and then but other than that this game is awesome and i love it cant wait for it to be finished fully three
not an fps fan never mind the mmo aspects of this but it brought me in from starting simple doing basic medengineer support to getting the kit needed to mix it in a huge variety od scenarios fom lone combat to tactical squad devastation via vehicular devastation to creating and holding strategic places always a wide range of open platoons to join ad hoc if youre looking for squad engagements and outfits to join if youre looking to get deeper into training and stategy or just sod it and spend a few hours as a rampaging max or a lone sniper ive never played fifty hours on any game up until this and somehow ive managed to showhorn five hundred hrs into my life im amazed but that is how engrossing the is a great starting point for anyone new to the multiplayed aspects of fpses or games in general do it and choose vanu sovereignty of course coolest combatants with ther coolest tech
team fortress two where do i even begin the trading the gameplay the hats the classestheres the scout the soldier the pyro the demoman the heavy the engineer the medic the sniper and the spy they all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily nearly kill you or just annoy you to death the scout is the fastest class with his scatterguns pistols and his bats and he is also able to doublejump in the air the soldier wields a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel and is the secondslowest class the pyro wields a flamethrower a shotgun and a fire axe and is a mysterious person whose gender is still unknown the demoman wields a grenade launcher stickybomb launcher and a bottle and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking the heavy wields a minigun a shotgun and since he is oh so manly his bare fists and he is also the slowest class the engineer has a shotgun a pistol and a wrench he is able to build sentry guns dispensers and teleporters to help attack the enemy team and support his team the medic wields a syringe gun a medigun and a bonesaw hes a medical expert and his mediguns can heal the team and ubercharge them which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time the sniper wields a sniper rifle no surprise there an smg submachine gun and a kukri a big knife thingy hes australian hes got his sights on you and youre his next target finally we have the spy french elegant sneaky a ladykiller metaphorically and a literal mankiller he has his revolver his knife and his sapper which he can use to destroy the engineers buildings his knife can kill any enemy in the game with a backstab do i need to explain what a backstab is unless they are ubercharged or if a sniper is wearing the razorback which blocks backstabsnote these are just stock weapons there are tons of different weapons for you to try out mix and match babythe gameplayteam fortress two is often times a very fun competitive game where you can snipe stab shoot or stun through different weapons and different classes talked about above there are often two groups of tf2 the p2ps pay to plays and f2ps free to plays p2ps are often known for having many cosmetics valuable weapons and skill while f2ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking youre a spy my personal experience is that most f2ps i meet are actually quite good players with many maps many gamemodes and many players youre bound to have a good time why not try some cppowerhouse or maybe ctfdoublecross perhaps plbananabay what is competitive matchmaking competitive matchmaking means that youre put in a server with other players as good as you like in counterstrike global offensive this was much requested by the community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players or players much much better than you prayers were answered in the gun mettle update with the introduction of fortress two is sadly being slowly updated but these new updates often come in with the big guns some of the more recent updates as of january 1st twenty eighteens are the smissmas twenty seventeens update and jungle inferno update there are also other major game updates from the past especially the uber update love and war update and the mann vs machine update many of these updates often have a source filmmaker sfm video to introduce these updates and their features such as the meet the medic video for the uber update the expiration date video for the love and war update and the leaked invasion video for the invasion update some updates instead get a comic such as the gun mettle update some of these events only last for a period of time and arent permanentwhat do these updates introduce some of these updates in particular ones like the love war and uber updates introduce bulk amounts of new items like cosmetics weapons and other items like paint for your hats and unusual effects to look good in up until the jungle inferno update no new weapons had been added since the tough break updated in 2015thanks for reading my review three
dota two is completely free to play all heroes are available to everyone at all times and the experience you gain at an account level only serves to unlock ranked play skills vary wildly from player to player but the playing field they meet on is largely level regardless of how many hours or how much money theyve put into the game
the game has such an updown style of competence so i would rate somewhere in the middle but as there are only two options im going to choose no it can be immensely fun and if made by any company rather than gaijin it could be a very good game but with the direction theyre heading im not getting a fuzzy warm feeling on the good side it can be amazing fun with three different game styles with varying realism and tons of different ww2 aircraft to choose from after a few hundred hours however the downsides of the game really showthe balancing in wt is usually questionable to downright bad especially at higer tiers where german and japanese ww2 props see postwar american jetsrussian bias no but definitely some extensive support for the russians from devs where we get another yak to add to the pile of 20no options to opt out of gamemodes like the new and awful air domination which is one big cluster you dont want to be a part of also odd alternate history matches that really should be able to be deselected this review is just for the airplanes by the way ground forces is so terrible at the moment i dont even want to mention it
"amazing game but you have to buy a subscription every three thousand, six hundred and twelve months thats the only bad part and its really bad id gladly pay five thousand and sixty for the game once and only once this is the only reason i dont play it more"
this game is more addictive than drugs d but at beggining matchmaking are super unbalanced you cant see opponents darts if opponent disconnect in lobby you have to wait until opponent again connect or you will lose medails nobody want to wait twenty minutes so you will lose medails in both cases i love it although this problems and ill poop ballons again
the servers never work infestation
i played until level 40ish and i can say that this game is extremely pay two win at higher level it is almost impossible to get any decent gear without investig a ton of time or money professios require quite a lot of time which people with a life dont have it keeps the player tied to the game missions are repetitieve and lack any originality and soon after the level thirty even weak mobs will be able kill you pvp is poorly balanced and you will most likely get matched with some overpowered players who paid for their gear overall the game requires a lot of time from the player oferring very little in exchange unless you have a lot of money to spare for this game you will unlikely enjoy this game
havent enjoyed seven hundred at all playing a support feels terrible now with the changes to visibility and the maze of treesstairs everywhere trying to ward is just a nightmare it feels like as soon as one team starts getting ahead it just snowballs with the new talent system before seven hundred dota was the only game i played but cant see myself continuing its basically a completely different game
team fortress two is an amazing game this is the best game ive seen good setting good gameplay and mechanic team fortress two lasts for ten years or even more i play this game for laugh fun and mistake this game is unique nine classes hundreds of weapons i recommended it one of my most precious game ive ever played
a game that will not only get you addicted to hats but also hyped up about breadthe goal in this firstperson shooter multiplayer video game is to choose a team redblu and beat the other team in eight different official game modes king of the hill capturetheflag pushlittlecart inside a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weaknesses which guarantees there ll be a game style that fits you you can also play coop where you team up with six other people to kill robots who came to attack the mann co store besides these official game types there are many others created by the community such as a medieval prophunt if you ever get bored with playing which is unlikely but it can happen after more than two thousand hours you can always start collecting hats by trading reason why it s often referred to as the number one hatsimulator before this game i wouldn t even have considered playing any cartoonlike games but i m glad someone converted me it s a game thats filled with humor and will not get you bored easily more importantly it s free why shouldn t you give it a try at least but the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends and for the people who dont have any friends with this game youll sure get someeven if this game has been out there for a while it s still being updated on a regular basis new game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at halloween christmas and easter there is only one downside i can think of it s quite large in size so make sure you have enough disk space
product received for freeearly access reviewthis game was really interesting at the start but all the new things ruin it u could only use one weapon type and hat to aim at the beginning nowadays u can have different weapon types which means u can have a invincible robot cause u have anti ground and anti air cannons also alot of the weapons are lock on now which also renders aircrafts rather useless especially the more fragile ones this game had alot of potential sadly its just a casual shooter nowadays i cant recommend u getting it
early access reviewthis is probably the best free to play card game out right now its a shame its not as popular as moneystone pros good mechanicsa free system that lets you get gold and cards with ease with the grinding being challenging but doable depthhigh level of strategy an arena game mode that lets you keep all the cards you picked and gives you gold and packs if you win a bunch of games ranked rewards cosmetics good dev or dev team cons minor connection issues might be just megames feel a little slow and sometimes drag out for a long time im talking forty mins to an hour not for casuals sigils and the long tutrorial
this game is absolutely fantastic been playing since closed beta and the devs have actively been balancing the game with frequent patches new cards every month an absolutely fantastic story expansion with wonderful voice acting and difficult challenges and all on top of very deep gameplay that in my opinion yes is superior to hearthstone having played hs for two years and esl since closed beta many months ago this is the game i can recommend more highly than any other in my steam library
fun hack and slash with a lot of variety it can scratch that itch to run and jump around and smash things just dont get too invested in it or youll get frustrated by how much you can buy your way to victory with your credit card but its very much enjoyable without all that especially if you only play with friends so that you dont have to compare yourself with people whove dropped a bunch of
early access reviewhey if you guys could fix that bug where you randomly stop communicating with the server and your input means nothing until you restart the entire game and reconnect thatd be swell and this game might actually be playable other than the fact the game doesnt want to be played its fine not great but fine
early access reviewthis game was one of those games i never tought it would grasp me so tight i was really amazed of it i have bought the pro feature after few hours of gameplay and i must say every cent worth it i have also brought my friends in this beautiful universe and we are all having fun in it the wiring system is very interesting and it is a thing that appeals even to grownups you really can do a lot of things you can let your imagination and thinking romp you can have a pleasant and chill time spiced a little bit by the adventure and fighting definitely would continue to play just give it a try
early access reviewvery addictive and visually stunning game to play racing form sector to sector to conquer gives the game a sense of urgency and does not get boring what so ever only complaint is the matchmaking system spent over twelve hour trying to connect join game only to be gutted when the dreaded game aborted poppedup everytime not having the option to stop the dreaded matchmacking loop i had to cntrl alt delete out of the game to stop this evertime other than that this game is on to sometihng and having fully enjoyed my time spent playing this game is on my radar of games to get for sure
early access reviewi really love adventure quest 3d i have grown up playing artix entertainments games mainly adventure quest dragon fable mech quest and adventure quest 3d which i realise might make me a bit bias pros it can be played cross platform on pc mac android apple ios phones tablets a feature planned for the future allows you to combine the appearance of one piece of equipment to the stats of another it will constantly be updated by the aq3d team meaning it will have new things to do often the graphics are in the same style for adventure quest games and can be run on most computers it is a fun game and there are funny moments at least for me cons leveling up at high levels takes a lot of time and experience which can result in you getting to higher level areas while still being a lower level the game is still in the beta stage so it has more things to be before it can be extremely good and will have some bugs here and there overall i think it is a great game that will only keep getting better as time passes especially once it leaves the beta stage
never winter appears to be a good entry level mmorpg for those who want to dip their toes into the dark dangerous waters i found the entry lvl zone full of people and couldnt find my display filters fast enough so many people selling end lvl gear and lfg shouts it could appear overwhelming for a first timer right click on the chat window and uncheck most of the options except tell whisper group
early access reviewi recommend installing the few mbs this game has just so you can see how rubbish it is seriously you dont need to look for much longer than five seconds to figure out this game is so bad that i am actually concerned for the people who leave positive reviews after playing more than five hours of this
early access reviewthis game is awesome especially if youre a big fan of the aq games works pretty well lots of planned content and the graphics look really nice on max and it runs so easily
a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make dota two a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas mobas such as league of legend and dota one of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero mirana and her trademark wbutton ability sacred arrow which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal notulti moves in the game when not utilising this 360damage 5second stun players may take solace in miranas other special abilities such as leap a devastatingly evasive jump starstorm a powerful aoe magical damage dealer and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on miranas team invisible at the click of a button whilst dota two does not necessarily revolve around the everpopular hero mirana at this time many hope to one day see her in an online actionadventure of her very own
so here we are again out in the wilderness days gone by and your hard throbbing member has yet to be planted into some raw juicy rear you sit out in your scrawny little watch tower when suddenlybluarghthats it all youve been waiting for that one handsome and musculant call from the woods you take out your deer homo callerâ and let out one equally as homoerotic call hoping that itll react to it you patiently wait out those painstaking minutes which feel like hours you look through your binoculars and you see something something in the bush that isnt quite right its the antlers those big pointy and majestic antlers piercing through the foilage your nerves are going haywire your breathing is out of control but you manage to keep your binoculars steady as you focus on the beast it breaks through the foilage there is is muscular sweaty and musky stag just waiting to be plugged you stow your binoculars away as you approach the galiant beast every step you take towards it makes your heart beat faster and faster you can see it you can smell it you can feel it and there it is right in front of you just a stone toss away youre ready youve prepared your whole life for this your senses are going through the roof you reach into your pants unbuckle the strap whop out your throbbing and wellgreased gun you clear your mind slow down your breathing and take aim bangeverything quiets down there you are right on top of it you stroke your hand over the fur and gently carass the antlers after filling it up with your munition and just as youre about to pull out a mysterious man walks out of the woods and looks you straight in the eyesit has come to my attention that youve been dropping whitetail deer with unpermitted ammoto hell with you doc
if you are looking for a solid game to sink countless hours into this is a great game otherwise maybe not so much it has an incredibly steep learning curve even for a moba but it is satisfying to master the community isnt the best but its not the worst either all in all its a good game after the first one hundred or so hours but its gonna be pretty frustrating until then
early access reviewbefore anyone says oh its in early access you shouldnt judge it so harshly early access isnt armour for criticism plus im sure the people at artix have their big boy pants on and can take a crticism or two firstly why am i playing an androidios mmo on my pc at this point artix should have the money to make a decent 3d mmo at least on the level and scale of world of warcraft or guild wars two they may not be good examples but the point still standsso why are they making an mmo for mobile devices granted its a lucrative market at this point but why then release it on pc they could have just released it on the play store and itunes released updates and just have it make money where it should secondly why does the game look terrible like it looks worse than runescape and thats saying somethingi ask that question but then i remember they are making a mobile game for the pc its not stylised in a way that would hold up either it just generally looks bad like ps1 early days of polygon sprites bad finally and this can be pointed to it being in early access but there are lots of other early access games that passed this hurdle the gameplay is completely uninspired and pointless you have a total of five skills for each class and one of them is always the auto attack there is no variation to it and overall it leaves me bored im not expecting it to make any big waves but even the original aq holds up better than this in conclusion its a boring ugly lame excuse for a pc port of what has been done several times over a hundered times better on mobile devices
can only shoot two types of animal need to shoot other type of animals even using to unlock still need to renew license when the license expired need real to shoot pixel animal move along nothing to see here
early access reviewconnecting to server is like ing waiting for whole day damn it cant play this game i played aq in my childhood now you ruined it but still its on beta so get you together artix
early access reviewall around amazing the game can be run on a potato pc just like mine and futhermore it has more features than any other battle royal this game allows the player to chose a class and that fits their own personal style the game does have its issues however as this is an alpha product all i can say is well done hirez if you struggle to run fortnite and fancy changing things up then give realm royale a chance if you like it then you like it and as of now it isnt filled with microtransactions so there are no features that allow players to have a higher advantage just because they paid for it lastly the controls arent hard to use they are simple easy and fine the controller support is only partial but that still doesnt mean you cant plug in your controller and give it a go youd be surprised at this game if you gave it a chance
early access reviewfractured space is the space game everyone wants needs and if they are smart has although very early in development it is extremely beautiful fun action packed but doesnt have the ability to link friends in games together which needs to be done in the next update if they want to keep players but in general its a fantastic game all of us gamers we have been waiting for
early access review this game about half a year ago i loved this game but since then it has been updated and it has been ruined one the developers has changed the maximum hp well in theory this can be a good idea it has ruined the game you die in an instant you can get oneshot with one of the base rifles in the torso you have under half the maximum hp as before you get killed no matter what under a second i am not joking two there is no main menu you can either quit the game completely or log out only to to be stuck in the loadout section without the ability change loadout or customize character because the game thinks your in a match three no more casual domination it s been removed you can no longer enter matches with low rank players without there being tanks planes or overpowered weapons you die you just die four fps is when i played the game when it was good it had proper fps but now it s this game has been ruined what happened
no just no its pay to win could have been different but it doesnt work out sadly i was pumped for this game but in the end it was a disappointment and was hugely pay to win and the quests were bland the only good thing is that the community can make their own levels which are better than the actual games levels neverwinter is not a good game and i dont recommend it
i didnt really like the game when i first played it but it grew on me now im really enjoying it i dont really understand why the reviews are mixed im usually pretty harsh on games but this one gets a recommendation from me its free to play so what do you have to lose besides your time
early access reviewyou were the chosen one this was a unique fun take on the battle royale genre the class system the forges the chickens somehow theyve managed to make the game worse with every update six man squads arbitrary weapon slots every other patch completely reworking the forge system players dont drop their gear anymore this game just needed more content and some minor reworks for balancing only hope i could see is to reset to an earlier version and restart the early access process
i only have about two sentences why you shouldent play this the publisher kabam ruined it its complete pay to win this game used to kick kabam just really wants money and nothing else screw you kabam
this is a game that needs time to learn time to learn how to keybind time to learn how to start up an aircraft time to learn how to target enemies time to learn how to destroy them time to learn how to use countermeasures time to learn how to land then once you know those you need time to learn how to fly at night with night vision goggles on some aircraft you can be happy with the game without the need of a flightstick ir or pedals they do add more to the enjoyment but if you can only use a controller this game still works with you if you dont like learning how planes helicopters work i dont recommend this for you if you take the time to learn it you will be rewarded with explosions and burning carcasses that were once your enemies take the time to learn the free su25t and you will see how fun it is to kill ground targets that is just a taste of how fun dcs can be
well its still bad it looks exactly the same as it did before weapons are easier to find so you might actually have some fun playing with friends but nothing seems to have changed from the original war z well theyve implemented an anti duping system that makes it so that you cant pick up items dropped by someone that youve killed also the servers suck i got killed and couldnt join a single server had to restart the game and it still kept saying that i had an open session eventually i got back in but got dcd and game crashed p s a new developer fredaikis are you sure its not just the same guys but a new company
i swear this game is the best game that has happened all year i was reluctant to buy the dlc at first but i ended up getting it and it changed my life you do not know what youre missing until you play this game with the dlc one hundred ten three
the card game everyone loves even when you get a brick hand welcome to steam duel links no more having to kill my phone battery to hoursonend grinding up the ladder in ranked now if i could just get that damn ur i need out of the box for real though this is a really good mobile port and they made great use of the space available this game is quite addictive and i recommend it to any yugioh fan on steam you can buy packs with real cash if you very well wish to however it is completely optional and its very easy to acquire the ingame currency to buy said packs without putting any money into this game
when i first started playing in the beginner maps the game was fairly entertaining trying to build up a worthy character by finding rare weapons sniper rifles and upping the skill tree most other players were in the same boat i was in and were just trying to grind out sessions to make a better character with a handful of hackers everyone does shoot on site though because of the hackers even was shot by a player i gave a gun to with the gun i had just gave himher lesson learned trust no one then unfortunately i leveled up to where i was only allowed on the normal maps now ive been one shot killed by assault rifles with heavy armor on numerous times shot a guy at point blank with a lmg but still getting killed while the other player somehow still had one hundred health my point being if you get to the nonbeginner maps they are loaded with hackers and if you dont run into hackers teams thatll just maul any loner they find no longer even remotely worth my time anymore the devs seriously need to do a fix to reduce hacking and maybe put teams and single players on different servers i really do have high hopes for this game but until its fixed i cant recommend it
good game if you like creating with boxes there is some combat involved but depending the settings of the world youre in it can be minimal and easy which is not necessarily a bad thing you can easily play this without spending any real money but if you like it i imagine youll probably get to the point where you want to spend a little its better to do that early in your experience with this game since youll get more for your money earlyon even if you wait or never spend any of your hardearned funds this is still a good game for its genre and worth playing
awful physics and expensive content shame as i loved seven but simbin have nosedived with this if you can spend the money go with iracing if not try assetto corsa sp actually get both and save yourself the download on this high end sim physics well they may seem good if you have never driven a car only positives i can find is the sound is pretty good gfx passable as long as you dont use triple screens and it is free to try so i didnt waste any money on it
early access reviewnot played a great deal to be honest the game seems pretty good i like the mechanics and the combat system biggest issue really is the wait times ten minutes between games is just not acceptable and i can much easily play another moba game that doesnt make me wait as long between matches i cant blame the game for that its obviously a small playerbase but due to this its kind of an endless loop no players long wait times less players longer wait times
product received for freeearly access reviewmy friends and i started playing about two months before the update was just getting into it then they broke it now there is no more tiers and you get killed instantly by a dude with nine shotguns dont play this game till its fixed you have been warned
honestly i see all these bad reviews and i cant help but look back on my days playing nw before it hit steam was very fun until the devs saw a chance to make cash off players then i quit it used to be fun pathofexile mixed with wow was very nice graphics and super fun dungeon gameplay but i cant blame devs theyneed to keep the reputation of f2p mmos alive money grabbing
ive played this game for approximetly one year now and i have to say it is much better than the original warz it doesnt have hackers which was the major problem in the original game the loot is much better and it is significantly less p2w i mean you are not paying any money to get the game and its only an option to buy premium you can still gather a large global inventory and get good weapons from playing on normal servers everything apart from certain skins you can farm normally without paying for premium the loot in this game is not scarce like the original the instant revieve character respawn for premium doesnt effect too much due to you having a total of five characters you can use two characters to pvp i think people are not giving this game the chance it deserves people are literally bandwagoning hate on this game due to it not being successful in the past isnt that what this game is an improvement from the original the final thing i would like to put out there is that the developers actually care about the community feedback unlike the developers of the original installment whilst having great support
early access reviewa nice attempt to create a proper tcg yet fails with bad design choices that enforce rng even more than needed mechanic wise i prefer the game over its competitors like hearth stone but a major issue that i have with this game is the way they designed the resource system why in the world would you want to have your resources in form of cards in your actual deck that poorly crafted design increases the rng that tcgs have to deal with even more than required cause not only do you have to make sure to draw the right cards you also have to make sure now to not draw resources if not needed and vice versa could be an amazing tcg but fails due to a very stupidly designed fundamental mechanic
incredibly simple and easy to get into this is a game you can play for ten minutes and get plenty done dont let permadeath scare you it ends up feeling more like an arcade game than a traditional mmo in that regard the time between starting the game and understanding whats going on is minutes long also its free and is twenty mb get it and try it
played on arc downloader not steam downloader steam downloader was giving me problems of not downloading all the files updatesthis has not been updated to the new module four nerf the game is a lot more even now but im to lazy to completely edit reviewmodule five fixed a lot of awesome stuff games good but it get repetitive and really no good end game goal still fun game tho still to lazy just try the game i guess if u wanti know it says do not recommend but this game has an incredible story line its really good its a decent game except the game is all about which class you pick its not how long you spend playing the game its not exactly pay to win but paying can give you a big big boost giving you a big advantage against other players definetly big advantage the game is not really that great for me i mean i choose the class trickster rogue worst class ever i dont even know why there is a class like this i wanted to role play or feel like a rogueassassinninja squish but massive damage that piles damage quick and is a fast class i was completely way way way way off the class is more of the squish looks like a ninjaassassinrogue that does above average damage with two second stealth and is a very slow moving character the tank class actually moves faster then the rogue class runs faster moves faster damages faster piles faster and isnt squishy the ranger class moves faster piles damage faster has aeo effs doesnt hit higher but is way way faster when attacking which is stupid because a rogue is suppose to again pile damage fast and hit fast and hit hard which heshe does not so summary the game has a good story line terrible just aweful cant emphasize this enough design of how the classes are so broken they make no sense tanks are fast with high def and fast attack rangers fast attack fast movement high def magers average movement average attack speed high damage output high def rogue class low def average movement speed a little bit above attack speed a little bit above average damage ouput this game is designed poorly on classes but incredibly on story you cant immerse yourself into it its just not that good
no recomiendo este juego por las siguientes razones aunque el juego fue muy interesante y atrapante al principio poco a poco se ha convertido en un juego pay2win descaradísimo he estado jugando durante casi three hundred horas y me encuentro jugando contra personas que me acaban de ganar debido a que sus cartas eran simplemente mejores que las mías y estaban jdidamente op si quiero poder tener una oportunidad contra las personas que pagaron tengo que pasar aún más horas más de three hundred horas tan ridiculo como sin sentido ah por cierto algunas de estas cartas no las puedes conseguir a menos que pagues da igual las horas que eches el modo historia si es muy entretenido pero básicamente ahora mismo el juego está en este punto puedes jugar gratis pero o te dejas los dineros en cartas o mucho tiempo llevo three hundred horas hace unos meses llegaba al leyenda y ahora ni de pta coña en serio o bien resignate a que te van a pegar muuuuchas palizas hasta que tengas una baraja decente supongo que la estrategia de las recompensas por conectarte etc es para que no pierdas la esperanza de que realmente puedes llegar a tener una buena baraja y jugar en igualdad de condiciones sin tener que pagar para poder conseguir enganchar a la gente en resumen el juego en sí mismo es bueno pero cuando juegas contra personas que pagan para ganar no importa cuán bueno seas sin importar tus habilidades vas a perder muchas vecesi do not recommend this game because of the following reasons although the game was very interesting and catching at the beginning little by little has become in a pay2win game i have been playing for almost three hundred hours and even though i find myself playing against people who have just won me because of their cards were just better than mine and fing overpowered if i want to be able to have a chance against people who paid do i have to spend even more hours more than three hundred hours as ridiculous as nonsense in summary the game itself is good but just as far as you play against people who do not just pay to win no matter how good you are no matter your skills
amd ryzen sixteen hundreds 32ghz i run this game with this hardwaregeforce gtx 106016gb ramgame looks beautyful although someparts may look outdated it doesn take away from the mmo shooter expbest stopping points are when you win a battle dominated an area2nd time installing and ive gotten over the hard parts of this game yes you are gonna die a lot but that is because you are a noobnew player like any other game you need to learn the ropes best feeling i get from this game is when i run infiltraitor and do a hard flank and kill three or four guys it feels good because at most of the times i am surrounded by the enemy which is insta death if you are not inf
fun play complex and control your creatures or use auto in pvp on auto lol so fun casual af i stretch and yoga during matches and win cuz i have the legendary wizard guy and thumper i downloaded and never played for a long time i logged back in and had 4k blue gems i got thumper pack and got legendary wizard guy and rudolf totally free you can win1 play competitive2 play casual auto in pvpvery fun
some technical issues and banned my child from using it world of tanks asked me to follow some steps but didnt work dissapointing for a kid to play and suddenly ban stay away from this game
alright ladies and gentlemen time you tell you a decently okay story review of realm of the mad god now before we begin i would just like to say somethings this game is permadeath but you can keep some of your items if they are in your vault dont be decieved by my measly thirty play hours i probably had 10x this amount before i started playing through steam and not the rotmg website prosvery entertainingsimple learning curve if your new to the genrefun community and you make friends quite easilycontrols are simple yet perfecthigh replay valuemany different classes to choose from with there own unique items and skillsyou get to run in hordes of players you dont even know exploring a dungeon and i mean tons of peopletheres a server specifically for tradingfun playing solo or with friendsdepending on how you view it very rewarding but also very punishing permadeathextremely fun boss fights i mean legit your fighting a giant ing puppet thats like hella op with you fifty people and the fight still takes a couple minutesconsmoney all they want is your money basically your bombarded with ads and deals everytime you open the game also the hub is legit full of items to buy but cost like one hundred and fifteen even though you can easily with the right tools earn them ingame dont worry you dont need to buy these items at allspend money in general but one thing id recommend buying if you enjoy the game is the new player starter pack to sum it up new players have seven days one week to buy this starter pack or you wont get the offer ever again its definitely worth getting it its twenty but if you were to buy all the itemsvault chestscoins each it would cost you around eighty so its worth a buy the game was abandoned the developers do not update the game anymore so no new content will be added to the game scammers but wait you just said rotmg had a great commu shut up i know what i said and it really does have a great community but everyday more and more scammers come to the game so it gets a little hard to trade with someone when your like ill give you eight defence pots for one life pot and theyre like nah dude big scam big scam you give me sixteen def pots and ill give you two mana pots like that gay but overall if you are planning to spend money on this game i dont recommend it but if you are going to f2p this game like it was originally supposed to be sure give this game a quick try
early access reviewdont loose your time playing this game its pretty good till you get third rank after third rank there will be hundreds thousands of donation imbalance tanks weapons etc and till fifteen rank you could have shity fcking rifle that kills in three or four shots forget about balance and fairness thats not about this game p s if your mom gives you more than four for meal per day and you dont want to spend it for something more useful you could donate it and lick devs a s s
early access reviewdo not purchase this game until its fixed the frame rate is garbage despite the graphics not justifying it it has issues with servers because neowiz idiotically thought theyd only need one server at launch instead of six now theyre locking people out of making characters on certain servers to handle the overpopulation how is that a reasonable fix what if half your friends got in on day one and made characters and played until higher level and now you cant make your character what even is the point of the head start if you cant actually play the headstart or if you lose your head start because you have to switch to a server your friends can actually make characters on ill rereview this game later upon them fixing the current glaring issues until now i would suggest absolutely nobody buy this game
early access reviewthe status of the game is pretty much at prealpha so dont bother installing it at least for now1 you should have put all the required game files on the steam server when the game download finishes from steam it starts downloading another half a gigabyte which by the way is so broken so at first it downloaded some three thousand and forty mb then it said the launcher is updated and i should restart it after doing that it doesnt download anything downloading files00 bs eta two the game laucnher has issues with ui at the top right a white square randomly appears from nowhere overlaying the close minimize and settings buttons3 disable seeding by default people want a game not a torrent client smfhif i ever make it to the game by some miracle i will try to update this review
early access reviewill try to not regurgitate i plan on playing this for awhile despite the negative review hoping that it gets better somewhat i would say that this game isnt on the level of other available mmos even with all of its performance issues resolved however performance this is a bad release maybe the worse ive seen on a release i would like to add to the already abundant complaints on this that i believe most of these could be positive reviews or at least delayed until people reached late game if the performance issues were not as bad as they currently are i think it would be worth checking out recent reviews later if the studio actually invests the effort in fixing this issue quality of life you cant trade between your own characters even premium currency is bound to a single character which is stuck on a character that i was going to switch off the ui is clean but not very customizable mouse binds are not a thing financial concerns a costume is twentysix hundreds lumena which is a little more that twenty usd you can almost get one lumina from a low level dungeon run which means if you ran a low level dungeon twentysix hundreds times you could get a costume that way you can also get a couple thirteen lumina from killing players almost nothing is bound to account meaning you might have to make purchases multiple time compared to other mmos i dont know how this game will make money the cash shop is overpriced incouraging players to stay away from it theres no subscription poor reviews will drive down sales ive purchased lumena from the game that i have never recieved money into the ether poor customization the skill tree has some very easy decisions where it would be foolish to go the other way chaining abilites arent nice it limits what you can do when compared to wow where you might have a skill rotation that is optimal this makes it bread and butter by force and makes skill availability in pvp a thing of luck sometimes it demands static rotations in dynamic situations
early access reviewthink of it like this germans advanced warfareusa a couple of kids having a birthday party at a paintball arenauneven teams easily spawn trapped weak guns if youre a low level buggy edit did i mention it was p2w i didnt mention it was p2w
how to easily beat people on assault mode theyre using ninja and wizard probably bring a cobra and spam bloon adjustment bring farm and dart monkey too on water maps its good to have a water tower
the simplicity of the game is what makes the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and i cannot tell you how much fun it is to learn how to play each class when i first branced out into other classes for real was when mvm came out and i was practically forced to play other roles to support the team and at that point its when i realized i had love for more than just the sniper and spy and i could learn to enjoy all the other classes too theres always something of each class everybody can enjoy maybe not everybodybut why do i hate this game even though i gave it a good rating the fact that this game is slowly dying and to me it seems like valve seems to care less and less about tf2 and just scrap up community maps for new updates and shove in skins and try to squeeze as much money as they can the last update wasnt terrible it had me playing for a couple more hours but it wasnt enough to bring me back to the good old days not only that but the prices of trading only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which makes trading dead unless you have unsuals on you but why bother leaving a good review you might ask because the only thing that tf2 seems to do right compared to every other game out there in the market is that no matter how much i hate this game get bored of it and realize how its dying every month or so i will eventually come back to it anyway the game is amazing and i cant deny it even if i wanted to tldr i ing hate this game but you should definetly still play it because i love it1210 would definetly get stabbed by a spy again
let me be clear this game takes some serious getting used to you will be lost for the first several hours and even after that figuring out how you fit into your teams overall objective is going to be difficult i had the major benefit of joining a platoon a group of squads and squad leaders working together under the command of a platoon leader early on and doing so went a long way towards helping me understand how to play the game well as an indavidual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team this means picking a class and sticking to it for the most part for those of you who think immediately i want to snipe some words of caution you will be killed countersniped and pushed around a lot in the begining your kill count will be low and firefights will be overwhelming the scope of this game is massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console cough cod cough just because you have a sniper rifle doesnt mean youre going to be a headhunting god out the gate battlefieldesqe bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capabilities will see to that you will likely be outperformed by hardscopers if you try to play the quickscope game here long weapon rechamber and reload times will ensure that why because this game does not feel that every soldier on the battlefield is equal headshots cannot kill every target in one hit especially depending on the rifle you use with a fair few requiring two or more hits to kill regardless of where you hit your target at a range beyond four hundred meters only the highest powered weapons will drop targets in one shot only one faction specific weapon has the damage output to headshot most targets in one hit at any range downside it has a trigger delay and that will throw your shots way off target starting to sound unfair welcome to planetside where every faction has very distinct pros and cons to its equipment sets and abilities for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight prepare to be outflanked double teamed and owned by vehicles en masse your kd is going to hurt in the begining no two automatic weapons are equal in any way find one that works well for you and stick to it with all of this said this game is not newbie friendly veteran players will have a more diverse set of weapons better implants and know many of the nooks and crannies you might try to hide in advantage being the layout of each continent has changed a few times over the years so there are plenty of spots yet to be used frequently this game is somewhat p2w allowing you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster however with the exception of a few differently colored weapon iterations whose stats are exactly the same as the base model nothing in this game is unobtainable by simply playing the game but it is a grind as is every mmo ever made still sound like your kind of challenge welcome to the battle for auraxis pick your side pick your guns and strap yourself in you arent in kansas anymore
this is the best hunting game i have played but the free to play model is actually a demo version if you want to truely enjoy this game then you will have to spend lots money into it i expected it to be something like the valve games free to playpay games custom skins for guns pay for guns custom player models and stuff that doesnt affect the gameplay that much but its not and i am sure that it will have more players if it would be you have to pay monthly if you want to hunt other animals and pretty much do everything what this game has to offer cannot recommend sadly because its a very good game i hope the developerspublishers change their methods cannot recommend it to anyone except if you want to just hunt a little bit the few animals you are allowed to hunt or you want to pay monthly for it
early access reviewits a big mtg ripoff with a far worse mulliogan rule and a bloated thirteen power card requirement and seventyfive card minimum deck size a knockoff with worse mechanics and im getting to the point on this game where i think it intentionally screws me like its my turn to lose ten games in a row from mana screwflood feels like a big game of paper rock sissors and a complete waste of my time this game angers me more than anything else in my life i just feel cheated constantly sometimes it just seems like your opponent has just been scripted to have answers to everything you draw because statistically it was their time to win and the art is really bad and i dont care about the lore at all and forget about ranked mode if you havent spent all of your allowance on this game so you can get all the legendary cards unlocked youre gonna have a bad timereally im done with this garbage
such a fantastic moba you will love every minute of the complex well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into definatly not pay to win the reason why i said you shouldnt play this game is because of the community everyone is a jerk lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing so they blame everyone els on the team this is almost every game these people make it incredibly hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you its just amazing how horrible people are at this game but are quick to judge my suggestion is to skip this game because what ever time place or day you decide to get on to play this beautiful game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood the only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you if you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team again a fantastic moba it is just littered with its community
early access reviewi have played this game for a while and i must say its so much fun with friendspros pretty graphicsit is always updated with new legendsnot p2wit has a few different modes to playmade to destroy friendships if you ever had anycons frustrating when you play in online against waaaay better players or spammersstill miss my friends tough eight hundred and ten
despite my lack of experience i have found planetside two to be a very balanced and entertaining mmofps respawns are short you can pick your battles and even new players can take on veterans if they know what theyre doing air vehichles are hard to control and the map can sometimes be confusing but overall a great game to invest your time in
early access reviewfractured space has a great deal of depth and tactical complexity a new player can pick up the basic mouseandkeyboard commands after a few matches and yet a one hundred hour veteran can still find new tricks and tactics the recent change for ship acquisition makes the grind for new ships very manageable new players can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ships while leaving a few more expenive and newer ships as goals to pursue the only purchaseable elements are purely cosmetic or means to bypass some of the unlock grind despite some reviews here this game is absolutely not paytowin the design team is very active in releasing new updates to the game while some bugs and significant ship balance issues remain as is typical for an alphastage game the updates have largely been incrementally improving the game for the past yearandahalf key features deep tactially spaceship combatbeautiful visuals esp for an alphamanageable unlock rateno ptw elementsactive development teamweaknesses some server lag and stability issuesgrowing but currently limited player baseship balance still a try it today fractured space boasts massive spaceships looks great and its free theres nothing to lose and the game continues to grow improve and evolve with every update
good game but the devs have certainly gave up on the game which is a shame you get people using the same strategies over and over because they are op and it gets boring some towers are really good and some are awful it is a shame because the game would be alot better if everyone had their own personal favourite towers which they used and things like that
so i quit for awhile and all my freinds had told me not to come back because it became even more pay to play well i didnt listen to em because im stubborn as hell and i saw they added magpie geese today i was super excited then i saw how much the whole setup costed and said forget that so i found a server finally with a setup and im like cool ill shoot a few and ill be happy so i bought a flag and lone behold i got four flocks to break super happy till i realized theese things arnt like the canadian geese or the mallards they will literally land a mile away from you if you dont have a short range caller so with that being said and after all the money ive put into this game i sure hope call of the wild adds birds because i will no longer support this game and their greedy ambitions sad it honestly was such a good game not saying there wasnt microtransactions but this is honestly rediculous twenty seven for a full setup for one bird you guys are nuts dont play this game if you wanna shoot waterfowl wait intill call of the wild adds it and buy that and with how they release updates thatll be a year or two because theyre more worried about the console updates atm
is a very fun game its an interesting exploring game very beutiful and guess what its freeif you like minecraft you will like this game the art is beautiful the gameplay is great no actual story but no one wants one free server hosting honestly you should try this game
has absolutely no support for this game the support website requires you to sign up too game crashes often as well also you loose any items you use like event tickets when it crashes uninstalling
excellent car sounds physics as far as i can tell for free content nice interface as well most settings are easy to find but some like fov seems harder to find ghost cars and racing lines sometimes dont work yes i do not know the made up tracks some bugs on the free maps are the tyres warm or not dont have any indication except for four tyres at the bottom most cars seem to be planted on the road red bull ring track seems mostly flat eg no bumps when driving less visual and road details on off track compared to assetto corsas red bull ring free content is good hey its free love the hillclimb map the microtransaction model is a big nono for me however one for being able to test cars before you purchase them i recommend trying out this product if it fits your needs
early access reviewbrainless fun like call of duty some guns need balance changes mostly damage checks the maps ive played so far are the bane of my existence but i didnt download expecting much play if you want to kill time
an mmorpg like minecraft gameplay that you can fish sail in the sea ride a different mount enter dungeons trade with players fly in the sky craft items build your own club etc the problem of this game is that when you check your ping by typing ingame debugtext its really lag it takes time to load the terrain sometimes fast even thou you are lag it is still playable you just get lag teleporting from one place to another
running simulator 2016pros zombies are easy to killplenty of weapons to finddont die of hunger currentlyplayer count is suprisinly highcons barely any zombie or player interaction so you are basically alone the whole timeconfusing server joining and menustamina is so low for how far you have to runzombies suck at killing youweapon spam makes any noob able to kill even an experienced player i got three player kills and two zombie kills in the first fifteen minutes of playing the gamehorrible graphics and textures
after two thousand hours of playing this game i still cant get enough ggg has to be one of the best if not the best game developers out there theyve done such a great job with this game if you like grinding games for better loot this is for you if youre new to this genre youre gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game its definitely a lot to take in as a new player but once youve figured it out it becomes so addicting theres new leagaues implemeneted every thirty four months which allows for fresh economiesnew aspects to the game its my favorite part the devs are constantly updatingrebalancing the passive tree which is freaking amazing so you shouldnt get to in love with any given play styleskillbuild if youre new definitely follow some of the big streamers so you can stay up to date on decent builds to use for new leagues theres tons more i can say but ill leave it here download poe and have fun grinding
steam reported hours 120th of my playtime standalone launcher used mostlyall in all an incredible implementation of the dd universe all fans will be thrilled especially with dragon fights omg loads of content stunning environments easy to learn yet hard to master meaning you can simply mash your way through as a dumb hero or become a god if you apply yourself and an rpg well worth putting time into the amount of content and weeks of gametime provided in the f2p model is incredible the voice acting is world class and the quests vary from profound to wonderfully ridiculous if you then choose after finally completing all of the story content which is immense to then push for the end game content or pvp you can attain equal footing through some grinding which is still fun in a group or you can go ahead and pay the people who gave you this all for free and continue to play with the grinding aspect lowered at that level alternatevily there are regular events all grand fun and many other dungeons you can immerse yourself in without end game gear and have a fantastic time just exploring all the locations properly or socialising in one of the very many highly active guilds people complaining about p2w must get off their high horse as i fail to see how they expect servers to magically stay active and fresh content in this games case pretty much monthly appear without the programmers getting paid servers need upkeep designers need to feed themselves and coders need their coffee people free to play models are essentially an involved extended demo these days imho and if you like it buy it
"early access reviewtrying to play and apparently there is no sea server yetprobably playing with approx three hundred ish ping tried to win my game with constant teleportation hit a guy once and get shot three times ate lots of stuff got my first mark three helmet happily played with one thousand, one hundred and forty two fps and sudden drop into sixty six fps and when its ten people left it crashed cant get mad because it is free will not recommend this to any sea player yetprobably but the graphic is good"
what the hell did they do to this game i sued to be able to run this game on this machine just fine with pretty much no lag now when i can get the game running without it crashing which seems to be random its just a laggy mess from start to finish its so bad its not even playable for me anymore and i used to play this game all the time on this machine wtf happened
early access reviewthis is basically malware its fun yes but it behaves exactly like malware installs some dodgy torrent it uses to updateseeds the torrent on its ownauto starts itself and updatesdoesnt delete when its uninstalled this game constantly updating in the background even when ive tried to disable it caused me to have latency issues beyond belief for any game i play on my system not worth it bois
early access reviewthis is awful my friend can play the game no issue at all i just got a fourteen hour premium and i cant go on the game it says that it is a server error sort yourselves the out devs

this game gives me power of unimaginable force with the strength i recive i shall be able to become the true otaku dont play this game its weird and lovely at the same time
im giving this a recommend because it seem fairly competantly put together and from my few hours playing it i didnt run into anything awkward obviously comparisons to minecraft are hard to avoid my first impression is that its like a simplified version of minecraft with some other changes the most noticable difference in my opinion is that its far more visually attractive the monsters are far more interesting your character actually looks like a person and all of the blocks look like they came with one of those fancy texture add ons from the start it also has teleporters which i like a lot it doesnt have hunger or levels or enchanting or anything like that as far as i can tell the lack of hunger is sort of nice and your character can jump real good which means you can mine and get around without it constantly being an ordeal its a free to play game obviously so theres a lot of tailoring intending to get you to by pro version which is a one time buy of twenty dollars also there is apparently some kind of coin system where you can buy predesigned structures to build which honestly sort of confuses me because what is the point of the game then you can also buy all kinds of in game items with microtransactions which starts seeming like a bit much it feels very polished but at the same time its true their particular method of encouraging you to go pro is kind of annoying i have no problem with microtransactions in otherwise free games but i hate it when those microtransactions are just flat out buying items that should be getting crafted in game and that layered on top of the pro version is weird because that means they ultimately want you to both buy the pro version and buy these random item packs like maybe give me more consmetic options instead or something idk maybe its because im just sick of minecraft in general but after getting myself set up i didnt see much need to progress any further it doesnt feel like it has a lot of options over all and if youve already got the build a house out of blocks thing out of your system it doesnt feel like from a glance that this game is offering anything very fresh in that regard in summary there are a lot of ui things and aesthetics that are way better than minecraft but mechanically its not very exciting also there doesnt seem to be any ranged weapons whats with that
camperscampers and more campers everywhere i am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive the worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to farmkill or camp you its more like a player survival not zombie
pros if you enjoy httyd you will love this game i wish they made games like this for all my fandoms it takes a long ime to finish all the quests and when you do there are in game expansion packs that add on even more they have pretty much every single dragon ever mentioned in the moviesshows cons there are so many glitches it can get annoying but if you go on their website and look at bug complaints other people have had the same problems and have found ways around it overall it is a fun game and its free so why even hesitate if you dont like it you can just erase it
this game is the best game you can get for free it fun intense and you enjoy with friend if it was a star rating i would give it a five star rate it is beauty full in graphic and how it looks it a bad game there to much to explain thats why you must get it
good game with good longevity the serer access aka ping on the asia server best for new zealand is given that this game requires the odd in app purchase to avoid endless monotony that is frankly unacceptable and i is not the nz based isps issue
lol opened the game joined a server because i couldnt create one without a membership got into the game had really confusing controls with awful movement mechanics than i walked around got a road scoped in saw a fox tried to shoot it and a popup appeared saying i couldnt as i didnt have the right license closed the game and now im writing this review its garbage
this game is so great you can simulate the entire latvian air force step one get in four mi8 helicopters step two somehow damage one of them step three never repair the damaged helicoper step four be left with three helicopters step five wait for nato to help you
had a blast in this game over the couple years ive played i know the hours dont seem to show it either game can be a bit grindy at times but if you grab a buddy for the ride can be good fun
i had not plaied any flight sim games in some years until last week my freind was talking about dcs and being free i figured id give it a try hands down the best flight sim i have ever plaied and it has brought back the love i have for avaition 1010i will say however it is not for thoses who want the casual flying of a jumbo jet or island hopper even the simplified planes require a good amount of practice with and tweaking of controls to fly well and operate well in combat the full sim planes are a blast to figure out and when you get it right you feel like you acomplished something the simple planes give you the ability to get into combat faster since you do not have to spend all your time just geting an engine started or maintaining settings while in flight if you are looking for a real combat flight sim this is it its just plane awesome
this game was actually quite fun in my opinion the problem with a lot of people is they dont realize that there is a free rotation of what you can kill each week without paying i however played for one hour and managed to kill two dears all while free to play and honesetly i enjoyed following the tracks and backtracking when i got lost on the trail it was quite realistic and the game looks absolutely beautiful its a yes from me guys keep it up
afk simulator afk heaven whole team afk but jokes aside this game needs to do something about afkers that sometimes can be your whole team everything else is mostly good except for matchmaking which quite awful at times and puts in immposible situations and game turns into a one shot central and thats why its such a shame to see this game getting otterly ruined by the vast number of afk players im loosing intrest to play this game because of that and cant recommend anyone to play this afk simulator one other issue i found out is the massive flaw in matchmaking game puts up teams that are heavily underpowered against a much higher tier setup in this scenario enemy tanks are basically invincible and everyone just sits back in spawn and wait for the game to end
what the hell guys i thought you guys wanted world of tanks without arty here you are complaining why cause its not what we wanted since its the wrong one hey you guys do know that wot pc big wotthe one on worldoftanks com not baby wotblitzis a huuuugeee file like 40gbs i think maybe i dunno i dont care all i know is that its a good game im not looking at this like oh for shame on you wg we wanted wot on steam this is how you pay us with wot blitz unacceptable if your like that fine go play world of tanks but world of tanks blitz is different they both do great at what they want to portait here wotbig wot is great at realism while wotbbaby wot is good for those who have a terrible computer still want the world of tanks expirience in my opinion they are both different games you cant say that one is worse that the other cause one of them is originaly a mobile game and dont say that wotbig wot is a saint cause your wrong they both have thier flaws thier stengths but they also have different audiences wotb is for people who dont like the console version but yet still wants a competitive yet fair playing field in a quick matter while wotthe one that everybody is saying that you should go dl instead is for those who want to play a game that is a bit more detailed historicaly driven but pretty is much the same imo i mean cmon your still shooting enemy tanks if you do damage credits xp come out
its just button mash the game so if you like breaking your z and x key to win at the game will this game is for you and if you like easy as games this is also for you and on top of that your player is so edgy as players well you came to the right place and im not saying it bad and im also not saying it good so yeah give it a try p s its a pay to win as well so if you like taking money from your mom or dad to buy go right a head and make your player even more edgy then it already is
early access reviewive played twentyfive hours and i can safely say that this game is great and its only getting better if you are on the fence about buying this you should totally do it because once you get past the tier one ships it becomes really fun the sniper is a fantastic ship in particular and one of my personal favorites once you get past the learning curve there is a ton of gameplay and lots of fun to be had
every time i get on the game is glitched it says that steam needs to be opened even though it is and the game wont start have to reinstall it everytime dont waste youre time with this
early access reviewpretty good game same concept as pubg and fortnite its very high quality game with good mechanics and controls and its free hopefully the developers behind this game will keep on updating it and not make it a pay to win game very solid game
this game is a pretty awesome game if you liked world of warcraft you will like this game it takes some time getting used to after other mmorpgs but once youre into it its really fun and way better thatn wow ypu get so much content for free and the game is awesome of course there are microtransactions but you should just ignore them the game si free they need something to make money of overall i advise anyone to try this game out for themselves
it been a good game so far who said old games suck graphics are old but thats normal i like it heres a little tip if you spend one dollareuro on this game your experience will be better
its free thats always good right play it have fun fall in love just like a golddigging girlfriend this game screws you over the moment you spend money on it i spent one hundred and eighty i thought i bought it but no i go back into the game and it still tells me i have to buy all the tracks and all the cars so im just wondering wtf did i just spend one hundred and eighty on the least it could do is give me a blow job play the free part its actually fun spend the money and regret it
pim holfve ceo of the company something about the freetoplay model of experiencing video games has always rubbed me the wrong waywith freetoplay you can t be too aggressive with monetisationthe game is full of bugs and is a massive cash grab
infestation
finally a game for people like us to enjoy put aside your copy of mein kampf turn off the imported torturescat porn movie from japan that youre watching close the skylight curtains to your basement flat and obsess over the assembly and disassembly of a wide variety of firearms for hours hopefully theyll release dlc where we can repeatedly enact shooting people before chopping them up and storing their body parts in the fridge one thousand and ten would masturbate again
this is a very combo focused game there is a limit to how many hits you can land consecutively so youll have to figure out what sequence of attacks work well for you to deal as much damage during your combo perhaps my favorite aspect of the game and maybe the only reason i play it is the pvp arena its fun to play against others and you may meet some new friends or build up hate towards each other during pvp you can play in 1v1s 2v2s or 3v3s just 2v2 matches get hectic so you can only imagine how insane 3v3s can get there are also fields for you to level up in and dungeons to do with auto selected parties or with your own party of people the story quests are keen on making you repeat the same dungeons however it gets a little less repetitive later on though that might just be me getting used to doing the same one dungeon over and over all in all the only thing keeping this game fun to me is the pvp aspect
early access reviewthis game was a fun game to play with my freinds but after the new updates the game has set me further away from where i was before it used to be to be a tankman you had to be level three and for a pilot level four but now it is to be a tankman you have to be level five and to be a fighter pilot level six so now i have to grind even more to get to the same point as i was before dont bother to play this because all it does is mess u about and annoy you
i downloaded this game not because im familiar with how to train your dragon but because the description reminded me of a game i hadnt played in nearly two decades call dragonseeds for the playstation one i came into this not even thinking that it was possible for a game to be released nowadays with graphics that are on par with a sixteen year old game not to mention this pay system twenty minutes into the game and youll already have a large flashing button on the ui telling you that you have ten days to pay for a starter pack and thats not even the first thing behind gems you come in contact with when you have to pick an egg for your future dragon the ones not even two steps away from where you start are locked for members only you want a cool dragon five please you want to skip the tutorial five please you want to have a second character slot membership pleaseyou want a third character more money pleasefourth cashfifth even more moolah
early access reviewin its current early access alpha stage i think this game is very nicelooking and fun obviously it could use balancing and fixes and stuff since its alphaearly access but its fairly good so far very interesting and varied ship designs with nice themes based on factions if youre interested in graphics then you might like the fact that the game looks very good even on low settings although i will say the station models could use work not that its much of a problem though since youre usually shooting other ships as for gameplay its good that there are a somewhat wide variety of abilities and strategies based on the ships you use the unlocking system doesnt feel like it takes too long although itd be nice if getting credits was just a bit faster the premium currency doesnt oversaturate the game either which is a plus they dont shove it down your throat like other games also i might be a tad biased because i got the game for free props to these guys for the free weekend that let me keep the game three
early access reviewive been playing this game on and off from the day it came out with this latest update they reset all ribbon progress that means all the hours put into this game were completely wasted uninstalling this game as we speak after all the posts on their forums they have clearly stated they dont care and are happy to see players leave im done here as much as it pains me to say this dont bother with this game it was fun back in the day but the developers will clearly do anything they can to make you send them actual money again go play another game if you value your time as the developers clearly do not
the elder scroll legends game steals shamelessly from hearthstone and this makes it a good game where it is unique from hearthstone it is gimmicky but those places are few and far between the pros if you play hearthstone you already know how to play how to get around and how to win it is shiny and beautiful with better voice acting than the aaa elderscrolls games i know not saying muchit has more modes and game types than hearthstone the most important pro to me it is still a manageable size i left hearthstone behind because it was a bloated complicated mess with more content dumped on top weekly this is currently a great size and as a new game there is less of a pro userbase to kick me down realnoobtalkthe cons the ai although fun to play is fairly weak it makes clumsy decisions frequently it steals almost everything from heathstone and comes across as an amature effort because of that i mean it steals everything there is a heavy imbalance towards going second the triple gem ring keeps you tight on curve and makes it hard to lose we shall see i am eight hours in and i dont even have that much time for games any more
pay2win cant win against deck full of legendary op cards fun mechanics though too bad the balance is so poor if there would be limit like two legendary cards in a deck it would be a lot more balanced but there are no sane limits to amount of legendary or epic cards in deck by the time i write this review i played twenty hours on steam and around the same on mobile its great till you start playing ranked and get thrown against fulllegendary decks at rank 9look at this legendary https www legendsdecks look at this common https www legendsdecks the difference
my personal favorite arpg the leveling system is expansive allowing for a range of builds naturally varying from the obscene and the useless up to the content destroyers featuring a great community and a fantastic dev team who are constantly trying to fix issues and interacting with their playerbase with huge updates every year adding new content furthermore the unique items which are rare item drops that have special properties are actually interesting and can even define new builds some are better suited for leveling but others add new mechanics that beautifully combine with the other skills available in the game and to top it all off it is free to play the game does feature microtransactions mainly purely cosmetic however it is definitely worth putting in a small bit of money to purchase additional stash tabs to relief some of the constant inventory management especially if you have a tendancy to hoard everything nothing can be bought which will improve your character so no pay to win elements
not really sure why everyone is so negative about this game it is free for fcks sake yes i agree it isnt one thousand and ten gaming masterpeice but it also isnt three thousand and sixty like the one thousand and ten games are does it have some glitches sure look at my play time it has crashed maybe twice crashing is not as big of a problem as people would have you believeis it missing some features that other games have of course but for a free game it runs well it has enough features and is generally fun enough to justify the purchase of free99
early access reviewgame was perfect for me pre epicfail loot patch now its just like a gambling game with more action was planning to buy premium but nahhh cons you cant earn in game currency unless you recycle worthless parts for thirty of their value when you buy them freepayjam forcing us to pay for premium so we could earn more parts per crate before epic fail loot update you can do fine without premium loot drops they give still give parts like cubes and such even after the rngesus fix your team will most likely win if you have the most advanced weapons i e homing missles shotguns that stealth device which i forgot what its called pros fun game addictive that feeling of my robot will be better than other peoples robot feel you can build anything you want from tanks to planes will stop playing robocraft until payjam fixes the game if not then i will wait for that game similar to robocraft but more gritty called crossout

early access reviewgreat game ninety nine except1 tdm maps are wayyy to small2 grenades are wayyy to op3 sniper scope sens needs to be seperate to holosight sens5 needs to be an oceania region
early access reviewthe biggest gay only for gays like me can we hit ten thousand likes for ninja and his recovery from ligmamany
i love it i play it way more then any of the games ive payed for sure its grindy as heck as many players exploit factions strong point but come on who doesnt exploit a game for a bit every once in a while but it is still a great game servers can suck but maybe thats just australia xd i recommend to anyone who likes a bit of a grind and a good war game
yo honestly this card game kicks especially if you have played enough of anany elder scrolls games and you understand what the cards are based on and such fun gameplay its free and ive never spent any real money and still got a really cool deck easy to get coins and is just a fun game i had way more hours on the bethesda launcher but i scrapped it for the steam launcher to not have a dumb a s s launcher for one game1010 with a magicka cost of eleven
"i find fallout shelter to be an amazing game just dont use your money to buy anything like ever i spent thirty on my game and had weapons for everyone everything was perfect then out of nowhere invincible molerats overran my shelter i paused and googled if paidfor objects and such carried out between saves but sadly they did not i wasted thirty on this game just so i could be easily overran it was basically like me spending two thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine for the game but once you lost you lost the game too this is the only reason i do not recommend this game i strongly disapprove that they be locked to specific saves especially considering the fact i spent my hardearned real moneyoh you lost thanks for playing please insert another 2999its like a sick overlyexpensive arcade machine that instead of quarters costs two thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine and you dont get three lives nope just one lose it and you have to pay an arm and a leg just to start overthis happened a couple months or so ago but just now decided to rate it final conclusionif you play this do not spend any of your money on thisotherwise a great game"
early access reviewall f2p card games have a catch this game is the shiftstone dustdust a common card gives one one shiftstone you need thirtytwo hundreds shiftstones to craft one legendary in other words this game has tons of useless cards it wastes peoples time to look at imho all cards should be useful and interesting
eight hundred and ten the ideaology behind this game is similar to minecraft yet the core gameplay is much different than minecraft i thoroughly enjoyed playing it with all my friends and we play it for hours on a regular basis the only reason this isnt one thousand and ten is because i keep getting dropped frames maybe add an option to reduce them i know several other games that have options to help keep a stable framerate and it would be great if this one became one of them would definitely consider buying the pro version just dont have the money yet
early access reviewits an alright game graphics are pretty good and the gameplay would be awesome except you go into a queue where you are matched with others to form a squad and have to keep waiting for timers to count down for the game to start holding the base is a great idea but there are no real directions on how to move around when starting out so you have to build up your accuracy over time and end up going through the meat grinder a lot
calling it free to play is pretty deershit since the free part is really limited try if you even like the game deal you can only hunt rabbit and one type of deer but for this game the forty euros for a year of licence is not bad and you get loads of stuff with it and if you buy something with money like new guns and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumables and just buy the types of guns to suit your hunting style and your fine also the ammo replenish after hunts so you only need a case or two because the yearly subscription fee is not that big and you get loads of stuff with it i think it is actually pretty fair just dont expect to do much without paying and yes if you like hunting and the game the developer fully deserve your money best hunting simulator since deer hunter series and i played that for hours and hours but it is definitely not for everyone but playing this with friends or even sometimes with some random people online is tons of fun it really shines in multiplayer
has a few nice elements but overall quite boring and repetitive music and sounds free things popping up at the start then i just got used to it some visuals humor repetitive going through sixty boring rooms and then getting killed out of nowhere waste of time story movement cant slide on edges blocks your movement monsters jumping out of nowhere and killing youoverall five hundred and ten
dcs world is a great hardcore combat flight sim with a crazy amount of detail and i love it for that but something about the game doesnt feel the same as il2 nineteen fortysixs or strike fighters two i think it comes down to a few things with me one content is lacking compaired to il2 and sf2 the game feels a little barebones with its selection of aircraft yes the detail is much higher in dcs but i would rather see eagle dynamics come out with more playable aircraft if it means dropping the detail to that of fc32 no middle ground its full sim or nothing in dcs and thats fine but tbh i like the way il2 and sf2 handle sims and having the option just to set things as easy or as hard as i want sometimes i just want to blow s up without going though the hassel three mod support this leads back to the issue of not having a wide selection of aircraft in dcs and its far from having any type of mod library that gets close to il2 or sf24 price of dlc now im no stranger to paying for dlc on a simulator god knows i spent a lot in train simulator but thats the thing for me it comes down to why pay when i can get a mod for sf2 if they lowered the cost i wouldnt mind picking put more then what i have but at fifty i find it hard to justify getting one dcs world is a great sim but is it on my favorites list no it doesnt have the aircraft i like and it doesnt give me the same joy and gameplay experience that i look for in a sim seven hundred and ten
this is a really solid card game that takes many ideas of similar games and combines all the best parts wile keeping most of the bad stuff out that being said conscription the last nerf is neglagable for telvani conscription because of all the ramp in those colors and why did you nerf ash berserker would recomend
best part of this game was when they released the bicycle haha now i dont even have it installed and when that came out it wasnt even close to being on here and the american camo lol give me a break only camo was the frog camo almost had the mp44 then it went to pay to own no more no thanks iam done it was fun when i t was first released outside of steam now no
they give you a lot of cards for playing yes do any of those cards ever go in your deck no can you scrap them to make a card you actually want yes that is if youre willing to scrap a whole booster to make a rare you need x4 and cant get out of a booster becuase they wont give you a pack from a set that actually matters for your deck why not just buy a booster ok but its a waste compared to spending the in game currency on a forge or draft not that you should bother with a forge you basically play draft mode against bots that have preconstructed decks its almost fun until you win a few and now the mix of picking semirandom cards and the fact that the ai level has been increased theyre deck just starts working better and better you will lose becuase you drew twosix power in a row while they lay down legendaries you wish the randomness of the forge had granted you an answer to
creativerse enters the released game genere with a positive review by me while some still are bemoaning the pro upgrade they have to remember that about eighty of the craftable content is free to play with this game many of their reviews show evidence that they lack an understanding on how the crafting system recipies and blueprints work it takes more than an hour or two of gameplay to understand these things fullywith that said i want to talk about the blueprints that are also availible many totally misunderstand this part of the game and see the coin pricetag but miss how to get nearly all the blueprints for free the pricetag is only if you want all the blocks now what this means is if you craft the corner stone for the blueprint and place it where you want the structure the blueprint will walk you through building it all you have to do is collect the resources make the blocks then place them where the blueprint tells you to place it free while there are still a few bugs in the blueprint system such as blocks being required to face in wrong directions the devs are aware of this and are working to correct this on a blueprint by blueprint update hopefully it gets finished soon though they are more focusing on game bugs in the code than a misdirected block in a free blueprint understandably at the heart of this game unlike the similar minecraft game creativerse takes place on an online server so internet is required to play this game in the free version you are limited in the features and number of personal worlds you create this is understandable due to server space equates to money the pro upgrade gives you more control and additional worlds you can create that being said if you want your world to be private and for you only you can set it as such and even password it so only you can enter it once the password has been entered once it doesnt need to be entered again from my experiance you can make it just as easy a private server world where only you and your friends have access or a public one that any can join a newer feature in creativers that i have yet to explore so will be very brief on is the ability to build and share adventures along with having rewards for those who visit and review it while having not made any yet to share this feature does show promise and eventually i will jump into this part and update my review when i have in building your world you can claim land to keep others friends or foes from altering the area you are building in this includes blowing things up with explosives pro players have extra free claims per world and more flexability to the rules they sit compared to the free to play players one of a few nice incentives to purchase the pro dlc the building part of the world seems a little clumbsy and confusing at first but once you learn how the crafting system works it becomes really easy and fast just keep at it keep unlocking block recipies by building blocks and you will get the hang of it it will take more than an hour or two for you to get the hang of things on your first time playing aslo expect to die from silly things until you gain an understanding on the mechanics if you have played minecraft this part is a little more confusing where as all recpies are known you just figure them out in creativers you must learn how to construct from the recipies and unlock the locked ones by building other recipies that come before such as what is needed for an iron door is unknown until you first build the wooden door this is where many who have negitive reviews are getting confused with what is free and pro remember just because it is locked doesnt mean it isnt free it simply means it must be learned some recipies the only way to learn them is to find them in a chest or a drop less than twenty of the availible recpies must be purchased with coins and those are mostly cosmetic also do note that some recipies are only availible during specific events such as halloween and christmas additionally there are a few limited time recipies from the store grab those free ones while you cannext the graphic detail of the game is great in my opinion it reminds me of minecraft but with a mod to give the game the hd textures the gameplay is reminescent of minecraft for those of use who played it but i feel it is a touch easier to play i do miss the mods but i suspect in time mods will become availible and possibly incuraged however i do not foresee this as something soon due to how this game works at the core some also bemoan the pro upgrade when it came out due to those features were in the early access free while under testing were moved into the pro feature after doing some hunting in the forums it was pointed out that these were being added free so they had a large player base to find bugs and correct them before pro was released remember people it was early access and availible so they could test the feature before they made people pay money for them and really the game is fully playbale without the glider fun and somewhat useful and you simply need to manage your inventory without the added 2x space in your backpack you can also get by without buying additional land plots and the free to play worlds are just as usable as the pro worlds the lack of pro features are not game breaking considering the game is mostly centered around teamwork and not compitition competing with each other was the last thing on the devs mind when pro was released and it really gives marginal advantage if people are competing with all that being said the game gets a huge thumb up from me and i look forward to the new content as it comes out
alright guys i have about five hundred and seventy hours in this game so i guess its time for a review so as you all see it says its a free to play it actually is though but heres the catch that free word can be quite tricky you see when you start playing the game you get all pumped like oh boy im gonna kill everything well your wrong because youre basically gonna be playing a demo you get a few animals to shoot as long with two animals you can hunt that rotate through out every week you cant create your own multiplayer server but you can join others the game will always make you feel like you have to buy more and more and sometimes you give in but if you dont want to spend money thats fine but before you go all oh i hate this game free to play my quot why dont you just give it a shot and spend atleast a few hours twenty three trying to find a male whitetail or something it also helps to have a friend there with you that knows this game better this game almost sucks without a friend when you first start playing theres a hunting forums for this game and this community loves to help out new players my point is this game isnt that bad if you just give it a shot
team fortress two is a wonderful gem on steam this amazing first person shooter is a wonderful relief from the seriousness of other first person shooter and games with a well balanced array of nine classes to choose from there is something for everyone in this title
early access reviewjust not really a big fan on this but if you like a mmo style and your a br type of person here is a game for you stand point of games this is your game right here

best first person shooter on pc if you are looking for teamwork squad based battles on an epic scale this is it i would say you dont need to spend money on this free to play and its definitely not pay to win however if you want to unlock cosmetics for your vehicles you can spend money doing so i have also spent money on unlocking weapons but you dont need to do it as the difference in weapons is not that noticable in game i love the diversity of combat in this game and the vehicles are cool i recommend joining one faction only at a time ive gone tr for life baby
to all the hatersthis game is awesome i really like hack and slash rpg manga type gamesits also side scrolling too who cares if you need to buy costumes in game you can get them in drops from questsi recommend this game1010 would play as raven again
product received for freeearly access reviewvery fun very goodthings that good idklots of food that satisifes me because im fatgood graphixvery funwonky physichsthing badstoo many weapontoo many ammo typeunoptimizedhard to master overall eight hundred and ten gotyalso nerf browning five auto pls thanks
early access reviewpretty awesome free to play shooter if you like really close quarter engages and mostly hip firing but the overall the maps are too small and the spawn points are a problem to make it fun for a longer period for me free to play and the proggresion system is pretty fast compared to most other free to play games good servers no lag at all great graphics that my decent laptop can handle with no problem you get a great primary gun and sidearm from the start and additional guns are pretty easy to obtain all guns feel viable most of the maps feel way too small only having two or three corridors spawn points are too close to eachother two steps and youre already in the enemy spawn sentry turrets are to play against and its not instantly visible if its friendly or not most classes feel kinda meh destroy is a game mode where you need to defend your containers but half of them are closer to the enemy spawn than your own
early access reviewpersonally i love playing this game with my friends however in the interest of progression i have a few suggestions for development of the game now im not an expert or anything but just consider this the thoughts of a seasoned gamer first off i would like too see more work put in to customizing all the characters movesets making each one feel more unique secondly the overall movement feels a bit off not bad per se just off a brawler needs to be a bit more fastpaced than this one is the gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful and a slight increase in character speed couldnt hurt either and finally the maps now i know this is still early access but a little more variation would be nice as a suggestion what about opening map development to steam users and a ranking system to make the better built maps show up more frequently all in all this is a good start but needs some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that smash bros does i like this game and hope the developers read this review
early access reviewthe game wont launch stuck at loading seventy six for fifteen minutes like the lady said aint nobody got time for that google it if you dont understand the reference lmao
неплохой таймkiller на подобии clash of clans огромный минус этой игры то что очередность хода выстроена по типу кто дроже и круче тот и ходит те в pvр бою попав на определенных соперников сливаешь тк тебя уже обстреляли и отмутузили а ты тока one ход делаешь а так впринцыпе неплохо из ten баллов six
early access reviewi apologize for the poor grammari just refunded and let me tell you whynote i read the apology letter from the exec producer was touched but not convinced1 artifical economy why are you capping min and max price ranges on items in the ah i feel like this is a laaaaazzzy way of trying to stop botters and cheaters like come on now2 web browser ah why is the auction house a damn browser three no end game content self explanatory although the executive producer did mention something in his apology letter about all the real stuff will come in 12weeks well maybe you shouldnt have launched yet getting pushed back is better than this fiasco right now4 feeling like a mobile mmo game so i played crusaders of light and it feel bless online gave me the that exact feeling except with better twenty twelves pc graphics auto run to quests that auto run to you an area then you are given a vague mistranslated detail on how to complete your quest five pay to win right now there is some pay for convenience aspect of the game going on such as using rl money to buy gems that give you teleportation to certain dungeons etc nothing major but this just opens the door for more p2w stuff6 delay in combat to be honest i really like the combat it was fun trying to combo these spells together into creative spell chains but it was so clunky and felt delaaaaayeeeedddd whenever i would hit my stance conversion and try to cast a follow up spell often the game was running so poorly that i would miss the follow up spell i would constanly spam and check for a confirmation but nope i would just miss the spell completely basically what im saying is the combat is not very smooth seven translation what can i say anything in the english language that has ag is censored you can say the most vulgar things but you cannot say words like again bag lag you cannot even type neowiz out because it is censored some of the spell translations are off too so sometimes you just have to guess at what you are doing8 not so rewarding grinding anything that isnt combat related is boring as hellll9 this one is a positive i like the voice acting10 this is more like some advice lets come back in a month and see what happens maybe it changes like the exec producer said it would
i nominated this game for the just five more minutes awardyou have an early day tomorrow you need to get some sleep so you re just going finish one more match before you decide to tuck in for the night just one more wait one more what s that you say it s two thirty am yep most of you can relate overall its a solid moba game like one of the reviewer said its not pay to win the in game purchases are for cosmetic purpose only the cons is that this is moba game means you play with people and people can be annoying sometimes well maybe a lot but the game provided options to play with ai so you can still play alone my score nine hundred and ten for the game510 for the community
first off let me just say that this game is simply amazing and extremely realistic you can not get this sort of fun and realism within a simulator besides this one the only down side is that you have to be individual aircraft that vary in prices but the ones that are over thirty are not worth spending your money on i recommend getting the ones that are cheaper in price not in quality overall i give this game a nine hundred and ten
rollercoaster of emotions spent much konghong dollar and cried inside made me realise i have a problem with money my wife left me because i spent all our money on dice rolls you karen
s tiest game ever try joining a server disconnectedsecond attempt disconnectedthird attempt disconnectedfourth attempt waiting the game to loads foreverdisconnected again1010 would get cancer
that feeling when you are too lazy to download hearthstone and youre also addicted to the elder scrolls with this game you can play hearthstone and feel the elder scrolls universe still cool and would recommend when the elder scrolls is life
early access reviewvoted game of the yearamazing game how is this free start pushing skins and camos and you will be rich from snowboarding zipplining hang gliding to getting a kill so much fun love the entire ui and menu system all works great together first and third person view is smooth only negative is maybe speed up the time all in all great gamethank you
early access reviewgot the game like a year ago when if you downloaded it on free to play weekend you got to keep the game looks like a slideshow weird considering my two thousand and fours toshiba laptop should be able to run it
early access reviewlike the title says this game is full of jump scares adorable jump scares from adorable little 2d monsters you progress from adorable room to adorable room slowly finding each adorable little jump scare along the way then the adorable jump scares start following you then the adorable rooms start getting harder to navigate then the adorable rooms start changing this game is adorable this game is brilliant but above all this game is terrifying
i have thousands of hours in client as steam elsword crashes on me and i have nothing but good to say pros freedid i mention free simple combat that can lead into various complex or generally interesting combosvast character and skill differencesno bad or best characters its all about preferences and skill levelcons sometimes when you fullscreen or anything like that in steam the game crashes to desktop
early access reviewa 2d platform fighter where the best of the baddest warriors in history battle each other in an eternal tourney of champions for bragging rights infinite mead and the pure pleasure of delivering a beatdown includes online four player free for all custom games and local play options a version of smash bros with an original lore and a lot of characters to chose definitly a good option to play with friends or alone
somebody once told me the world is gonna roll mei aint the sharpest tool in the shedshe was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumbin the shape of an l on her foreheadwell the years start coming and they dont stop comingfed to the rules and i hit the ground runningdidnt make sense not to live for funyour brain gets smart but your head gets dumbso much to do so much to seeso whats wrong with taking the back streets youll never know if you dont goyoull never shine if you dont glow
great game bad comunity community there is awful just poor parenting sex craved kids who cant do anything but hack or bad mouth about anything they hack in this game so dam much and kog isnt doing anything about it even if youve reported them i know this cause iv reported a lot before and only the p2w players are never banned also this is the only game i can think of who trash talks about black people a lot
do you like dungeons and dragons do you like playing online with friends and random strangers are you okay with your friends not actually playing and getting stuck with random strangers for manditory party missions if you said yes to all of the above then this is the game for youthis game being part of the dd franchise stays true to the universe and respectful to the source material
"dota two is a multiplayer game though you can play against bots there are two teams of five players the radiant and the dire each player picks from a list of many characters each with a different set of abilities the two teams start on opposing sides of the map theres only one map in the game each team has a base area in which resides an ancient from each base creeps these autonomous npc creatures spawn periodically in waves and start a journey towards the other teams base towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit the goal for each team is to destroy the other teams ancient while defending their own hence defense of the ancients sounds simple but theres a lot more to it than this imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other meeting somewhere in the middle of the map where they will fight again they do this automatically without any player input the creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out the next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over or theyll reach a tower and get smashed by it and the cycle will continue basically nothing will happen the game will not end because the creeps cant get anywhere now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps he can attack the enemy creeps and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map knocking down towers along the way eventually hell get to the enemy ancient and be able to destroy it but if just one enemy player comes out to meet him the teams will be more evenly matched and it comes down to a player versus player pvp scenario the pvp is of course the heart of the game it is of a high level of complexity the learning curve is quite steep making it challenging for noobs which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what i will euphemistically call short tempered people one player who doesnt know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team the complexity comes from two main parts first the sheer number of selectable characters in the game at the time of writing there are one hundred and two characters with more added periodically as the game is updated each character has four different abilities sometimes more that are active requiring the user to press something to make them go or passive they just operate automatically the abilities are characterspecific though there are common elements between them some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience after youve done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them consider that in addition to that there are over one hundred and twenty different items that you can equip your character with items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones again they are active or passive in nature oh yeah each game takes a long time to finish around fortyfive minutes is pretty common you will never get away with saying ill just have a quick game of dota to your significant other at least not once theyve put up with you playing it a few times so learning curve big one time investment or sink if you prefer big one especially when youre trying to play with other people and theyre abusing you for not knowing what youre doing but the real question is is it worth it ive clocked up almost four hundred games and theres still some characters i havent played im not turning pro any time soon but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals my win rate is about fifty which seems to be fairly normal losing is often traumatic especially after youve lost a couple of long four thousand, five hundred and sixty minute games in a row or youre saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots or just bad but the games that are good theyre really good with so many combinations and different ways to exploit them the level of satisfaction when youre playing with friends and manage to coordinate a fiveperson push on a tower laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities wiping out the other team well thats what keeps me coming back for more not only that but once youve invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps its genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations there are always new builds to try and new items to buy ive gone through several favourite characters depending on which new ones ive played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates even after around four hundred hours of gametime i still have more to explore i do however only really enjoy playing the game with my friends ive tried a few games solo just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service and i find this massively less fun its less engaging because i typically dont like to communicate with randoms via voice and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased ive had good games with randoms but generally dont bother playing unless my mates are online as with all reviews this one attempts to help answer the question should i buy this game well good news dota two is free it has just come out of a long inviteonly beta period so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero but there are two big questions you need to ask yourself one can i justify the amount of time i need to get decent at this game before i start enjoying it make no mistake the learning process for this game is an ordeal if youre prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty maybe ten games then thats a good start if youve got mates that are happy to babysit you then thats good but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means theyll be losing a lot while youre still struggling with the basics the best way to approach it is to read some guides i recommend welcome to dota you suck and play with bots until you can beat them on hard reliably with one character then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status and play some games online with them the more friends the better if youre matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant2 why is it free i seriously can play this without paying anything dota two is built on the freemium model its free to play and you can purchase ingame items for money by giving the game away valve hope to make more money selling ingame items than if theyd charged for the game this is an increasing trend so get used to seeing it more especially for games with a strong network effect i e anything with multiplayer the things you can buy for dota two are basically adornments for the characters for example you can outfit them with new armour or a new sword or some new spell effects that are different from the stockstandard one that they come with you can get some of these for free theyll randomly drop at the end of games but the good ones for your preferred characters youll have to shell out for its very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all you cant pay money for a new sword that does more damage it just looks different this is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly paytowin thing if youre a content creator you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store splitting revenue with valve"
early access reviewi was ok with most of the updates over the past year however the no driver s seat no tiered armor cubes has made the game to simplistic for me people complaining about good players building and designing machines that were superior frustrated me a good game will have many different facets and layers to it freejam has removed those facets making the game unintresting but hey now the most basic of intelligence and thought will do well in this game
dont waste your life on this its addicting but the devs only concern is making money they dont care what you think and they will push you to buy the bigger better tanks and planes through sheer frustration alone dont waste your time getting addicted to it its really not worth your time and money im jumping ship because i cant take it any more
feels clunky looks clunky has huge depth for hardcore minmax players but offers nothing for me that i cant get out of the other games in the genre cant argue on the price so go test it out yourself and see if its your cup of tea
what can i say i always loved yugioh anime and played games on ps2 and pc the game itself is not bad visual effects could be better but it doesnt matter the worst thing about this game is matchmaking and the duel time is shortened you litteraly attact with one monster two times and you winlose thats it you dont even have time to activeate two spellstraps in the same game
early access reviewthis is pretty much a free game with a mixture of csgo and cod but for a free game i would highly recommend it the only thing i would want them to implement is australiaoceania servers but other than that great game
early access reviewthis is a very early access game the developers of this game cares about it they will change the game according to the community demands but as of right now i dont recommend playing the game for enjoymentwill change my rating when i see some major feature improvements
early access reviewwell first of all this game is a giant blend between inhales cs go battlefield cod and rss exhales the best thing about this game that it has the elements of the above stated games but hey its completely free the only drawback that this game is kinda paytowin you either gotta grind a ton or spend a ton trash community tho
controls are good looks good not that expensive but damn the small portion of players who are just playing bumper cars make it unplayable there is no way to kick them so dont recommend play lfs or something
early access reviewenter gamewtf is this main menuenter matchwtf this is pretty good graphicsget killed by random guy with full armor play one more game find bunkers with machineguns find car exit betterthanpubg exe such a great game with allot of potential
hate the update700 is worse than the previous version the bot is ing stupid they keep taking the courier all over the world and im fed up with this game now probably not gonna play this game anymoreand please do not forget to nerf the ing ape king
early access reviewthere was once a time when everyone lived in c t then epic loot attackededit i really did give this update a try but i really cant get over the new currency and the crates it feels like fj is going for a cash grab and i feel like i can no longer make any cash while playing the game really all they need to do is remove the crates or make currency gainable through matches but untill then i can no longer support this game now here is sum lenny ʖ you thought there was more
this is a free to play public game my friends want me to play and i played this game for five years as a married and working man listen me guys i played mainly support or roamer and what i see is fifteen funny gameswin or lose rest is get flamed after lose or see commend me guys type of guys if your team wins what i say is this is a great game absolitely good game but you know lots of the players wants to be satisfied else then gameplay and fun i decided not to pick support and see what happens and it was all chaos and flamemaybe on my mmr im not high mmr player im not pro but everyone is here is miracle or rtz yes sometimes people say it my bad and sorry if you dont have nothing else to do then uninstall this game and you will find a thing to do this is just waste of time if you dont make money of this game just play it and count how many times it makes you happy or upset i know ill miss this game becasue its the best 5v5 game in the world for me but somehow you find yourself in mmr race and aim to go high do your best and win but somehow not fun you play it for the win win wi n win or flame or flamed even if you say someone really nicely hey come lets go there do this you are getting flamed eighty five percent on my mmr so this is a very very good game but we are not that good as humans it seems i even saw my lifetime friends flaming and arguing each other for this game so this is not for me have fun in mmr race if you play this game just think about why people put money in it and try to increase players number its all about player community and money they make why you release a free to play game
early access reviewthis is one of the best fps i have played in a long time with time i have no part of my mind that says this can not be better than any call of duty made with this said even though it being in early access and free to play this is on my list of the best games i have ever played with most dislikes of the game come from grinding and nade spam the grinding part is not as bad as everyone says it is i believe this is from people putting enough time to enjoy the game i see the people that complain about grinding have two thousand and thirty hours most of the time although i can agree the nade spam is a problem but you need to see past all of this to enjoy any game with installing this game most wonder if it is even worth the space it takes and with it being early access makes people skip over the game when they see it with almost playing three hundred at the moment and most of it being a free to play i can say this game is not pay two win i believe people dont realize most of the people paying money in game are the ones that have hours on hours on playing this game and they dont have a more powerful weapon than you they just have skill the come with experience i strongly believe this is a game with great community while this review is all over the place i know i wrote it i recommend this game to anyone that is willing to give it the try it needs over the months i have shown people the ropes of the game and if you see this review and want to learn how to play just add me thekunz11 in my in game name if im online dont even think twice about it ask me what ever you want to ask i want this amazing community to grow and help the average new person as well with all that said im allowing comments if anyone to ask questions there or even give their criticism on how bad this review is
early access reviewits ok i guess if you looking for a casual mmo its heavy instanced though since its a mobile port done right and the questsstory its a bit general for an rpg
the only game in the universe with more nonsense unskippable tutorials than quake champions requires that you sign up to roughly ten different third party clients installs an endless array of middleware runs poorly and half the screens covered in popups and trash that you cant close move or reposition1010 installing this was a mistake
early access reviewbarely able to level up if you dont follow the exact path youre supposed to its fun but its very limited if you dont follow it by the actual story story is kind of lame and keeps you from grinding
this game is pretty much your average freetoplay gong show you finds on the internet not just on steam and after learning about trion telemtry bin being in the new files before installing i can safely say that the developers behind trove and the lazy at trion themsaelves can go themselves to all corner of their infinitely boring contentlimited paytowin as corporatism game world anything i could possibly a nd moan about has already been covered so i wont bother but do not download this ing game i do not support illegal activities such as spyware you have been warned trion and you trion fasti i ing dare your stupid to do something about me fuxcking dare you you do not claim that a leigitimat epiece of spyware is a false positive when it is anything but i dont know about anyone else here but ive frigging had enough of aaa developers making bottomofthebarrel trash the only good game of any kind to come out in recent years have been the doom reboot tales of zesteria and and thats pretty much it so trion if you are going to treat new players like well you too since you dont need a new player we can easily head elsewhere perhaps to a freetoplay title where players are actually i dont know respected cough grey havens cough
early access reviewits good if you have firends to play with me personaly i played with only one firend it has seemed like its inproved ten fold since closed beta monsters are geting close to aqw level but i have two little things that bug me though first off some of the near maxlevel crafting can take six hours to complet but it contuinus the countdown while not in the game now second i felt like i got to near max level a littel to fast i cant wait to see what the game will be like in two years
the update seven hundred why valve why we loved dota because it wasn t lol now it is like lol graphic is now horrible and cartoonish map is complete trash poor roshan moved hud looks unbelievably lame and lollike lot s of the game customisations like the character panel ingame is now uselless well pity for players who bough them the shop in game is now stupid you can t just see all items or write a few letters to find one you want now it shows only recomended if you want other you need to click to little wheel to see it horrible the fountains is that a joke okay don t mind them for example somewhere around the second towers maybe but if they are right next to the middle it will just destroy the whole gameplay why the hell always so pretty and complex dota looks like as some mobile moba like mobile legends eve nthe design and graphic dota is now like a fuking android and ios game yuckalso the new hero wtf is that it is definitely like a lol hero has six skills all very powerfull it s kinda like he has six ultimates of other heroes and i don t even mention the fact that his base stats are pretty good too the new map layout suits him perfectly so he can do whatewer he wants and kill everyone with ease now with trees everywhere and the distance he can do it there is no place on the map far enough for him to not be able to jump on a tree pros special stats increasing at certain levels upgrading of skills is easier now just one clickcons new hudnew heronew map layoutnew graphicsnew neutral on a lame positiondaynight clock designnew hero picking stuff is it dota or mortal combat update 700valve valve valve i don t know what kind of weed you had but guys throw it away it s spoiled

i hate mobas i tried lol dota and several other lesser known games i picked this up earlier this month and immediately became addicted my friends who hate mobas as much as i do also became addicted we now have our own small clan and play this game daily not sure what it is about the change of perspective from isometric clicktomove to third person wasd controls that makes such a difference to me but now i can say i genuinely enjoy a moba the community isnt quite as toxic either so thats a plus
early access reviewa fun and engaging game with lots of possibilities even though it is still in early access and is set to be free to play once it launches i have not regretted spending money on it as i have had my moneys worth of entertainment build explore farm and have fun even though i do not like comparing it to minecraft there really is no way to avoid it if you enjoyed minecraft you should check out creativerse it is minecraft with a lot more atmosphere and style and even though the is similar it just feels like creativerse has an extra punch to it
early access review tag above this is a lie geme used to b good between twenty fourteens two thousand and fifteen later updates basically f it in so many ways for one that wonders why dfq does this guy have 287h on record well i used to pley when i had git god time back in the actual early access fyi they keept that tag only to lure in new players so they can make more money on their update oh btwhave you heard of a game called nether yes nether ive already uninstalled it id say robocraft has become just like it no wtf is nether well let me tell you its a game where the developers didnt listen to the fanbasecommunity when the game had great potential for future updates guess what1 devs got gready2 fans got mad3 devs abandoned the game4 fans abondoned the game5 some fans stuck around and prayed they would recieve a blessing from god6 devs came back released a new patch with a new game mode7 remaining fans realized it wasnt a blessing gave it a shot anyways8 regetted everything when satan appeared on the screen and took your soul so he could fuel the games canabalistic hunger conclusion dont waste your time here unless they revert to a earlier patch lets say when they first introduced megabots the only reason to why this game is rated mostly positive is because it used to be good really good back in the days of actual early access
early access reviewgreat game with a good veteran player community that wants to help new players learn the game while the game has some issues it is still under development and the devs are pretty good at fixing major issues they are also committed to bring regular updates to the game that adds features and are quick to modify the new features based on player feedback if needed all in all nine hundred hours of fun and counting
good combat straight forward gameplay move right to proceed makes it easy to find fights and keep up with enemies around your level most of the paid items are cosmetic aside from character slots and unfortunately action bar upgrades but its not entirely paytowin
early access reviewdecent br better than pubg in my opinion needs some changes one being you need to be able to shoot while vaulting over something not just be a bullet sponge this is only getting a thumbs up because you can snowboard and do flips
i love this game played the freegame which was more than satisfying good for kids and adults updates bring new skills and blocks and bug fixes the new blueprint builds are excellent so many talented people out there that put my rubbish build attempts in the shade so thanks to you clever peeps d my son bought the pro version for me my birthday this last august thanks son three hundred and thirty three i love it even more with the extra perks pro brings so give it a try its fun go lose yourselves for a little in your own world full of unexplored adventure thanks playful for creativerse
it is really great to have this game on my computer everythings is very smooth and pretty duel links itself is great and it really is a blessing i can have it on my computer now without using an android emulator
"early access reviewgreat great game except there is network problem sometimes much more balanced than hearthstone strongly recommended if you like card game that require no luck but mind power80100 while it can be rated ninety thousand, one hundred if its without those network issues"
off its true this game has premium planes ships and tanks now that we have that out of the way i assure you premium vehicles means absolutely nothing with when talking about ingame effectiveness i will now only talk about tanks as its what i mainly play this game for as far as mechanics go its simple aim and shoot short barrels have to compensate and long ones dont if you get hit and the proyectile damages your crew badly you might have to stand still for a bit as you have to swap whoever is still alive even if you are standing in the middle of nowhere same if you get your trackstires or engine hit if your cannon is hit you might not be able to shoot until you repair it any free tank can devastate a premium one with ease hell a fast reserve tank can kill high level tanks before they can realise what is happening tanks are mostly very agile too even antitanks i sometimes take my stugs into a game to drift for a while and flank enemies they shouldnt be played like that it also feels really satisfying to one shot an enemy that just realised was in danger and was about to run off i also have to say two more thingsfirst one is these kind of games are for a very specific consumer not made for everyone i thought it wasnt made for me either until i tried it out second one is that the first tanks you will encounter will be a bother to try and driveshoot but itll get much better a few vehicles in
this game looks nice and feels nice just like the race seven but with better graphics the tracks and cars in this game are extremely expensive almost five euros for some tracks and three cars for ten euros unless they lower the prices this game doesnt appel to me too much there are five free cars and two tracks pretty lame and the tracks at least are extremely boring not real tracks and again if you want hockenheinmring or monza you have to pay real money overall nine hundred and ten great gameplaysimulation but the content that makes this game exciting is very expensive
this game is really great bots perform extremely realistic almost eliminating the point in playing vs real humans bots will ignore you when you ping a hero just like humansbots will steal your farm just like humansbots will 1v5 the enemy just like humansbots will ignore enemies taking roshan just like humansbots will not ward just like humans supposedly this has been fixed1010
this game is awesome for gun nuts countless hours i have some complaints though it cna be a bit janky to navigate the game but you get used to italso getting a new gun to play with is super overpriced and the pay to win isnt worth it so you cant even really pay to advance either and not because its not an option but because its too expensive i get the point is to really get all the achjievements for each gun and truuly learn it but for some guns you are getting every achievment and not even getting a return back so you have to go and redo it a hundred times after the achievments to get xp and advance regardless i think it is a great game with countless of hours to it plenty of challenge and variety if this countinues to add more and more weapons that would be great
so this game is so garbage yugioh is fun but for some reason duel links is buggy as crap if i play a trap card it bugs out if i win a game and after i get my rewards im stuck on a a screen and can only alt f4 to get out of it i went to duel a friend to see if that at least would work but it also bugged out after he ended his turn and on my end it showed he did not so we got stuck doing nothing and again only way out was alt f4
yesterday i played about four games in the new dota and guess what i do not feel this dota i do not feel this cybersport thank icefrog you destroyed all that was dear to menow is not dota this is lol icefrog trying to increase diversity but it turned out that he made the game even easier but dota has always been famous for its complexity ive deleted it and perhaps gabe come to its senses and return us to the good old dota not thisâ â â â â â
i rate planetside two very well even though theres like a very steep learning curve its a well detailed game with three warring factions against one another to tatically take over four contients by using six different classes and nine different and unique vehicles there are many weapons class perks equipment vehicle perks and many items to unlock by killing enemies and taking over territories and most importantly the game is free for all d unless if you want to be a member by paying some money per month
this game is the greatest t ever seen i played without steam for 200h so i have experiencethe history about issnewz fredaikis is owner of newz and he was the one who destroyed the iss game with his gratis cheats on me after destroying iss he bought the iss license lol question for the community would you sell the game to the guy that destroyed your game so sergey titovcreator of iss did it i assume fredaikis and sergey titov worked together all the time or somthing is very wrong with sergey negative pay to win one hundred inaccurat aimeveryone can see you when you spawnyou are still loading the game but other players can see you at the map wtfanti cheat engine for kidsgame freezesserver crashing all the fkn timeits funny when you play battleroyal p and you are the third last guycharacter movement rly strangeif you play the game alone you will never win because other player are in a groupspawn places rly strange because the map is big but you will spawn next to each other loldevs have no idea of programming maybe they can write hello world in ten different languages but nothing elsepositive at the moment nothingconclusion never buy anything that was made by fredaikis or sergey titovhammerpoint interactivepublisher arktos entertainment because this guys work like a mafia
only skill is needed unlike the rest of the f2p moba games you can find on the net cant really go wrong with that other games force you to pay for heroes even the community is total cancer though but one could say the same for every other online game in existence just watch your wallet the shinies in this will eat through it faster than a hungry hamster in a pile of sunflower seeds
early access reviewif your tired of playing call of duty or battlefield and wanna get that old battlefield nineteen fortythrees feel well this is it this game is a wonderfull ww2 game that will not stop developing well of course till every major faction is added but this game focuses on everyone cooperating into finishing the job of capturing territory including different roles in order to support one another also there will be times when you are pretty much out gunned like this for example germans have air supporttigersinf while allies would have inflight tanksrecon but that makes the game challenging and forces you to storm on a plan and work together with people as a team
early access reviewso i bought the american sniper recently i bought it only for the scope id checked out for a while i have never purchased anything in a free to play game before this is the only time i have ever spent money on something like this and of coarse i get screwed over in the most recent update they decided to take that scope away from me you now have to buy the recon class to be able to use the scope which ive already owned by giving them real money you couldcan buy that very same rifle for a much more reasonble pricegrind i am now stuck with a rifle that costed me alot more than it would have if id purchased it today scopelessthis so called recon class costs twenty i am not buying something ive already owned i am very disappointed with how the developers skrewed me over like this they sell something to you takes it away repackage it in a different form then sells it again for a much higher price the greed is strong with this one but for a game that is free it is worth playing its a lot of fun just be careful how much money you spend in these sorts of games
i use to really enjoy this game seriouslyit was absolutely amazing that is until the squad update came in and ruined everything basically everything in the game is unbalanced this game is a pay to win i had high hopes for this game to be an amazing world war two fps
a fairly decent time waster at this point its literally just a clicker game to me as i spend a few minutes clicking on everyones stats in s p e c i a l rooms to raise them and move the maxed stats dwellers around give it a few more days and all one hundred and ninetythree dwellers will have one hundred special stats if you like fallout or feel reminiscent and want to waste away a bit of time this is the game for you
lets be clear the full game costs five hundred and this number will climb rapidly over time do not buy in in or you will just continue to encourage the pay to buy cards buisness model that compromises balance and player enjoyment to squeeze as much cash from players as they can tolerate believe it or not it would be possible to make a strategic card game that respects the player and prioritizes game balance and player enjoyment too bad it will never happen because players keep giving in and funding this abusive buisness model the usual trickle of daily quests disrespects the player by urging them to form a habit of logging in to get a pittance of gold balance isnt as bad as some other card games but it wont be long before youll get hopelessly stomped by players using decks you could never make without dropping a significant chunk of cash
wrote a review at the point where the game is starting to slow down this game wasnt a waiting simulater it was a lot of clicking managing stuff to try and be as efficient as possible now however i see times becoming longer and prices becoming higher just a warning had fun until now though
early access review update ever churchill inglorious guns get ton of bug asuf h tank hit tree and explosion phanther g dead with one hit panzer and ur tank if get hit totally no damage sound from one hundred zero life in one hit on hellcat or e8 i play over 1000hour and u update like this goodbye hng delete it from my library and last one inside ton of spwan kill with mines ur tank spwan location ing good well beta excuse
pro good if u into oldschool yugioh playstyle no xyz pendulum syncro and other stuff yet cons lazy porting this whole software still designed for mobile there is even no max windows button literally you could call this emulator not a pc version harder than dark souls because i got auto lose for almost every ranked or kc duels because some of connection problem while i have decent and stable connection and in terms of games u only got three fields for monster spell trap cards instead of five dw seems useless for me why you bother dueling ai who cant fight back stage quest would be good too if we didnt have to duel many pointless battle even with auto dueling prefer to duel twenty three games against good ai than many games with auto dueling like thatwell cant complaint more since its free to play and i dont really mind about micro selling in free games would recommend if atleast technical problem got solved and have pc friendly user interfaces
early access reviewnormally i dont write reviews but this game deserved one from me even tho it is in alpha the in depth system of it is absolutely amazing ive never played a alpha game that was so smooth so fun and addicting its kind of like a space moba but extremely ballanced all you need to know is your ship classes what they all are good against and a good tactic i mean come one who dosent want to get into a intense dogfight just to find out your the last one left with three enemies surrounding you waiting to jump you but lets face it you get so into it when you hit your thruster out of there sight behind a astroid with no hull left but some tin foil and some rockets speeding at your face while warping out then makeing the jump back home just to go back out and fight this game has so much potential not only do you choose your ship but some awesome badass crew you can hire and put on your ship with catchy phrases soldi cant wait until the developers add more to this game its golden theres so many ideas you can put into this game to keep it the great game it is i wish i could be on there development team myself thats how great there doing with it but yes i do recommend it and this is a game i wll always come on to play i want to get more people into it and hopefully see others to warp right ontop of them and tackle them before they can even put there jump drive on and if the developers are happening to read this keep going its just amazing what you have created and always remember to keep it nice and ballanced just how it is hopefully i will see you all in game and let your bodies float around the cold cosmos
super unique and fun game definitely worth a try i mean itâ s f2p so you may as well and yes i do have more hours than whatever i have on steam i prefer launching the game itself instead of doing it through steam
early access reviewgreat game has very good graphics loading time beats pubg and plays smooth only thing that i dont like to much is the viewing distance you have to get pretty close to see someone even with a sniper and you should be able to see them easily especially in snow please dont just have one map like the rest of the battle royale games make another one or two and add more weapons
after some time playing it meh this game has a lot of problems gotta take a break from ita few weaks later oooh a new leaguea week into the new league this is the best arpg everthats the gist of it if you like diablolike games play it dont get overwhelmed let it sink in but stick to it you will love it once you get bored take a break come back a month later and fall in love again would absolutly recommend
free to play pay to enjoyid read that somewhere on thehunters official forums and the summary resonated with me at some thirty hours played with that said its incredible two notes on this work one there are few games with better gunplay and two it is the best hunting game simulator available thehunter has it all unfortunately most of the content is gated want to hunt mallards well youre going to need to buy a set of decoys a blind and a nice shotgun in addition to the license win boar hunting tournaments that demands use of a hog feeder and the feed in addition to a tree stand for an optimal experience and thats the key optimal you do not need anything other than the permitted gun ammo and license to hunt a particular animal however youll have to work much harder to win competitions or have a successful hunt if none of this seems like it will dissuade you and youve some cash to make your experience easier its well worth the value for what you get
i rather like how this game goes people complaining about having to be glued to your screen not true just simply save and exit your game and you can come back in nineteen hours and it will only have depleted alittle and you can gather all your stuff i really love this game
early access reviewi own source and go and i still think this game is fun sure it might be a knock off but its sure fun to play for and giggles i mean the guns are stupid op and the movement is pretty jank the point of games is to have fun and i think people would have more fun playing a glitchy game and laughing at the random stuff that happens in it rather than a less glitchy game with better gameplay overall its just too much fun to run around and knife people in the face or awp them from unfair spots
this game is so sloppy thats the best word i can think of for it takes forever to start up and closes on connection error horrible has the profoundly stupid choose a faction and one of the mostlyfactionunique races that are also highly restricted in class choice system please remove this from all future mmos forever after the clumsy and rushed tutorial any keys you rebound will revert and you will lose the skill line the tutorial had you equip without any indication that anything changed until you suddenly notice the framerate is atrocious and takes massive drops in certain areas for no clear reason this affects your ability to type coherently the combat system is roundabout and unintuitive to absolutely zero benefit other than just to be different half of your skill bar is constant nonchaining and the other half is dynamic chaining you can equip two chaining skill lines and swap them each hotkey on the active chaining line is actually a combo starter that you continue with r its a cool idea but implemented atrociously all of the characters are shall we say impaired not only is the full voice acting very awkward and misses the proper intonation of basically every single sentence but the sentences themselves are written in a strange nonconversational whimsical grammar stew that is confusing and baffling this has the effect of making the entire game story a confusing surreal fever dream the autopath does not account in any way for dynamic terrain so your character will happily walk off of moving platforms and ruin the autopath completely certain quests dont tell you what youre supposed to do for instance i just took an airship as part of a quest with no indication of where to go on the airship i had to hunt on the map and compare the quests details to figure out the correct destination i then had to wait like five minutes for the airship to physically travel there in real time and with loading screens
they are ing up the entire game and it seems they are going down a pay to win path paid modifications for tanks seriously used to be fun but now they dont listen to the community
early access reviewthe game is very enjoyable for the price of thirty you do not need to buy the forty or one hundred and fifty all the more expensive ones just give you are skins the game is not pay to play and will not be the developers are working hard on fixing all the bugs more so then other games

best strategic card game you can built your own card strategy also money or premium player doesnt effect to your fun gam gives u to chance to earn soul gems and golds also drop events in stream totally free to play fun and challenge but some cards so op and some opponents play their turn so slowly on purpose and waiting you to quit
early access reviewinitially this game was very fun but the epic loot update has effectively killed any interest that i may have had in it this game has devolved into people finding weird ways to mitigate damage through exploiting how some of the shapes work and destroyed any sense of creativity making art builds completely pointless and uneffective having to disenchant items and use that dust to create new parts was a dumb direction to take this game its an awful lot like how hearthstone lets you destroycraft new cards
early access reviewwhy would you hate on this game pros amazing graphicssuicidal thoughtsbroken screen from ragingmakes you find new interests like how to tie a hangingsman noosebut there are some bad things too brgarbageautistic csgoyoure hackinggives you one hundred chance of diabeteslike literally the only positive reviews on this games are meant to be taken as a joke
early access reviewokay so first of all this is a new game and a free game we have seen a lot of free games on steam and we know how bad they can be i know that the battle royale genre is getting a little bit out of hand right know but i can genuenly say that this game is fun especially when you play it with friends so try it what are you waiting for its definetly worth it
r3e was absolutely terrible not so long ago the interface was a nightmare and the racing odd with the huge coloured markers etc if you judge it on that let me tell you that its now a completely different game the interface now makes sense and is one of the best youll find out there the game is f2p with purchases for content but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy there are frequent sales so you dont have to spend a fortune cars are very impressive with the physics being better than iracing project cars and assetto corsa but not quite as good as rfactor two tracks while not laser scanned are not too far off the quality of rf2s nonlaserscanned tracks the geometry is generally accurate but of course you dont get the exact bumps but laser scans quickly become out of date so this isnt as big an issue as one might expect sounds are the best youll find anywhere really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car netcode needs a bit of work cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen but multiplayer is in alpha i believe so hopefully thatll improve in time the usual issues of only thirty finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer singleplayer features the most enjoyable ai ive raced against in short r3e is vastly better than it was and now deserves a place among the elite of simracing
early access reviewan interesting game but what kills it for me is the fact this game installes a tool called gaijin net on your pc which is not uninstalled when the game is uninstalled theres no uninstaller for it so you have to research how to remove it further research ha revealed its a torrent seeder which is identified by my av as malware re the response from the developer the game was uninstalled through steam which is how all games should be installeduninstalled if obtained through steam i would also argue that any updates should be deployed through steam and not a third party application if gaijin net is not a malicious software contact sophos to let them know
pay2win business model like clash of clans where if you spend more money the faster you advance obtain a higher advantage compared to other players that dont spend money on this game at the moment this game is dead this may also be caused by the extremely long queue times when the game just came out which has driven away many potential players but of course that was last time oh how the mighty has fallen
thank you for destroying the game r i p heroes generals 20142017awesome game destroyed by cheter and stupid devs that dose to this gameevry new update they somthing they never lissen to players what they whant just trow random that are usless and even more unbalancecomunity is toxic as hell telling anything that is wrong with game u get your self a banned from it because moderetors that watch post ban evrything they dont like they use their powers little too much they are an idiots i never seen so many guys banned from it was reading post evry second guy that post thatt there is somthing wrong with game or suck get insta ban from it the guy that doing that is deadman nice job kiddou can find much better game then this evrything u whant or love in game prepare to get nerfedthis game not worth spending any cash or time with it i wish i could ask for refund or just sell acc and get out of this trust me guys i have alot of hours and i promise u this game had good potential but when money sucking es and retard moderetors get into this game its just whent to hell and i am not insulitng anyone just saying the truth that guys maybe will read and maybe start playing and they need to know how big this game isthere is the truth abaut whole game editworst support ever losing whole day at fixing their game because they are usless they wont respond to ticket hopefully they will after one week losing veteran and fixing the game by my selfnew update after one year and guess what one hundred and twelve update they up ptrd tank balance light tanks can kill tiger two and all planes are unbalance recon planes are dominating sky unstall and looking for new gamefrom best to worst ww2 game on steam in two updates nie job retro moto u did goodi think its worst company i saw in years of playing any gammes and i think they should quit their job or sell a game to some maybe normal company or just giveaway for free they suck major d
awful 210unfair matchmakingafks unoptimised graphicscall of duty two had better graphics than this gamethis game should stay on mobilematches last like ten secondseasy to upgrade your tankboring
early access reviewi was bored on fortnite and bugs in pubg are really pain in the then i finally found this its really good battle royale and i think it can go big like fortnite or pubg there are little inovations like snowboard glider or climbing and devs are listening to communitythere are some bugs but nothing game breaking but i want raw input and be able to change resolution in fullscreen devs please add these things
early access reviewive been a fan of space flight games for some years now and this one is right at the top of the list great game and simple to jump into and start playing when new to the game and then dip into for a quick battle here and there or to say goodby to an eveningthe emphasis is on teamwork and is cruitial to whether you win or are defeated what is nice is that whether playing with an basic ship or an all singing all dancing upgraded ship no one can simply destroy an opponent in one or two hits making the game playable across levels upgrades are simple to understand and easy to achieve if players are bold enough during game play to earn them and the bonus points on offer each time you play although it is in alpha deveopment there is already a strong range of ships from the mennacing usr flag ship to the small tital corvette each with a role that has no less of a function than others get it and love it
early access reviewim a long time player of aes games and after knowing of what they do i can sayyes they do have their blunders and their strokes of genius aq3d is unfinished and probably never will be since its updates will besimilar to their other games where they never actually end right now the game is very unfinished but they are progressing towards a new unique game unlike many others id recommend this game to anyone who likes a game they can continue to come back to since there will always besomething to actually come back to that is new
well its fun but it wont let me play anymore in the sand box mode you cant have weaponry witch can make it borring and it iss allmost imposible to turn wepons on and there are so little things to fly its basicly flying a few times then you get bored because there should be a few free mor things so yeah add more free items and people will play more
a clever little game for all the parttime fallout fans out there this game is a timesuck with very little pay off there is some strategy to the game but is ultimately the same there is very little replay value once you get past the initial unlockings which you can accomplish in a day if you try the only story here is the one that is in your head with all these negatives its still free and occasionally fun but still cant give it a thumbs up because they want you to spend money on random drops
early access reviewfor a free game it is worth it maps are a little small and theres not to many guns but thats actually the best part of this game the simplicity my only complaint is the headshot hitbox is probably over fifty of the character model rating 810edit after the last couple of updates there is less people playing and even more hackers to the point it is now unplayable
good but not complete it focuses more on the old school players me xd and does not include the xyz tuners etc this uses the speed format im not complaining about it i like it but i wish there are other available format options since this game was originally a mobile game the graphics suck for pc they should rework the graphics for pc this will have to satisfy my nostalgia for now until they create the complete yugioh experience for pc
this game how can i describe it is an above average game do note i said above average not wonderful or perfect since it is riddled with problems first the community ever since the game has first been released publicaly especially to steam the community has began to die down more and more people carrying their incompetence is spreading like a disease but even so there is still many people veterans who are still friendly and ready to help out our fellow gamers the forums of war thunder is a rather friendly place if you follow the rules or the moderators will start bannin second the gameplay the gameplay is very good but for the most hardened pilots isnt enough the flightmodels are just inaccurate damage models are tweaked against their historic counterpart and many many more but even so i believe the gameplay can compensate for this problem finally the economy hufff with many other reviews and posts complaining about the grind of this game i must disagree with the the grind is really really damn long but it helps you too it makes you learn your aircraft become part of it and also the game doesnt owe you anything its a free to play it also isnt a paytowin game as the premium aircraft are more so regular planes thats either lendlease captured or just prototypes but later on in the game you might have to buy premium to succeed and not waste your entire summer break grinding dat highesttier f86 in conclusion the game is a rather nice to waste and spend your time on though it has its problems sometimes you have to get over it all in all i can recommend this game to anyone who loves airplanes or tanks and the soon ships ddddd
grandchase was way better than this game this game is boring as and pvp system is dumb when the enemy is too good you cant even move no more this game sucks bring grandchase back even more fun this game is fckin broken this game kog grandchase four life
"dont let steam hours fool you ive been playing this since beta on the normal client i literally downloaded this on steam just to throw my two cents in ill just say this if you enjoy other mobas youll most likely enjoy smite that being said the game is undergoing a major shift and the developers are jumping ship theyre going from hirezexample employee name to titanexample employee name this is being used to distinguish between the two groups of hirez one is project titan and the other is simply hirez you can expect the eventual dropping of the original devs to the new ones half of the problems that the game is currently facing is due to inconsistency ill explain most players whether theyre new or old can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent this being that you can queue for a match and if youre lucky enough to get in and not you are unable to be matched and are now the highest queue which literally resets your queue for another one thousand and fifteen minutes if youre lucky to get in youll see one of two things one or multiple people on your team that are exceedingly lowlevel and shouldnt be in your games or one or more enemies that are lowlevel and shouldnt be in your games either way its simply not enjoyable roflstomping some poor guy thats a lowlevel when he shouldnt be in your game isnt fun for anyone its not fun for him and its not fun for me and it actually has a high chance of running new players away matchmaking inconsistency is more often than not the cause for playerfrustration ive been playing since the beta and im burned out i played literally ten games in a row and literally had trash players on my team that threw the game i should never be paired with less than 120s thats sloppy matchmaking playing with friends should be fun ive played countless hours with friends and one design flaw remains whomever queues for the game and is the party leader rules the matchmaking im normally the party leader and we typically get players between one hundred thousand, one hundred and sixty aside from the lowlevels we get teamed with and while this is fine we have a few players that are new and have difficulty keeping up with players that are one hundred so to remedy this well have our lowlevel player host and queue for matches and thats where it becomes apparent that the matchmaking is literal trash because if he queues the party we go up against players that are his level not mine hirez claims that the match making takes the cumulative level of the party and matchmakingrating and queues them with the players closest to themselves well we just proved thats so now were in a game with players under thirty and im one hundred and thirty so i have two options i can roflstomp these lowlevel players or i can hang back and let them experience the game i dont want to throw the game for us but i dont want to be that player thats farming lowbies thats not fun for anyone and i want the player base to keep growing not shrinking godclass favoritism is rampant you can clearly see which godsclasses are favored more than any of them just by looking at the numbers there are currently ninetyeight gods out of those ninety eight there are twentynine mages twenty assassins eighteen hunters fourteen warriors and seventeen guardians mages are the most overpowered and thusly the most played there are mages that are so ridiculous you cant close the gap to actually get to them this can be seen with gods like ah puch discordia baron nox zeus vulcan etc its exceedingly rare that mages are bad however there are many gods that are simply in a terrible state such as ratatoskr pele artio terra jing wei nike osiris etc part of this issue is that hirez balances gods strictly around conquest their main mode the funny thing is most people dont play conquest they play arena and assault to this end the game is unbalanced severely you jump into an assault which is a 5v5 with random gods across the board and you fight an ah puch youre basically screwed he can keep more pressure on you than most players can get around if your team doesnt get a mage youre basically screwed gods like pele are fantastic in conquest shes designed to be a jungler and is the current best jungler out that being said on any other mode besides conquest shes utter trash this is part of a major problem for smite balancing the game for a mode that most people dont play as admitted too by hirez execs doesnt work it leads to people quitting due to frustration when all they want to do is play the damned game and have fun which is what games are supposed to be smite is literally flooded with t cosmetics that do nothing but take space in chests to prevent you from actually getting the skin you want you have one god skins two ward skins three avatars four loading frames five pedestals six social emotes seven recall skins eight hud themes nine loading screen backgrounds ten jump stamps eleven fountain skins twelve levelup skins thirteen death marks fourteen titles fifteen music themes sixteen announcer packs seventeen vgs voice packsand you can bet your that all of these are filled the the brim with absolute trash that you dont want but is just there as filler for chests hirez is incredibly greedy and literally throws cosmetics in the way to make you spend more gemsreal world money on you dont want just so you can maybe get the skin you want i cant prove it but im certain that chests are rigged so you only get the good skins at the end of the chests to put it simply if you pay two hundred gems for one chest rolls youll most likely get and seeing as there are mostly fiftyfive items in one chest youre going to be shelling out a ton of money just to maybe get the skin you want this needs to be changed the sheer greed of hirez shows in literally everything they do these are only a few of the problems there are so many bugs and issues in this game its absolutely insane in its current state i would not recommend anyone plays this unless youre interested in subpar games and shoddy matches miserysimulator2018"
if youre looking for a balanced game this is not the game for you match making balance is the worst aspect of this game and you would think it would be otherwise if you like playing against different era vehicles which outclass you in every way possible then this is the game for you it gets pretty t real ing fast when youre in ww2 era fighting the coldwar era it gets real grindy as well to research new vehicles most of the time youre on the end of the stick but every now and then you hold the stick and even then if youre team is incompetent dont expect much from others its a lovehate relationship with this game
early access reviewthis game is a bad rendition of counterstrike but its really a rather fun shooter just something to waste time on really my bet though is that it wont have a good player base within a month
pleaseee make new colors only purchaseable with mammoth coins and also make the three vs three friendly mode a thing not just brawl of the week plus make free for all mode winner to who did most damage omgggg
early access reviewthis game is so awesome i cannot wait to see the finished result please make things a bit cheaper we all work hard to play games and enjoy them online it is expensive and if we cannot afford to we cannot support the developers
long running game but if you have never played it definately worth a shot the progression in the game is very lateral so mechanically the advantage a veteran can have over you is minimal and while early on you find fights to be a big mess once you learn a few of the basics and join squads tactics start to outstrip the raw numbers the starting gun is perfectly viable as the gun to use for the entire game and anything else just specialises into a specific role while having drawbacks if you do try it for the first time i would heavily suggest a support role until you understand the flow of the game frontline can be very unforgiving but there is a place for any player even if your aim is terrible the downside is if you prefer the lone wolf approach the learning curve to make that viable is huge as well as a very user unfriendly ui menu system
ok lets get this straight i love this game the only reason i would have to not like it is the fact that it is so hard to get kur the currencywithout a membership therfore it is very difficult to purchase weapons and attachments other than that i absolutely love the game from the large scale battles where you can get pinned to one location its just adreniline pumping and if you capture a base it can be takken from you by one of the three factions so you actually need more people than the two other factions to actually secure the location so all in all i would rate this game a eight hundred and ten eight mainly like i said the fact that it is very hard to get money without membership

early access reviewthe game has gone completely downhill since the expansion being a unique card game that may be aluring for the prospect that the mana you ramp with is also a card in your hand that is rng that being said the game introduced many cards incouraging aggro play which doesnt need to ramp but just kill your opponent in four turns the heavyness of the rng that punishes intelligent and strategic gameplay and rewards mindless vanilla idiots not recommended for sanity reasons play hearthstone or something
early access reviewpurchased founders due to a lot of the promises that came from the dev and emissaries around what they were going to do differently in this region none of these promises were true you basically have emissaries who are either fanboysliars and people now who know the truth and are speaking up about it i thought it was very odd they were not doing a beta event or any sort of testing in this region and this is why performance is abysmal on 1700x and vega sixtyfour gets sometimes fifteen fps in towns and can barely reach sixty other times translation is horrendous and you are going to have no idea what your moves do this is nothing more than a cash grab dont do it and stay with another mmo i appreciate steam for honoring the refund for a broken game and the devs lieing to the players
please even if you want this for your kids or you just like dragons stay away this game pratically is impossible to enjoy for players who dont pay nearly â one hundred for a membership you start off with two dragons a rumblehorn free adult dragon for fetch quests and the one you hatch i will admit the colour customizer is pretty neat but thats where that stops all dragons apart from the whispering death egg you get for free later in the game you have to pay for you need gems to buy dragons the main selling point is locked behind a paywall as you cannot earn gems for free the gameplay is boring controls are bad and worse of all all of the quests are fetch or ask questions or those god damned hypothesis quests i will admit tho you can earn free stuff that costs gems by using coin chests randomly appearing chests that have a price of ninety coins one hundred and sixty coins they have a whopping two to give you a dragon egg and a measly fifty to give you a â â â â â â item to decorate that poor excuse for a farm village rip off save your time save your memory card space and more importantly keep your kids away from your credit card
early access reviewi love the game but maybe you should add a thing where you can actually set the graphics to low or medium cause it is kinda unfair for people who dont have good graphics

truly a timeless masterpiece no matter how badly valve tries to kill it please be warned the addiction its too much for any mortal man please i beg you look at how much time ive wasted on this war based hat simulator sharon please theyre my kids too i promise ill play less sobbing
if youre looking for fun dont ever play this game it used to be way more simple and cool now it is just tryhards and people who doesnt even try to have some fun playing they just want to win even if the game is not a ranked match always the same picks on the same games invoker broke the game and is probably picked in five every eight matches and win on four of them dota two not reborn was way better and balanced it is also infested with smurfs dont be surprised if you just started playing and you see someone with three hundred and forty two kd on your match not that its a problem for old players that use to smurf a lot nowdays but it kinda make new players forfeit playing this game for its so hard to have a match against people that actually started playing even though i think you should give it a try if you get used to these problems its a very good game and pretty addicting but i think i just had enough
early access reviewsome aspects of the game are appealing including the large variety of vehicles however when it boils down to it the blatantly pay2win business model alienating anyone who doesnt whip out their credit card and floaty gunplay make this game only worth a bit of fun with friends rather than something youd pour a lot of free time into
"uh oh looks like something went wrong this the game please reload v one thousand, seven hundred and forty two still in beta october 2018no problem where are the saves https steamcommunity right no recovery"
path of exile now this is what all freetoplay games should be like path of exile was the first game ive ever played for pc considering i just got my pc and i am new to pc gaming i am extremely impressed on how this game is the community is very helpful wonderful and extremely nice pros beautiful graphics stunning mechanics amazing community not paytowin guilds massive skill tree voice acting ui and ainpcs are amazing variety of itemsweaponsarmor etccons its kind of a hard learning curve no more cons i can listwhen i first downloaded this game and started playing i was confused because there was no guidence to help me its a bit of a tough game to get use to in the start but whats you get the hang of it its actually very fun i chose not to write any more pros because its too much to write and i figured you guys should try it out for yourself now what i adore about this game is that you can have any weaponarmoritem you want no matter what class you choose you can especially have two weapons i play as the ranger so if im in a tough situation i just switch over to my melee weapon you need to download and play this game please give it a try one million ten
early access reviewnedoporučuji tuto hru je to sice zábavná oddychovka ale hitboxy jsou příšerné jednou vás týpek zabije na one hit s full armorem ale týpka bez armoru na one ránu nezabijete nedoporučuji
yet again another s h i t design cancer infected card game fun at first until you only face the same op cards exploit in your opponent hand say bye to skill and strategy the only way to win becomes to buylose enough to gather the resources to craft the same op c r a p you face endlessly and pray for the luck to draw it first what a concept i personnaly hate it but youre ok with that go ahead have fun nb its not like those where rookies errors from beginner designer the umbalance is obvious they know it but thats how you make people spend money in booster pack steve jobs and hitler would be proud
unfortunatley i must say a true about this game the graphic from two thousand and sixs year optimalisation non exist who the hell invent to put high resoultion textures and effect to so old engine game run on dx9 this engine even dont use more than twelve cores of the cpu you can have nasa pc and the game still wanna lag and fps will drop because this use only twelve cores gameis ugly so many bugs so many glitches gameplay is stick and boring world is empty this game is no worth playing even for free i have 64gb of ram 2xcpus 12cores twentyfour threads 24mb l3 gtx ten seventys 8gb and game even after reduce some efects to medium or low still drop under 15fps sometimes much lags and freezes
its a great game but once you get everything unless you are very creative to do stuff on your own or you have a community of people to build with this game becomes very boring and it pains me to say this even if i bought every single dlc and recipe pack in the game looking forward for the next big thing that creativerse has to offer so that i can come back to it and get hooked one more time i want adventures in my own world i want that rare items become even rarer i want to work hard in order to have everything i want rather than to just keep chests full of every item but i still love the game
early access reviewwall of text inbound great game amazing game i love this game to pieces at least i used to the game was awesome up until recently than crates arrived actually i shouldnt blame one update i suppose if i were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment id have to point my finger at the introduction of the crf this feature which id like to say was nice in concept intensified an already present issue within robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today the crf allowed for the rapid deployment of op bots or rather exploitative builds im going to use the tesseract as an example while not a huge issue on its own it is the way freejam went about resolving this issue that made matters worse to any veteran of the game that had some knowledge of the problem the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective a more complex fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the builds armor sadly freejam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1but three now two but still weapons designed to deal with these builds while the build was successful in their intended task they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it this isnt a review whining about badly balanced aa though so onto the next nail shortly after this fiasco fj introduced epic loot a system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins nine times out of ten instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire they are now forced to test their luck with crates crates that logically fail to reward a player common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot this makes sense the crates fj has forced upon us do not follow such logic high tier crates rarely reward suitable loot in fact it would appear from my experience that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a players efforts this is ing stupid period theres also the complaint regarding the premium row flaunting items however this hasnt really annoyed me as much as others moving on to the big one a lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this games downfall if every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole they wouldnt come close to overtaking this issue as simple as this problem is it is so bad in fjs case the simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge that someone looking in from the outside would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customers to vent why no devs will respond with exception of drognin but its his job as community manager and we love him for it three the devs that have a proper power over the games development use twitter instead of their own forums its dumb anyway as if this wasnt long enough ill quickly list the pros and cons of the game so tldr pros one builders may be entertained if they get good stuff two not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap cons one devs are usually silent unless theyre being praised two balance weapons what are those three exploitmeta builds everywhere creativity doessnt seem to be a major concern to fj four hope you enjoy gambling i really like this game but sadly i cant recommend it to anyone because for one youre not rewarded for and the devs dont seem to intent on fixing the issues
alright to start off let me just say that this game was actually the first moba i played in my entire life i never really played any at all previously but this one caught my eye due to the mythology its an easy game once you get used to it a little more appealing than some of the other games out there like dota or league of legends no matter how much they tell you otherwise this game takes a little concentration but after a while youll get used to it and no doubt enjoy it pros wide variety of mythological characters to fit your playstyle gamemodes are easy and fun to play addicting always adding more and more items and gods into the game no need to pay anything in the game everything is free unless you want to boost yourself and buy some gems to help out not only you but hirez cons teamwork is needed but you dont always get it in public matches some gods need obvious nerfs some gods need obvious buffs occasional server lagissues the amount of badmouthing from other players is immense overall id play this game with a few friends going into public matches tend to lead to bad teammates constantly badmouthing and being a general annoyance but the gameplay and variety makes up for it in the longhaul i definately recommend this game to anyone interested in a good and wellpaced moba
early access reviewi have played this game for about thirteen years and theyve added awesome things to change the game but now it doesnt have the awesome gameplay aspects it use to have because they made it a pay to play type game when they added the epic loot update the game just isnt what it used to be now so i cant recommend this game like i used to to my friends like i said the other updates were awesome but this update completely changed the game in a bad way for the players who have played this game from the beginning
well smite is moba game that came ou in twenty twelves and in twenty fifteens got onto steam this time its all about myhtological gods and it positions itself as moba that has the third person style gameplay instead of feeling like warcraft three leftover and yea they kept updating it shame that nu wa isnt snake babe anymore though nothing that cost money seems to affect gameplay unless unlocking gods the game also comes with easy anticheat with set me off at first after all its offered separately on steam just for counterstrike where it often conflicts with valve vac and also takes screenshots of your desktop apparently it does it only for cs and everybody else is safe at least it closes properly when you close smite aha antiviruses may not like it when installing and setting up the game though and well i thought thats its just going to be a generic moba with a camera slapped behind the characters but nope while there isnt much of difference when playing melee attack characters still being able to hit just one single target and all anything ranged is a different story you actually have to aim this alone makes it much better than dota alikes as far as i care there are no warcraft three magically homing projectiles at least for normal attacks the abilities also have various hit areas whether a circle or a line as example there is this neith who has mighty jiggle physics and best ever victory animation her first ability is penetrative arrow first you have have to aim this line down and use the ability after that neith will aim the bow now allowing you to change the angle anymore however you are still free to move and thus you are still able to reposition yourself in order to hit the target of course enemy players arent afraid of strafing you slow down when attacking so watch out plus a lot of abilities are rather smart being something simple yet with multiple usage such as ice elemental tankie golem thing being able to create ice wall having a long range to set it up also the game has jumping but its just a silly animation for those who feel bothered not being able to jump when controlling the characters directly developers dont want it to affect gameplay unless exploits or bugs the terrain is all flat anyway the game also includes the auto features for both shopping and selecting ability on level up the latter isnt that much needed the auto shopping on another hand helps new players to just focus on interacting with others and fighting when they arent sure if game is worth of their time spending looking at all the stats and numerical details pretty great albeit of course its not as good as manual build otherwise of course it still has that moba feel it still has towers and creeps running along lanes the combat flow is still pretty funny in a silly sense at one moment players are attempting to poke each other at range and then in another situtaion they all gang up on each other and nuke area with ability spam in ten seconds but hey the game also comes with many various modes usual moba big map with three lanes the two lanes one one lane with small sideways a simple linear path which has random heroes selectable about as dumb as deathmatch modes in team games and a small arena mode something for everyones taste otherwise yep the only moba i shall care about so far even if its not pure moba so that means that i still sorta dont like mobas but hey whatcha gonna do also music rocks
strangely addictive not much to the game but one you can have on in the background as you watch tv updates all the time so always something new one of those games you just have to beat recommend to all who dont want anything to taxing
early access reviewthis game is sack of its poorly optimised badly designed and you literally cant uninstall it properly maybe if they werent so shady with their business practices i wouldnt have been so aggressive but seriously whoever made this game
the moment i started playing i got addicted to the game i would recommend this game to everyone the legends designs are amazing the work that has been put into every weapon and legend is incredible
prospretty graphicsgood combat mechanicseverywhere you can find people so you dont feel lonely in any areastory is good and makes you want to play more and quests are challenging undead for the watch3many classesconsoh boythe system requirements are a lie i perfectly meet the system requirements but i cant play comfortably even tho i got the graphics at lowthe game is really unbalanced in pvp modethe magegenerally mage classes is overpowered as hellits nearly impossible to get the best weaponsarmor in the game because you need lose your life by grinding all day longtoo many ingame currencieswhen i first played i was completely overwhelmed from the many currencies that are into the game i got really confused and felt utterly stupidthe worst con is the fact that the developers focus only on how they will make money by making only new content when there are many things needed to be fixedi am pretty sure my review is nothing different from the other negative reviews but i felt like i should write my review and express my own opinion about this gamei personally give this game a 4510even though pros were more than the conscons had a significant impact on the game and made it unenjoyablethanks for your time
great game its my second day playing it and its just awesome i love it i really recomend this game to any videogame players boys or girls for the first time i saw it before like one year i tough its totaly crap just kind of cartoon style fps with bad controls but actually its better than cod modern warfare 2plus it got voice chat so you can chat with your friends and it too got normal chat i love trading items from this game with friends love this game
early access reviewhello playersi might be a bit biased in this review and no offence to the developers but the game sucks i could have given it a positive review a year ago before the update before it was clear tiers people played with people who are the same tier as them and the game was more or less balanced i mean there was at least some balance of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you even if they killed you that was fair enough you cold just face it and you could see by their blocks colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them the update messed up the game now textures were removed colours for each tier block where removed and what yo can colour your mark ten tier ten blocks white and everybody will attack you and you just rek them also before gc galaxy cash had a higher value you could buy a megabot for like five dollars gc or could build a boog t7 for ten euros like super mega tier seven or prebuilt magabot now the cheapest crappest robot costs thirty euros like a call of duty or gta v game tier system was messed up now worst players play with best players da hell your like t6 and a wild megabot appears from somewhere and wrecks you lol if you think differently comment sorry for biased opinion yoursanton
i downloaded this game just to say how much it sucks also i been waiting four hours now for it to come out of maintenance anyways all the positive reviews are from fake accounts just check for yourself also not pay to win then why do they offer micro transactions that offer a slight boost to leveling last i knew thats pay to win if you pay real money and level faster what a joke this game is trash chane my mind
most amazing combat flight simulator but overpriced i wont buy a plane for sixty euros are u f u c c k i n n g crazy i can buy two games instead a nice priced game put down the price do not be a jerk
path of exile has been almost nonstop fun since i picked it up in closed beta at the end of two thousand and eleven ive put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit steam if you like diablo you will likely enjoy poe this is the spiritual successor to diablo two prepare yourself though this isnt as simple as diablo three and requires a lot more planning thought and testing to have an effective build math of exile is a game where you afk in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how youre going to set up your future passive skill points the mechanics of combat damage and character resources health mana energy shield armor etc are very well thought out and make for strong arpg combat as a spiritual successor to the diablo line should be early game the first nineteen levels has a little more variety than d3 per character but after level nineteen your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills provided you can get them from a master or another player or find them as drops gameplay is varied but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running grs over and over i personally find poes grind more fun because theres more i can do while grinding and theres a large active community in each league and i can chat and get responses and conversations at any time overall its a modern diablo two experience with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than d2 but in each respect is more rewarding than d3s more loot less gameplay twist on the diablo recipe you will be tested and you will be found wanting just try to survive edit how many expansions in are we now four four free expansions three of which are more content rich than the d2 expansion and all of which have more content than diablo 3s xpac seriously give this game a go its free its fun its awesome
early access revieweven though i give this game a seven hundred and ten its not too bad the only prolbem i have is the leveling system i know its only in beta but i checked their site so at least they are listening to people
the game diablo three should have been when you look at path of exiles with its small team of developers and at least when they started the limited amount of cash they must have had and then you look at blizzard with their war chest and you compare diablo three and poe and you can clearly see how much better game this one is the only microtransactions are for cosmetics you sometimes wonder how this people even eat i have 40hrs because i jump from game to game like a grasshopper but the 40hrs ive put into this game ive enjoyed every bit of it
early access reviewabsolutely loving the game especially like the true free to play aspects where grinding earns you a great amout of cards and gold every format from ai to pvp is a blast and every game feel meaningful as you build your collection highly recommend if you are sick of hearthstones rng then make the switch to eternal today it really is the best of mtg and hs combined
this is one of the rare few times i will write a serious review so read carefully trove is a ver addicting game with countless hours of gameplay even though i only have thirty hours into trove i highly recommend it if you like adventure games now lets move to pros and cons show we pros a very fun and addicting game that is actually free to playitem gear rankings the higher the gear the better once you get to uber one and above its a every time legendary very smooth frames and fun gameplay mechanicseach class is something new not just a recycled concept which can lead to hours of fun gameplayno pvp which means no overpowered uber five players kick new players arses in combatclub worlds create a club and a club world where only you and your friends can hang and build togethereach dungeon is equal meaning that a pirate biome dungeon isnt harder then a cursed vale dungeon biomeshadow levels increase you level from the max of twenty cons the game can get very tedious grinding for fluxthe game can also be very tedious trying to get a legendary or higher if you dont improve your magic findyou must pay attention to the tutorial or you will get very lost mid gamealthough they are fixing this queue times are very long on weekends due to weekend trafficif you run out of potions mid battle with a dungeon boss your screwedcorner stones can be hard to find at timesyou have to mine for materials to make new portals to uber one and abovemushroomsi find that challenging dungeons at uber three and bove can prove to be very difficult at timeswings dont come to you early and are quite hard to obtainyou are stuck to one class and cannot change unless you collect cubits daily or spend in game currency final thoughts trove is a very fun game and i highly recommend it while it may seem that some of my cons are a bit bias or even very true the game has a lot of pros that will make up for them its also worth mentioning the game never once puts you in a postion that makes it seem like spending real life money is a must if you like singleplayer open world adventure games or even a multiplayer play with your friends game then trove is the game for you also i personally recomend the neon ninja and the shadow hunter for beginners but mostly neon ninja if you like to be up in the front lines shadow hunter is a ranged class requires more brainpower and strategy
ive returned to the game after the big recent patch and i am really enjoying it again i hadnt played for quite a while before rejoining probably a year plus immediately after the patch there was a problem dragging cards which has now been patched you seem to need to drag them by the bottom half but meh easy enough to make that mental change until they fix it fully which im sure they will great gameplay can play a quick game or two for twenty minutes or lose hours in it seems resonably balanced most cards have counters if you build a deck with some thought you can ponder over card combinations for many hours too without even playing a handjust honestly cant see the hate is deserved turn that frown upside down barf the devs of course need to take into account the feelings of players and im sure they will and give it a month or two to get patched back up and i hope that mostly negative in recent reviews will turn positive i love the clever emote system too though it is a tiny tad limited would be good to see that expanded a bit so anyhow i look forward to seeing you in game where i will kill you without mercy but will make sure i do it politely
"got to say it is a pretty good and little adicktive game great for a quick play or long sessions one thing ive noticed since using a ultrawide two thousand, five hundred and sixty x one thousand and eighty is to try and aviod zoomiing out too far and then moving the map it tends to freak out and dissappear it will come back when you zoom back in"
truly this game is the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of idleclicker games i will start by saying this the game mechanic is fun and the game itself is enjoyable the team formatting is unique and diverse that being said this game represents all of the unbridled greed that game developers seem to find themselves filled with these days in terms of raw microtransaction cost this game is the most expensive game on the market in addition this game has been out for quite some time on kongregate com prior to being released on steam as a game developer i find kongregate to be a great community and ive enjoyed seeing other titles such as adventure capitalist time clickers and clicker heroes make amazing transitions over to the steam community the same can not be said for this game why all the aforementioned titles all had one thing in common if you spent money on ingame microtransactions on kongregate all of those bonuses carried over to the steam platform players were given the ability to export their save game code and then import it once on steam even for idleclicker games that are only on kongregate this is common practice at this point it has become an expected best practices within the industry crusaders of the lost idols does not do this kongregate users have been calling for ages for the ability to importexport save codes even moreso once it was announced that this title would be being released on steam users repeatedly reached out to the developers attempting to make contact with them the devs were silent for over four months finally one day the devs decided to finally appease the masses and actually engage themselves with their community thats when we all discovered the awful truth the devs were simply trying to rob their players the developers announced they were making the concious choice to refuse data transfers to players in their community who spent real money on ingame bonuses spent fifty on chests when the game was first released on kongregateonly well you dont get to keep those bonuses better spend another fifty if you want all your perks again eh while i have not ever spent money on this game and have thus not lost out due to this i find this to be one of the most unethical decisions i have seen a noneablizzard game developer make it undermines the entire indie community despite the fun gameplay due to the underhandedness of the developers i would advise everyone to avoid this game and not support it heck since its free to play install it then downvote it with a review players and consumers in general need to take a stand against greedy developers like code name
"early access reviewits early access but the graphics are dingy you have tons of hackers lag absolute crap for weapon balance insanely low recoilspread even cod has more combat feels shallow and uninspired needs a ton of work to even be fun especially to be matched with people who actually speak english or live anywhere near to the states overall rating three thousand, five hundred and ten would not recommend"
early access reviewfor ingamei only have minor problem so far but after i disconnected from ingame ive been stuck forever at forty when i try to relaunch the gamei gave up so i decided to refund this game
early access reviewa throroughly enjoyable game to play alone and with friends i can imagine this would be brilliant at partys for people with very little gaming experience the game isnt endlessly playable but is very enjoyable indeed despite this i can see this isnt a game for some people but give it a try it is free
flaming cliffs three is a good module to get you started in the game simple to use and iconic aircraft make sure you have a hotas setup anything from the cheaper thrustmaster t16000m up to a thrustmaster warthog works fine also you need either a trackir or nofacetrackir ps3 camera or something to track your head movement not a game for someone who is not an aviation enthuasist you really need to understand some basics of kinematics and pulsedoppler radar the game kind of teaches you a little bit but your better off learning via youtube all in all though this is hands down the best combat flight simulator available to civilian consumers on the market but not for those that are looking for an arcade experience
early access reviewthe game itself has alot of potentials but recent changes epic loot update indicate the developer lacks foresight in looking after the player base significant changes e g ninety nine drop in income were pushed out just like that without being tested e g in a test server when asked for justification the developer simply stated the changes were fair and balanced whereas some players would go into detail on how they are not the improper management of the game development drives this game backward
"early access reviewgreat idea solid game solid graphics for f2p only problem is the two thousand, five hundred and thirty minutes wait time for matchmaking which is a bummer because this game actually has solid potentional"
ok so i download this game despite the3000 and some odd number of negative reviews and to my surprise there it is not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buys but a pay to win then after three or so months pay to win again as soon as i loaded the game up the first screen that pops up is the purchase screen so this tells me that this is nothing but a milk machine for the skeezy developers that made this and once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hands and a camera so upon further investigation of the getting a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the launcher to get equipped with something so i knew that being a free to player i wouldnt get the best but i got the absolute worst i got some crappy gun that looks like it was textured in ps2 era and i still have to buy ammo which costs ingame currency so i go to buy some and nope i got no starting cash so basically it was trying to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for a free gun i feel like this should be labeled as a bad game and taken off steam due to the three thousand some odd number negative reviews saying it was a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people i am going to try and contact the developers to see if i did something wrong and how i can fix it and i might change my review
early access reviewthis game is actually very good its still in alpha but the performance is ok theres a decent amount of ships and the battles are alot of fun once you figured out the mechanics and the controls currently theres only one map and one gamemode but its still loads of fun playing dont be discouraged if you get wrecked during your first few games it will take a little time until you know when to engage and when to run probably the most important skill in this gameand equal mix of tactics and piloting skill is key to success
early access reviewgames is pretty much unplayable you take quest quest mob is spawned you kill it then server acknowledge that you have taken the quest and require you to kill a mob that is slain due to it being sotry q you canno retake it have fun deleting your character
so first i started playing trove back in twenty fourteens and i personally really enjoyed it im a man of all kind of games and i assure you if you are into grinding and you arent very effected by repetitivity then i would reccomend it however if you arent i would not recommend it but i started trying the game again in twenty eighteens and i really enjoyed it i hit a thousand hours and maxed out numerous characters got all the dragons spend roughly twenty five and i enjoyed the experience i recommend
worst pay2win shooting game how it works join a game attempt to kill someone and get sniped you have to pay money to unlock weapons then you have to spend much more money to buy the weapon money isnt easily obtained in the game go try ghost in the shell or warface better
this game is pay to win how you ask well let me just say this i was playing my first casual joust match when i noticed a character was flying above me he then landed on me and killed me with some finger pistols or some apparently it was the god apollo i thought huh that kinda seems unfair theres a god that can just fly above you in this game and become completely untargetable thats so ing t but i let it slide mind you apollo is not even a default god and you need a currency called gems to buy gods in this game there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money so after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods ao kuang thanatos and guess who get again yep you guessed it apollo i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that but to top it off ao kuang and thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and theres no way to escape it you just instantly die and it heals ao kuang and then he can fly away and do even more damage so after my teammate got eaten by an ao kuang which then landed on me killing me i just uninstalled none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money oh yeah and before i even started playing theres some gods they released that they didnt even finish causing massive balance issues such as hel artio and ullr they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game if hirez fixes these things i will make my review positive but as if now i can not reccomend this game tldr pay to win game with no updates since twenty fourteens after devs abandoned the game dead community and extreme balance issues
early access reviewretro fps once we fix the hackers and cheats this could be a little gem it takes me back to old fps style which i like and this is free so you dont have anything to lose just your time
early access reviewafter playing this game for thirtynine hours i can honestly say this game is incredible its a perfect break from the hearraising firstperson shooters that we all know and love after playing for a awhile i have learned that there is no one character that is better than the other but rather characters that each have their strengths and weaknesses ive played for thirtynine hours and ill play for thirtynine more i highly recommend this game its too much fun
the game mechanics and ranking is completely broken the same people play at the same time every day so people are in skill bubbles for the time that they play furthered by the game being free so people smurf on low level accounts and two people matched togeather low ranking even if one of the people is a high rank this completely destorys the ranked game modes and makes it unplayable anyone who says this game has a scene is lying if you are used to being thirteen hundreds at 4pm gg at 3am totally not the same skill level getting elo up is a hell not worth the time all the new chars are released overpowered on purpose and cost extra coins this isnt a one time thing and completely breaks game until they decide to fix it furthermore all the mechanics are focus around how your char is broken based on what weapon they have some do autolocking attacks other have auto combos some spam hard others charge half way across the map in one attack this isnt real mechancis this is just a bunch of gamebreaking things thrown togeather some chars will always lose to others based on the moves they are given each char with the same weapon pretty much plays the exact same the way the button layouts work it is very hard to use some of the attacks since they are tied into your mouse and keyboard directional keys most people just cry spammer when they are killed even though half the chars are designed to be spammers some chars you never see people play because they cant handle being autolocked the hitboxes are awful and some chars have no combos
early access reviewring of elysiumroe is one of the best battle royale games i have played i really like the aspect of classes being involved in a game like this all three of the classes are very fun and very helpful to the game recommended the game to all my friends and all of them love it see a lot of potential
a word of warning purchasing the f18c alone without the flaming cliffs three purchase does not include tutorials on how to fly the plane however its easy and you dont have a job so youtube it worththe su russian jet that comes free is a terrible example of the game because its bad thats why its free just bought the f18c and the game is fun now if youre an a10 warthog fan like me just be aware there are different versions one is a simplified variant the other for people who dont have jobs like you so you should be finerght shift lrght homerght alt homelft ctrl c page up x3zzzxxxzzhold w page up hold afterburnersrelease wtake to the skiesrush b but seriously this game is excellent
definitely one of the best clicker games ive ever played i bought all the things to support the developers that give me a few benefits but it feels like my progression might be sped up a bit too much with these bonusses i know i can turn them off but then it feels like a waste of money when you ascend and you have all those bonusses you can skip a huge amount of time every single time if you just start out you also get as much progress in no time as someone who didnt start out with those bonusses i had played this for about five days without bonusses my friend bought the bonusses and was instantly on my progress so i also bought them all in all a very good indepth clicker game that id recommend to anyone just wish the bonusses from buying the extra things werent so insane
tf2 has been ruined by this recent update hopefully valve will bring back the old tf2 someday tf2 was amazing already newest update ruined it i mean like seriously why do you need competitive for casual cant we have fun without the confusing update the community wants the old tf2 back
i am a long time player of smite i have one thousand hours offrecord gametime and for me smite is the master race of mobas but every patch has become a nightmare i always get errors at launch and it got so bad that i havent been able to play it for the last two months and i even lost two already paid events during that time throwing fifty to thrashcant get a refund obvioussly crash report doesnt respond to me i am very furious i need help pls hirez do something about these errors i am tired of downloading and deleting smite every month
early access reviewhorrible launch very disappointed at their network engineers their outlook on have a solid optimization plan in effect while i understand that you can not predict everything launch being critical at ironing out the presenting issues of massive connections you can tell that the framework theyre using can not sustain the large player base this is an issue of ue3 at its core the framework they present to work along with the build of the game there is a reason proper made games focus on their netcode firstly take notice if they will have to reconstruct the game engine or build one from scratch all of these issues are as bright a day to see for everyone as a developer someone who tinkers with ue aside from what ive said earlier the game is still meh ive played jpkrru bless all of which still present to me that they have not even taken seriously to build their game enviornment basic shadersbasic materials assets almost feels like theyve made this game with the blueprint design feature ue offers and not a language the game enviornment feels empty and just basic as if someone just placed assets all over the world with no care and thats it skill usage still feels very basic although i would say much better than before the rebuild of the game ui clunky cheap feelings almost as if the ui is still a prototype such an awesome take on the mount system yet they mess it up with having a stamina system stamina goes down very quick jumping kills it so fast its ridiculous i dont know what the devs were thinking when they introduced this especially with the world being so big quality of skinseffects costumes isnt so bad i enjoyed it not much content to do really dungeons or monster quest killing is just about all youre really going to be doing besides pvp being end game which by the way i dont see be enjoyable with such performance and network issues over all this game is still so incomplete i would consider the state of this game alpha to prealpha bless after all the issues you have had you should be letting us play this game for free you should provide us with proof that your game is in a better state rather than charging us for packs pure sillyness i wasnt going to buy this game at all but i said why the heck not let me give the devs a chance well i did steam has now refunded me this game is not worth thirty or forty dollars i would say these issues wouldnt be too bad with a free release let us test the game for you good luck on future endevors bless im out
product received for freeearly access reviewi really do enjoy this game its fun for me but since recent updates the game has simply felt pay to win and whoever has more tanks wins no matter what
team fortress two a great game transformed over the years into a shape that i no longer recognise nor love having quit the game for around a year whilst still following updates what i say may seem harsh but i say it because tf2 may still have the potential to be a great game again in my opinion tf2 has been neglected lopsided balance and longexisting bugs left unaddressed for years whilst in recent months they have attempted to address such problems they ultimately left them too late visually the game has changed a lot mainly due to horrendous looking outlandish cosmetic items being added that didnt even try to match the original art style not forgetting the various visual changes that may be intentional or not that have also decreased the quality of how the game appears for example on older maps lighting is screwed up as are several decorative decals found on those maps that are now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release i dont want to list every issue like this as i understand they are likely this way due to either optimisation or updates to the source engine over the years that have caused such parts of the game to break the biggest nail in tf2s coffin for me was the removal of pubs in favour of an overwatchesque matchmaking system completely changing how the majority would play drop in and drop out was one of the major appeals for me and it is one of the defining reasons i quit this game the more casual atmosphere of pubs was enjoyable and the options for mvm and even competitive tf2center etc not the terrible competitive they did add were there for those looking for a more coordinated experience mvm was an enjoyable part of my playtime personally however as mentioned earlier the lopsided balance of tf2 was only amplified here whenever they did change weapon stats they completely forgot to consider any effect they would have on mvm should valve decide to allocate more staff to tf2 perhaps one day itll return to a state where i can safely say i love this game again however with the small handful that does work on tf2 this is rather unlikely
"started on armor games found it here for a desktop copy over twentyfive reincarnations and counting i probably have four thousand hours idling on this game but it says something like three hundred cause its been up another one thousand, six hundred now absolutely love the work done on this game and you can tell the team has passion for gaming as a priority in their design elegant simple yet subtley complex cant recommend it higher for an idle game since the only one that comes even close to this level of quality is the semiidle game shakes fidget"
dnd has grown up and it has aged well all the great mechanics of the wellesteemed tabletop rpg with the perks of any mmorpg i havent played neverwinter for that long but i know its gonna be great
early access reviewda wombo combo game of da centruy with next gen graphics surpassing call of dutis black oops three this game will soon be realeasd on xbox420 soon with the new character darude hitori
i would usually love this type of game but something about it maybe the fact that you have to just wait for hours at a time to farm money yeah its boring do not waist your time
i loved this game but a lot has changed since i first started playing back when i first made a review for this game but now sadly it is a grind to play from level six thousand and seventy its a shame they made it such a drag from six thousand and seventy when level one hundred and sixty was a breeze plus it is such a boring grind to get good gear now i worked so hard to get the demonic gear ive got which back then was one of the best armors to have but now when i play im weak i used to go into all areas and kill the monsters easily but now there is so many areas that are red because they are too difficult for me i really cant be bothered spending many many hours grinding for good gear again i still go back and play occasionally and i still like it but i cant play for the many hours at a time like i used to i get bored much quicker
i wish i could recommend this game if only you could jump on and assembledisassemble your gun of choice however you simply cannot you have to pay real monies to unlock guns like the m4 glock nineteen rem eight hundred and seventy and many others instead you start off tinkering with guns you may have no experience or expertise with for this reason i cannot recommend this game just charge ppl like ten for the game and include all guns stop the gun control
imagine that chess was only playable online and a single company was encharged of promotingsustaining it but suddenly that company decided to turn chess into checkers and you cannot ever play chess again surely it would only and obviously be a matter of adapting yourself to the new game right i mean chess is just like checkers if youre not capable of adapting yourself to it then there are no doubts that you are a bad chess player and you should resort to playing chinese checkers or monopoly this pretty much sums up what is happening to dota right now seven hundred is a big ƒück to your face if you enjoyed what the game was before it
"early access reviewfinally someone did a true magic the gathering hearthstone mixim an old time mtg player think one thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight and hearthstone legend player and i admit the game looks really fun heres what became apparent after a few games hearthstone influence battlegrounds look and feel the same lots of battlecry summon deathrattle entomb effects hero weapons mtg influence untargetted attacks blocks made by defender you have lands sigils creatures are healed at end of turn flying trample overwhelm instant effects played in other players turn mtgstyle mulligan p s i love the fact that you can use a for attackall wish hearthstone had something like this"
this game is fun even tho its pay2win since there are still some items that are earned not bought so i think this game still would be one of my favoirites compared to alot of other mmos
early access reviewblack squad plays out like csgo except faster with more weapons attachments and the ability to aim down sight basic mechanics like system etc are almost identitcal to csgos you run faster with your knife out and there is even a keybind for inspecting your weapon pros shooting feels good kills feel satisfying and meaty aim and reaction time are rewardedextremely sniperfriendly sniper rifles are significantly more powerful than the awp is in csgo extremely welloptimized 144hz supported very good graphics for a f2p game are superbvery playerfriendly f2p model vast majority of ingame weapons are easily obtainable with normal currencydecent maps people complaining about the small maps are talking about the deathmatch mapswide set of options decent builtin crosshair optimizationmultiple interesting and unique gamemodes defuse vip assassination etcbattleye anticheat is more robust than vacpretty good netcode hit registration seems very solid cons not enough weapons they will surely keep adding weaponsdeathmatch maps are too smallgrenade physicsrental system are worse than csgosno ranked competitive system this may come in the future play this game it could easily be fifteen dollars but its free
barring the ai this is a brilliant flight sim i see in all the negative reviews complaints about complex controls this is not arma where planes and helicopters model less than a quarter of the systems they have this is a realistic combat flight sim if you dont have a joystick you are not going to enjoy this sim note that even game mode is more realistic than arma to those who think this is just another free to play money grab each module has about the same amount of time put into them as each complete battlefield game maybe not combined armspros extremely detailed systems modelling for the a10c p51 and ka50 although controls can be frustrating without a trackir very high detail graphicswise free updates add to the sim as well as fix things the engine is also updated sometimes for more functionality very large range of vehicles and aircraft to fight againstcons poor ai without extensive scripting in the editor they overuse afterburner and run out of fuel when they reach their target mig31s enter dogfights rather than outrun their enemies ground units can see through forests and buildings helicopter gunships fly high when attacking and almost never hover etc some aircraft have lower resolution textures that look ugly virtually unplayable without a joystick but that is once again expected
early access reviewrealm royale at this stage has a lot going for it for anyone seeking more engaging battle royale games if you are not a fan of games like fortnite or battlegrounds this game probably isnt for you but if youre looking for more indepth gameplay interesting twists on the still burgeoning hallmarks of battle arenas and better map variety then you will certainly have fun with this game what makes it good uses of classes and abilities allows for variety of play each has their own basic mobility move while you can go out and hunt for more abilities that plays to the strengths of your class not only is it good variety but allows for coordination with teams and duosthe implementation of shards gives you good reason to keep searching chests and crates as you can go to the forge and make potions abilities and legendary armor for yourself the forge adds risk and additional objectives on the map potential hotspots for combat mounts and how easy it is to use them some people might not like the ability to quickly get across the map as it might detract from the use of the fog but i think it just speeds things up and allows for more expedient ways to get back into combat what needs improvement sworddagger play its a little unwieldy to swing a sword the animation doesnt look very good if youre gonna put in more melee weapons add some flair to the fighting style of it armory and shop nothing has been added yet as it is alpha but id really hate if it went like fortnite and put everything behind a damn paywall otherwise playing the game without it is useless and boringbetter skinned weapons some of them get really ugly
early access reviewthis game i installed because i wanted to meme it up with my friends in discord about playing this game this game was surprisingly entertaining and the people were really nice like super nice g8 game
"picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting especially being free i was wrong the developers put a lot of work into this game the models ingame are based on real world models every part is labeled with its correct name down to the smallest pins rollers and springs if you are detail oriented mechanicallyminded or simply curious this will be up your alleywhether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function check this game out i dont even consider this to be a game but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side there are pay aspects but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns such as military vehicles race cars even skeletons etc as for progression within the gun world its free the game consists of assembly dis assembly function games including a firing range and even painting the firearms you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can without hasty clicks and without errors for extra points its very challenging and im adept at this using actual firearms the xray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm even while firing reloading safety onoff etc this is what i liked the most about it in the real world one can take apart an actual gun learn the names of the parts and understand the basic functions but to see the pieces in action while inside the gun gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together the models are pretty good looking too they arent super high res but they arent lowres either my only two complaints with this game the way one moves around the gunparts to get a different angle is awkward sometimes frustrating but its not gamebreaking bad not by any means just an annoyance at times some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldnt be for example the ak47 one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the riflebutt before removing the riflebutt in real life the game penalizes the player if the pouch isnt removed first though this problem is more of a developers attitude of you have to follow my procedure even if its not necessary in the real world this is not gamebreaking either but very frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors overall i would recommend this game one hundred thousand, nine hundred and ten"
best a10 simulator as real pilot told us today i believe him its really the best simulator but hard to learn too thats why its a best warplane simulator but there are minuses too tanks can drive trough the buildings for example in real world building collapses or something but not here but off course its a plane simulator first not a tank simulator
"early access reviewthe game was so nice i dont know why people keep giving negative reviews but theres still alots of bugs and the mechanics of this game was so hard overall this game is nice seven thousand, three hundred and ten"
a fascinating and extremely interesting and as the name implies creative sandbox game it goes to show that the people at playful corp really put a lot of love into this game as it is in constant development and always expanding creativerse does have its limitations there are occasional technical challenges to overcome but overall the experience is great and the community support for solving problems is very considerate i can only see good things to come with all the options and beautiful blocks and devices and such that they are continually introducing its enough to keep your imagination and creativity sparked for thousands of gaming hours two thumbs up for this sandbox game
early access reviewive enjoyed creativerse quite a bit from earning my way to newer and better recipes to actually having to go above ground for some materials its kept me hooked i also like the free servers and that you can set your world to just people you want to have in itvia password i hope the free servers stick around and that when it goes to f2p the microtransactions dont hinder actual gameplay this is a great game now and can only keep going i think keep up the good work playful corporation
dress up in your favorite colour as each soldier on the battlefield has an identity crysis as to who they are empty your wallets as the next wacky cosmetic comes out bear rage as the opposing faction outnumbers you in every battle find yourself battling on indar seventy of the time you play this game fly in detriment as ace pilots dominate the skies base design tactics youre out of luck if you want to find a good leader step up and do what other people wont the only thing truly worth station cash are the bundles dont let smedley trick you in this isnt a review this is commentary only hope the game gets a tad bit better each month
the storyline was alright but not really that engaging its pwe game so its p2w the character creation is basic classes are basic with very limited weapon and armor selection
early access reviewthe game is great but id like to tell you my opinion then give you a overall summary some of the ships look like they are covered in foil and are all glittery which is kinda wierd not much in the way of upgrades and its impossible to customize the ships in any way the crew members sound wierd i thought i would be able to actually command a fleet of ships like at least twenty at the same time in a game but i can only use one and dont get me wrong its fun but its just knda underwhelmingoverall i would give this game a six out of ten mainly because customization and upgrading arent great at the moment and would like to see alot more variety and if they could add some more ships that would be even better
where do i start well first of all its a simulator i knew that i wouldnt go shoot twenty deer in two minutes but holy ive played the game for more than sixty minutes and i couldnt kill anything after i started the game i found myself running up a hill for ten minutesrunning because you run like30 faster than you walk and you walk really slow when i got there i found some poop and a red arrow above it wich pointed me to a direction where something should have been after another ten minutes of following poop trails i finaly found a wild boar when i looked through my rifle scope and aimed at the animal it said you need a license to hunt this animali couldnt belive it i shot it anyway to see what happens my bullet didnt do anything greatso then i found out that you have to buy the license for real moneythe rest of the time i tried to find another animal i had some sort of deer call noise can in my inventory but it didnt had any effect what so ever so at the end i just rage quit this game takes a lot of patience like an inhuman amount of patience this is not entertainment
at the beginning i didnt know how to dodge kept losing then just uninstalled the game about six months later one of my friends introduced me to the game again i was hooked very fun fast paced fighting game one of my favorite games by far keep up the good work blue mammoth games update now that the game has been out for some time now and i have one thousand hours on it it is still an amazing game and overall now that it is on the consoles it is even better when it comes to the future of brawlhalla
"alright so ive played a little bit of this game and what i find most about it is that its repetitive very repetetive will i keep playing probably but i cant give this game a good review as much as im sure all of you would like this to be a good review now when i say its repetitive i mean that the storyline is practically the same for all characters ill admit the gameplay is slightly different for some characters and the job changes offer a small bit of interest for all of five minutes but overall the gameplay becomes repetitive the quests are just meh and quite frankly the pay to have op stuff tactic is poor design tldr the gameplay is repetitive the quests are repetitive the characters dont feel different enough and dont get me started on the in game real money shop i appreciate that the devs put a lot of time into this but quite frankly i dont care for it this game rates at three thousand, two hundred and ten from me and even that i feel is too generous"
been playing hg for over a year stop playing twelve weeks ago got back into the game in the last 3weeks downloaded the update the game play has gone down hill real quick it use to be a fun game to playit had its problems here and there but good game to play but now its unplayable i couldnt recommend this rubbish to anyone sad to see a good game go down the drain
early access review4 hours in i am feeling pretty positive about the game and the way it looks and feels i ran it on a entry level laptopi5 8t gen1050ti 4gb8gb ddr4performance was beyond good im frowning at you pubg no lag encountered yet and no glitch except a door closing glitch where you get stuck if in between or youll be thrown back inside proswell optimisedsmall sizebrilliant enviroment designits freeconsyoull die in a snaprecoil is unforgivingplayer base is too small for enjoyment as of creation of this reviewhuge maps feels empty too empty at average ten minutes or so go without any encounter
this is a nope game for a nope somebody i tell you download at your own risk this is a horrible nightmare causing game it also breaks your three thousand dollar computer if your not carful enough from slaiming it in fear but if you want to impress your friends speed run this you wont no balls
slow to load takes a couple rounds of rocket league to load while not giving any indication of the progress and slow to run i wouldnt recommend this there are other games out there that albeit with lesser graphics provide a much better flying experience
early access reviewthe fps in this game is so awful that i cant go into any town areas as that makes it so bad that its as good as having your game freeze additionally when the game developers decided every class was doing too much damage they nerfed each class by eighty and no thats not an exaggeration naturally this made it near impossible to finish any story quests with more than one enemy not to mention any dungeons i might be able to put up with that but the fps is the worst which they wont even aknowledge despite hundreds of players screaming about it on twitter etc dont buy this game until after theyve fixed such issues after that it might be worth it
great game with many heroes to pick from and fight against its definitly worth your time but do remember that hirez studios the developers and publishers are absalout cancer and most of their games are bad smite however is the exception and is good fun with friends or alone
early access reviewgraphics are pretty although generic the game hitches a lot and you are forced into pvp zones to do the main questline you can use peace declarations to not get attacked but there is no grace period on the cooldowns between when the declaration expires and when you can click another from your inventory in short if youre being followed around by some twit farming rep whos twelve levels higher than you and fully decked out youre boned if you just want to click ground spawns to advance the story if youre into pvp just dilly i guess annoying if youre not
a postapocalyptic paradisefaloout shelter is one of my favorite free to play games of all time i can play this game anywhere thanks to its multiple platforms on the couch in bed while im eating and anywhere else i can think of it may not be like the other fallout rpg or shooter games where you get to roam the wasteland but instead you get to simulate overseeing your own vault of dwellersamd build the greatest vault the wasteland will ever seeand if you get bored after playing for thirty hours or unlocked everything in the vault with max number of dwellers and semi max special just destroy your vault and make another one thats what i did after playing for a week and ive been playing for one hundred and ten hours now
possibly one of the largest most expansive games ive ever palyed holy great googly tains this is simply massive full on battles full on wars and a simple yet diverse environment to explore with variation tot he point where it feels like a literal new planet each time youre in a fight and all for free hell yeah
early access reviewembodies literally everything wrong with the mmo genre these days if you are planning to buy this just to give it a try and see if it maybe captures the feeling of adventure mmos in the early 2000s had dont this is another soulless onrails grindfest to the level cap you one or twoshot all quest mobs and never get in danger of dying while questing so theres no point in asking other people to play with you youre gonna level faster on your own anyways of course that also makes all rare gear you get from dungeons and levelups feel meaningless too everythings already dying in two hits regardless what difference does it make oh and then theres the autorun to quest objective feature because nothing spells out adventure like literally going on rails then theres the super linear main quest that every mmo these days has to have because thats what people are asking for when they say they want leveling to be more fun cutscenes dear mmo developers please stop making questing just a chore to get to the real game at the level cap let there be some involvement let me at least have to turn my brain on let people die if they pull too many mobs if the game is harder people will want to play together and form bonds more
so here we are again out in the wilderness days gone by and your hard throbbing member has yet to be planted into some raw juicy rear you sit out in your scrawny little watch tower when suddenlybluarghthats it all youve been waiting for that one handsome and musculant call from the woods you take out your deer homo caller and let out one equally as homoerotic call hoping that itll react to it you patiently wait out those painstaking minutes which feel like hours you look through your binoculars and you see something something in the bush that isnt quite right its the antlers those big pointy and majestic antlers piercing through the foilage your nerves are going haywire your breathing is out of control but you manage to keep your binoculars steady as you focus on the beast it breaks through the foilage there is is muscular sweaty and musky stag just waiting to be plugged you stow your binoculars away as you approach the galiant beast every step you take towards it makes your heart beat faster and faster you can see it you can smell it you can feel it and there it is right in front of you just a stone toss away youre ready youve prepared your whole life for this your senses are going through the roof you reach into your pants unbuckle the strap whop out your throbbing and wellgreased gun you clear your mind slow down your breathing and take aim bangeverything quiets down there you are right on top of it you stroke your hand over the fur and gently carass the antlers after filling it up with your munition and just as youre about to pull out a mysterious man walks out of the woods and looks you straight in the eyesit has come to my attention that youve been dropping whitetail deer with unpermitted ammoto hell with you doc
i just cant stop playing this game great for pros but has a lot of use for casual players too with online play that is always different due to the huge variety of playable characters gods from various pantheons
the game itself can certainly be enjoyable at times but ninety of your time will be taken up by the long and boring grind for vehicles and their modules which most require to even function properly this is only made worse by a dev team that continues to completely ignore and then openly mock the playerbase whenever they raise legitimate concerns italian tanks were teased months ago and still we have nothing world war mode is probably never coming development on naval forces is at a minimum and air battles have seen no meaningful development in years on top of all this almost all new content is toptier tanks for the already crowded german soviet and american trees whilst the smaller british french and japanese trees get nothing the devs dont care about the players or the game they just want to squeeze as much money out of you as they can before the game dies edit thanks to the recent controversies gaijin have finally started to implement one or two positive changes so there is a dim light at the end of the tunnel
for someone who never played this title it is freakin amazing when you start to learn the ropes and get into some good fights im talking full air armour vehicle and infantry combat so semless that sometimes you will just stop and admire the crazy battle ragging in front of you to all new players do yourself a favor and watch a few vids on youtube to get some pointers to get going in the right direction promise you wont be disapointed
if you can remember one thing from me remember this you must never lose faith in yourself if you dont believe you can win then youll suffer defeat not only in duels but in real life believe me that advice is more valuable than any card youll ever own but i wouldnt know ive not collected the best cards in the game yet believe in the heart of the cards they wont mislead you you too will soon come to know fear when someone says cyber angel or red eyes1010 gotyoriginally posted by eien the only cheating ive witnessed was someone who was using three cyber angel ritual cards in ranked who i blocked and reported for cheating to konami doesnt that limit take effect jan eight two thousand and eighteen thats what i read in the reportyay you reported and blocked an inncent person because you couldnt readhttps imgur coma7a14ldate of forbiddenlimited list implemetation is january eight two thousand and eighteen
i love this game the story is intruiging and graphics are awesome even on a poor machine module three is about to come out an d more classes are scheduled to come as well highly recommend for anyone who likes mmos and forgotten realms

early access reviewi was about to give this a negative review because i thought it had no servers thankfully i didnt write that review and decided to give this game another go i got addicated to this game after my second chance got to rank seven in a day and the servers were not at all empty it just takes a while for it to find the servers near you now as for the actual gameplay ill list cons and pros pros the visual graphics are great for a free to play game not a pay to win game you can purchase custom skinspaint jobs for your ship and two premium ships is what you can buy the two premium ships arent that overpowering to put that into perspective of how weak they are my free ship that i earned with credits can kill both of them in a 2v1 against me the sound effects are pretty real if ships were a thing in space id say the sounds would be pretty close you can upgrade your current ship cons only one gamemode to be fair it has another gamemode but no one is able to select it so i think they may be working on that other gamemode no customizablity with the ships other than the skins you have to buy with real money you can put your own decals on it or to create your own camoskin of the ship to make it truley yours i dont want a samelooking ship as other players do i want to make it truley mine finding my location and finding nearby servers take too long it needs to be fixed
out of point 80personel note very easy game when u understand and game can play itself when you choice to right crusaders and builds
"trying to explore the map will result in forced returns back to your base camp devs tried to compensate for this small area of exploration with poor moving mechanics moving around is slow and annoying because the character is out of shape and breathes heavily every second of moving at a walking speed there are only two speeds slow and slower shooting mechanics are just ok final verdict three thousand, six hundred and ten"
early access reviewthis game makes me feel like im playing the original game all over again with a new twist hell the main hub town it brings you to after the tutorial is a 3d replica of the first battleon it even has the same character placement if you played on battleon so long ago like i did this game is a great blast of nostolgia that made me smile i highly recommend it for anyone who played the original from the standpoint of someone who never played the original games you may find this as a miss but give it a chance before you judge it maybe even go onto the battleon sight and try the original
bad awesome game s not like i wasted sixteen hundreds hours of my goddamn useless life in it as well as money i regret nothing edit now its twentyeight fortythrees hours edit two now even after loosing my will to play the game because of a scam i still hold this game very very dearly i cannot hate a game ive spent three thousand and forty hours on i just cant i still regret nothing lmao
early access reviewquite cool how they made it 3d i just hope to god that they wont limit ninety of the items unless you pay for a membership gameplay needs a lot more work if they wanna compete with other f2p mmos on the market cause its very stiff
early access reviewpros devs listen to feedback and implement them quickly true crossplatform pc and mobile players get to play on the same map even a potato can run the game monetization is very fair its pay2notwait similar to warframe updates are frequent cons the game only has around three thousand and fifty hrs of content atm many qol features are still missing and can make the game frustrating at times quests dont give you enough exp to move between some zones so you are forced to grind not much options for graphics settings aside from one detail slider and a checkbox for bloom and dof
product received for freeearly access reviewfreejam you seriously have ed up the original robocraft to the hardest of hardcore ive been through most of these updates since i first saw the yogscast feature it when it was a new game that was the ing game i remember i loved ive been pretty forgiving but every update by far has made the game worse and worse you guys are just as bad as fb was when they kept changing it after we all got used to it the first time i actually said this update is ing awesome was when i found out about no more armor tiers and it could all be painted and we still had the megabots you ed me over when you updated the tier system where you couldnt mix low teir with high tier and caused me to delete all five of my bots you then updated again and made it so all tiers work no matter how you mixed them so you made me delete my ing creations just so in two months you could say haha you they work again and then i spend my goddamn money multiple times just to help make my creations my battles easier for me and for what just so you can flush it all down the drain on me and every other ing player i dont know what the hell you guys are thinking but this game is not the same game it was many years ago untill you ers decide what the robocraft is really going to be im done trying to build and battle when you guys keep changing it to where i cant use anything and have to change everything every ing time you update
game is sexist your character is female and there are no options yet on being a male1010 would still play to hear the screaming cries of the enemies i destroy with my amazing fast fingering technique of my mouse clicking
early access reviewhello all this is my opinion of the game take what i say into consideration before purchasing this game week one major issues was happening not anything new to a new mmo launch fixed pretty quick to say the least apart from other mmos i have played week two was ok i believe pvp started up got to experience it and wasnt bad but some classes were op and considering this game is focused on pvp it didnt meet alot of players expectations but pvp is hard to balance but pvp was the only end game there week thirty four devs kicked half if not all emissarys some deserved to be kicked and some didnt emissarys are post to give feedback positive or negative if the dev team cant communicate to emissarys then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it was executed right gameplay i thought the gameplay was smooth although huge fps problems for alot of people including me i felt optimization could of been better for a early access game that was mostly done just a few minor fixes here and there but that was not the case combat was ok kinda felt clunky even switching stances felt clunky to me combat was a slowfast pace mix when using skills but overall pretty fun taming brillant idea that i hate to see go to waste loved this aspect of the game you could capture anything just about in the game hope to see other mmos use this idea but make it even better although idk how you could make it even better haha crafting it was simple i liked that not really into lifeskills that much dungeons were pretty difficult after a few patches but the loot was meh even for the last dungeon this game failed because of poor communication from devs youtubers who only play to lvl twenty and so forth but i can not recommend this game in its current state i hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it took to big of a hit
810best free to play card game ive ever played and ive played many its very fast paced and easy to learn plus you can make endless interesting decks if youre a fan of the elder scrolls series then youll love all the references plus you dont have to invest any money into the game and still have just as much fun as a pay to play player however unfortunately top decks use the same strategies and cards which is a huge no no for a card game especially one introducing itself to the community pros fast pacedfree to play players can do just as good as pay to playgood early on playability cons game is unbalanced at timestop meta decks usually use the same cards and strategy
early access reviewhonestly its a fantastic game its incredibly vast and much more lifelike then its obvious cousin i have only been playing for a week so maybe my opinion will change as time goes on but i highly doubt it i am a little overwhelmed with all of the recipes and possiblities the game seems to offer but overall i am absouletly hooked the game is fun i havent run into a need to buy pro to actually play and enjoy the game although many of the reviews ive read seem to state otherwise guess we will see
mobile game that got ported to pc the worst thing is that youll get automatic loss if you fight against a mobile user update feb01 achievements are broken and it seems like the devs wont fix them anytime soon most people fixed the issue using the data transfer feature but that requires starting the game on mobile first
this game is basically hearthstone with a skyrim setting but they added lanes into the card arena just to make it very rngesque and to attempt to differentiate it from hearthstone as with all f2p card games you get what you pay for unless you grind for hundreds or thousands of hours the game simply isnt fun enough for me to bother doing that if you want a simple free game but arent bothered about winning get this one if youre super serious about being top ranked get out your wallet
early access review6 ten concept gameplay design are wins but end result is a fail for me in general its a good game easy to learn and play the diversity is pretty extensive good selection of elements as basis with added neutral cards allows a good selection for decks and then the possibility to multiclass between elements brings in the real complexity of such games most of all is the simplicity with some beautifull deco and cards effect unfortunately this said theres the cons side lets start with details description of effect and such you cant put much on cards so i do like the overlay for detailed info but there a lack of precision in those said details all you can read is always the same generic message they need to look into others games to really understand this part for last what reaally sinks them is the sigils concept they control the level and power of the cards but also link to turns unfortunately the fact that its not garanty that youll find since you need to draw them as you would other cards soo you have fifty cards in your deck then you add twentyfive sigils makes it seventyfive cards one third of those cards are sigils the outcome is the side i hate from this game you can either get minmax amount of sigils if you get a min amount its game over since you cant afford higher cards in opposite if you get too many on a constant basis your level does go up but you have nothing to play or defend with this leaves you with the fair amount throughout the game which is either win or loses but after how many failed turn due to unbalance sigils distribution
okay all jokes aside this is super ing cool if you want to learn how to smuggle a gun through security but cant figure out how just watch this game show you how to break that thing down to a thousand tiny lego pieces then learn how to put it back together in the dark blindfolded by playing the click everything till it works reassembly of said gun super well done super cool very very useful if you want to learn to disassemble your own gun without breaking it first with or without gun ownership a great game to own an interesting game to play p s to the guy who wrote not the best game to play in airports i have pulled this game up like two dozen times in the past year since i read that i have always thought of that post as i did so funny as to this day well played
this game started to update itself and the update came with a trojan called win32kryptik agjl which was detected by my antivirus software i trust steam but this incident makes me question if this trust is maybe misplaced needless to say neverwinter was uninstalled and will not be installed again

i knew this was just a conversion from the mobile application therefore my expectations for this game should have been low it is impossible however not to feel some excitement when engaging with new material from the fallout universe and excitement walks handinhand with high expectations fortunately fallout shelter has to a great extent met those expectations why this game is so simple to play which makes it perilously addictive everything can be controlled with just the mouse for instance to assign vault dwellers to specific roles you just drag and drop them to specialised rooms that s right the pun was intended your vault dwellers have the s p e c i a l system just like fallout and some of the rooms have a preferred s p e c i a l s the science lab required high intelligence for example while it isn t compulsory to adhere to the assigned s p e c i a l doingso will make you vault dweller very happy and happiness as you will find is very important the rooms of your vault weapons and armour will be limited in the beginning but your options quickly grow with the growth of your vault s population which can be increased in two ways you can build a radio studio to attract dwellers from the wasteland or in a more novel way assign a male and female dweller to a living quarters then sitback and let the amorous spectacle commence fortunately for those sickminded individuals out there the game won t let you force incest or exile a pregnant dweller as for the graphics they are of course basic but not repulsive or retrofeeling in fact the endearing vault boy cartoonstyle pervades the game and makes each dweller quite endearing the power armour suits though look a little compressed and a little too comical the replay value of the game is somewhat limited which of course is because fallout shelter was intended to be the launchpad for fallout four this is evident in the missions which after incorporating some witty dialogue in keeping with the fallout universe fail to vary and challenge the player the management in combat is limited the same halfadozen locations become dreary and the enemies equally so in short the missions can become something to run in the background in order to gain revenue whilst being more attentive to another task in your internet browser overall this game is definitely worth playing but only if you looking for a bit of lighthearted fun the serious gaming and longterm gaming remains with fallout four or for more avid fallout fans like myself fallout new vegas
early access reviewdont if you dont want to wasit your time play the original it has thirteen years of work the company artix clearly doesnt know how to run this game too good with its cross platform this game is limited so dont expect too much from it again if you want to play this game and dont like it go to the original and then see
this game really needs maintenaince in so many ways laggylow res literally minecraft tanksconnection via wireless last player to load ingameits better to play on phone not com why the hell did i download dis theres world of tanks computerkys blitz
tbh this game has alot of potential it is a pretty good game different enough from minecraft the graphics are very good the soundtrack is amazing the night sky is just oh so magical the corruption layer is hard as it should be and its very scary as it should be the enemies are pretty nice and fun and definetly more dificult than any enemies in minecraft now lets look at the bad things the recepy things can get pretty annoying because you need to craft something that can be pretty expensive to get something you really need which can be pretty annoying but nothing horrible there is no goal at all yes there is some hidden story in this but thats really not what you could call a goal i mean you can set yourself a goal but i mean thats pretty i dont want to be rude but thats kinda lame other than that this game has alot of potential and i hope the next update will bring many more things not like the steampunk update that didnt bring almost anything except for people who are able to purchase things for money
so let me break it down world of guns gun disassembly is a unique game if ive ever seen one you start off with a classic kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt not much of a spoiler there but yeah the game is all about unlocking things field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly assemble to operation operation to game game to super game and super game to hardcore game you can geuss what the first three are operation is using the various features on a gun changing handgrips firing it attaching a silencer or even folding a stock the games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint on super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints you might be thinking okay thats easy well ive spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first a few times the game screws you over by saying you need to do this first even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you example you need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on one gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod but this particular gun needs both to be on its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it on the graphics end of it the outside of the gun looks awesome one thousand and ten texturing on the inside though many parts have brush texturing this means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black honestly theyre just shaped blocks at that point a mere representative no complaint unless your obbscessed with hd textures on the of the guns themselfves tons of variety i find quite a few guns i like in their collection however i need to sift through alot of guns i dont cary about at all just to get to them sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock but whats the fun of that well ill tell you total access unless you got alot of time and patience you wont get through this game without paying because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one sure the points increase as you move on up but the points needed per gun almost quadruple so it makes playing fairly hard to do also you cannot earn any points through the ranges i do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot plus its just challenges and not free shooting you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish the graphics for the range also take a plunk going to cs sixteen esque graphics aka crappy world textures and okay gun textures there is also another few ways to unlock points two of them broken for me reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me first is coming back every day dont laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row even if you only pop in the grab that bonus but make sure you come back every day or itll reset next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds i managed to join the group but now it wont let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function i have even used the other method in game and it still doesnt work but this gives you some credits and a ton of xp to use on unlocking guns but i cant use it because its broken last method is the quiz which has a high failure rate for me figuresquizes test your ability to recognize the gun models the more you get right is the more xp you get to walk away with get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for two hours the funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points it will however even though i got all the questions right lock me out for two hours its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz but yet i get none of my earned points it only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz if not it basically locks the game up because it doesnt give me the button craziest thing is if i fail the quiz it doesnt crash at all i feel like theyre trying to keep me from getting points cheeki bastards anyways im reinstalling still voting positive for this game even though its got a bunch of cheeki breeki coders
early access reviewdo i recommend this game hell yes i have spent a good deal of the past few months on this game and i can tell you that by achieving one thousands hours of gameplay very recently that this game is not the kind of indie youd expect the devs are always checking up on forums responding to concerns and helping in every way they possibly can to a severalthousand person playerbase with fifteen devs running the place theyve gone to exceedingly long lengths to make this game balanced and if any player out there gets into this game early know this all that fun youre having in the low tiers yeah it only gets better from there d i honestly am extremely proud to say that my favorite game of all time has won indie of the year and i cannot say it enough thank you to all the people that make this game fun rc is love rc is life
early access reviewamazing game i have never ran into a game like this tf2 i really love the way everything stands out and has its own fun style in the world its like minecraft but ninety nine better people could disagree but i wont im just saying if you try this game you will have fun and dont get stressed out if you cnt do or find something because the world is huge thank you for making this game it is an awesome game that i think will get into the famous route
early access reviewim currently on room one hundred and fifty and i feel like i can now give this game a recommendation this is a very basic premise that could almost be satire since it starts off with cardboard cutouts but the art design is great its quite sp00ky it doesnt cost you anything and it only took me four minutes to download so i cant complain
this game applies to a very niche market and if you arent prepared to pay you probably wont enjoy it that being saidi think its a great game and its highly rewarding when you get kills the community is very active and you can play competitions daily as long as you are prepared to pay youll probably enjoy it
this game is not worth the headache i got muted for saying that i was eating nacho chips and that is not the only time neverwinter muted me every week for nothing it feels liek some kids is just clicking report on everyone and neverwinter must use a computer that just mutes you when ever you get any report on yourself i was a payign customer of neverwinter i put my own hard earned money into the game and i got banned for reasons that are completly unreasonable the game is so repetative after level seventy that well it leaves you wonderign why why do i even play this game neverwinter does not work on game bugs and the graphics are way outdated no wonder its a ftp ptw type of game it leaves you so bored after a week cause thats hwo long ti takes to get max level
"dont get me wrong this game has a lot of good points but has one major flawi will start with the big flawthis game is is free to play and doesnt have a vip level caps or premium areas its ridiculously expensive if you want to make any real progress ill give a few examples there are free mounts in the game which can be bought with in game goldthese are very plain and basic mounts the best mounts in the game cost twentyfive hundreds three thousand, five hundred zen this translates to twenty five twenty five for a horse skin and faster movement speed which i can buy a whole game foryou can earn astral diamonds can be converted zen six times a day so there is a way to earn the items well say you might make twenty thousand astral diamonds in a day which i personally wasnt anywhere near doing but one zen three hundred and eighty ad so to buy that horse 3500zen youre going to need one million, three hundred and thirty thousand astral diamonds which is sixtysix days of play which is stupiddownloadable content is ridiculously expensive considering its just items gear and mountshigh level items all require astral diamonds or zenthe ingame money is pretty much useless and can only buy health potions and kitsto unlock the treasure chest at the end of that dungeon you just did not regular quests requries you to buy a key with astral diamondsgame is too simple you get three abillities two passives two big abillities and a class specific sort of mode these can eb swapped out with other skills that you unlock but heck give me some varietygame was never really that challenging im sure it gets more difficult but i got to level fortythree with very little difficultygame looks alright for a mmorpg very few look amazinggame is very poorly optimized im running a titan x 32gb of ram six core with hyper threading and all over clocked on a 4k screen witcher three which is an absolutely stunning game graphically and rubs this game in the dirt always had forty fpsin some areas this game makes me hit twenty fps which is abysmalquests are quite repetitivei guess ill get to some positives then nowareas and mobs are diverseboss fights are pretty coolgood to just pass some time if youve got nothing to playgame has a lot to do by the looks of it and if youve got hundred of pounds to waste then heck go aheadvery clear dungeons and dragons elementsthough you cant use the majority of your abillities theres quite a lot to choose fromif the developers want to improve this game make your zen exchanges rates better with real world currencymake the regular currency able to buy more things literally everything should be pourchasable with coppers even if you have to balance it by making it quite a lottoo many sub currencies in the games e g seals astral diamonds zen coppers things like loot shouldnt come at a cost to just open"
"brawlhalla is the greatest game ever made its that simple using items in competitive play may seem like this game is for filthy casuals but actually this game is for intelectuals like myself that enjoy masterfully crafted games rivals more like brawlhalla that game iz two herd so ima play dis gem now k thx one thousand, one hundred and ten"
the best way to describe this game is by using a quote from beavis and butthead beavis its called money um heh its called mmheh moneymoney and chicks yeahbutthead uhhuhhuh that would be coolbeavis yeah yeah its like first the teacher gives us like some money and then we get to go score with all these chicks yeah mmmheh its pretty cool you should sign upbutthead uhh beavisbeavis and then after we score with the chicks we get more money and then like and then like more chicks cause we have more money and then we get more more moreand then butthead slaps him1010 money and chicks for twenty fifteens game of the year
is scary wouldnt want to get too attached to this smashlike game i do think its quite different to smash especially in balance because this game has cause so many frustrations time to talk about the community noobspammers skilled spammers regular spammers cocky eleven yearolds talking eight yearolds people that will ruin others games because their game was ruined the community is so toxic and that it makes everyone else toxic if you were to play this game play it on ps4 the best console the community is still quite new there so people havent really found out how to ruin your day everyone in goldplat who think theyre good im the trashman
i used to enjoy playing this game back in the earlier beta stages since then i have grown to dislike the game fractured space went from a free to play game to a pay to win game players used to have a level playing field in terms of ships but now a player can buy implants to make their crew overpowered implants can be earned through months or years of grinding for supply drops or by buying currency and getting the ones one needs it is truly disapointing to see this game turn to the dark side of free to play games because i really liked playing this game i would pay sixty to buy this game but i will not feed a pay to win scandel in addition to the above problem getting credits in game is incredibly grindy a player may get fifteen thousand credits from a match but it takes upwards form three hundred thousand to buy a ship combine that with the five minute que time and the player is looking at a wasted day i personally have had one last issue with this game i do not know if this happend to any other players but i had all my ships reset a long time ago shortly after they added the black widow i believe i had owned all of the ships currently in the game and then i had to grind all the credits to buy new ones it was dissapointing to say the least
really tried to like it but has technical issues at least on my pc amdwin10is not a mmo is an online multiplayer tankairplane capture the flag war game you have a limited number of respawns in the same match some maps has airtanks units i didnt found a proper way to organize battles for people who does not have teamspeak is a free for all it runs smooth when it does not freeze nice models and sounds for a free game is ok
early access reviewthis game has a lot of potential what started as an april fools joke expanded to a amazing battle royale game but the hollows from the halloween update just remove them
a great game for people that like to shoot zombies it really gives you the walking dead dayz hype feelingalso great fro fps rookies and the teamplay is really intense and it gives you the creeps at night while runnig through a forrest with zombies behind you overall score my opinion a seven hundred and ten keep up the good work folks
i think the game is great but its a little annoying that you have to be a member to enjoy the game if youre not a member your play options is limited it would be great if they made some more options for free users i would recommend the game if there were more options but right now i dont
early access reviewi very much enjoy playing this game its fun competitive and intense yet still in alpha i personally believe that this could be a great game i love how it takes some components from paladins champions of the realm and able to transform it into something new i recommended playing paladins first because you will gain an advantage over other players however there are a large amount of bugs needed to be fixed
its pay to win the grinding for free players is absolutely awful theres multiple free tanks that are severely underpowered unti lyou upgrade them thing that will take hundreds of games of grinding theres paid tanks that not only are a lot better than free tanks but also stand out from the rest in a negative way with ridiculous models and decorations
early access reviewhealthy item mall with only cosmetics locked behind paid currency f2p shooter with typical f2p shooter content bad players that look like they play with no sound good players with aimbotlike precision jumpers and crouchers pingers yo go to your servers we dont need 200ms here etc etc sidenote add more maps to demo pool ty1110would learn spanishslang again
early access reviewmy initial thought of the game for the first fifty rooms was that the game was not very scary at all that all changed as soon as i opened the next door because i met the first monster who scared the out of me nine hundred and ten
grind grind grind its just about grinding you have to play a lot to get powerful other than that everything is on sale you dont have a knife or secondary gun your gun doesnt have sight you have to pay seventy five thousand for 2times scope sight if you wanna know how much is this the us m3 submachingun price is fifty thousand still cheaper than the scope i got bored that everything needs buying even your ammunation
eh pretty good nothing original all ing liars this game admitidly is not for casuals there is the door now onto the review this game is pretty much the best fps ever as long as there will be people to play it combining mmo and fps with satisfying stratgey elements the compromise with free to play is there is pay to play options but you are never required to drop even a penny join a squad rek some noobs and boom enough cash to buy a decent sniper all in all the most important thing to remmeber is this game ages like a fine wine to any experienced gamer especially when you get gud with the vehicles
great franchise ruined by f2p crp five for a track really simbin rr race seven graphics is better but that wasnt hard to achieve after five years race seven rr everything else i wont write why f2p model sucks no there are other things which completely ruin experience too menu design is super ugly terrible broken and confusing big wheel design is super idiotic console thing what this s it is doing in pure pc game is beyond reason its one of the worst menu designs i ever saw and my eyes are hurt every time i have to navigate in menu because of terrible font rendering and then game doesnt see my gamepad really it works perfectly fine in race seven contoller setup is poorer from seven too i cant drive properly because of lack of many options from 07game has always online drm not recommendedupdatei tried it first time after february because of sale gamepad now works still super ugly and confusing menus autoshifting is broken it goes up auto but you have to manually shift down still only time trials update ii fifth july twenty fourteens sound is the best among racing simulations its just oustanding they introduced competitions which is great way to experience content you dont own and if you are excellent driver you can win various things kudos for that i installed game again because there is fifty summer sale and simbin sent month ago some free vrps i got eight hundred mostly for people who dont play it anymore now some bad things you need to drive perfectly in time trials you read it right even if you slightly hit off road and i mean you didnt cut curve your lap time is invalid ha ha ha no solution drive as amateur in leaderboard challenge then its like old race 07and then there is a bug reported by others which put my pc into hibernation and then just restart it wtf
do not buy there is no controler support even thos they claim there is cant remap any keys to do anything i can turn left and thats it i can sit there turning left cant move nothing took four days to even beable to load the game
neowiz should have annouce this game as f2p from the beginning to avoid confusion they have given people the false impression that this game is only buy to play i am sure if they stated this earlier people would not be as angry not to mentioned the other problems which people have been talked about i do enjoy the gameplay even with all the problems but one only problem is i feel being cheated by neo as they turn the game into f2p which i would have not pre purcahse if they well inform us that this game is going to be f2p oh well i quitted this game best of lucks and lastly i do really feel bad the people who are on the same boat as me take care guys
this is a game that requires you to smite stuff in the face over and over lots of smiting in smite smite this face and you smite that face you smite here and you smite there its smite
i began the game and i started to wander around because i had no idea what to do but after ten minutes of the slowest walking ever then i found some tracks i started following them and after twenty minutes i found a mound of deer poop and the kept following the tracks then i stumbled upon a pheasent the first live creature i had seen in the game i aimed in my rifle after scouring the controls on how to equip my gun and pulled the trigger nothing came out a notification that i dont have the correct license to hunt that type of animal and that if i wanted to become a member to check the store so i walked around for another twenty minutes i ended up making a circle of the whole map and ended up at the lodge where i began then i quit the game that explains the time i have in it after looking at the store i came to notice that this game is pay to win and then i uninstalled it i wouldnt recomend this game unless it was bill gates because he could afford to buy all of the crap that in any other game you would purchase with ingame money
while this game is an inovative first person experience with great graphical effects realistic characters and one of the best plots ive seen in games so far i do have some points of critic one the storytelling is pretty linear and sometimes makes you feel like your ingame choices dont matter two the bosses are way to hard to beat while fapping
lovely game its an amazing game technically outstanding showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail especially in the allimportant multiplayer aspects the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying it took me a long time to warm up to but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends if you can spare the time play it
early access reviewwith the last patch the royale game become a casual game all the best weapons are spawned randomly so you can be a best player but two hundred hits demage vs eight hundred hits you cant do nothing
well gaijin net agent removed warthunder due to unwantedunasked and unneeded software being installed without my permission and the ability to remove it being obfuscated it looks like one these malspyware sending data even when updates not needed this stay on your pc even when game uninstalled i will suggest everybody to remove it what is quite problematic
this review is for those who are already familiar with mobas and have played dota two or league of legends i will point out what makes smite unique compared to those games third person camera perspective unlike the classics smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character this allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesnt necessarily require a cloaking ability almost every ability in the game has to be aimed including melee and ranged basic attacks thats right if you want to play the ad carry in smite prepare yourself to be completely useless if you cant land your basic attacks same goes for everything else if you cant hit your abilities reliably you will not succeed there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed from the other perspective this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations many times i was one hit away from death but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements i survived playable characters heroes champions in smite are real gods from pantheons that were once and some still are worshipped norse roman mayan hindu chinese greek play as zeus thor odin loki and many other gods and mythical creatures hirez studios does a mostly great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable characters and for those deities you dont know there is always a lore section for every god so you even learn something about different cultures while you play yay knowledge five different game modes one that changes every day unlike its competitors smite features many different game modes aside from the classical 5vs5 here called conquest arena 5vs5 no lanes team deathmatch siege 4vs4 two lanes small jungle joust 3vs3 one lane small jungle assault 5vs5 all random all mid one lane the mode of the day changes every day and features fun setups like 5vs5 on the assault map and everyone gets the same god all of these game modes have their own detailed and well crafted map in conquest mount olympus opposes a vulcano in arena you fight in a grand colloseum in assault you defend the halls of asgard from the forces of chaos in siege you fight for supremecy in the lush mayan rainforests and in joust youre a knight for some reason it will be changed to a chinese themed map soon in addition to that smite features one of the best deals in a free to play game the god pack the god pack costs thirty and contains every god currently in the game owners of the god pack also receive the newest god as soon as theyre released forever that means the more gods join the battle of smite the more value you get for your thirty you do the math why should you play smite over league or dota if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobas but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones smite will be the game for you its highly skillbased with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional mobas do not have i played league of legends for four years but after i got athritis this is a joke from playing adc and kiting for too long i gave up for me smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional mobas never did i will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about smite i am not delusional many skins in smite are locked behind chests which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god is announced only to later find out its in a chest with fiftysix other items hirez abuses this a bit too much though we have the god pack so that balances it out eu servers can be very unreliable quality control at hirez is either nonexistent or very bad some new gods release in a pitiful state either balance or designwise they have horrid animations amateurlike voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered some god designs are also very questionable sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their lore or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense did you know the spartans put the statues of ares the god of war in chains to restrain him yeah thats cool but only a small footnote in his lore well what hirez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact he shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield the shield has a demonic visage on it where the fire comes out does that sound like the greek god of war to you not to me but these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience ive been playing this game for more than a year and only looking forward its free in the end so why not try it out and look for yourself
if you can get passed the microtransactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately then there is tons of content and gameplay time you can get out of this it is not pay to play every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and its really fun once you start to get the hang of the game proscan be played in a massive group or solo several to farm for per class large community for help a steady learning curve you will get better a pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths you shouldnt have many unfair deaths that make you ragequit consspam botshave to pay to unlock more character slotshasnt been many major updates for a very long time this game just isnt for everyone but its free and definitely worth trying out im not that into games with third person view but i have hundreds of hours of this game on the rotmg website
ive tried this game a few times but its always been awkward and clunky as if weird mechanics have been kept to make it feel nostalgic and how it used to be and if you dont have a large screen the hud just feels way too large combined with a mediocre community and a lot of anger and complexity its only really good for hardcore moba fans newcomers should play literally any other moba
early access review cool looking game ill try it oh ok im restricted to one class until i get enough xp or i could pay to become a sniper spent many hours grinding my xp so i could become a sniper finally became sniper oh what i have to buy that sniper rifle thats dumb i better start grinding or i could just pay real money finally earned enough to purchase sniper rifle wtf i need to grind for money to buy ammo for the sniper rifle or i could paying for it with real money this game is a huge money sink nobody wins not even those who pay to win even people who want to play as a tank driver or pilot have to keep paying for new tanks and planes
early access reviewcurrently the game has a lot of large glaring issues with it i am not talking about server stability or queue times as that is the norm for an mmo launch there are a lot of issues in the game still in the basic areas like optomization combat feeling disjointed and overall feeling of clunkiness with the game as a whole i understand they added the combo combat system to the game to appeal more to the market but currently it feels very wrong action combat was a feature when advertised to the naeu market and currently only one class has the action combat crosshairs in game and admittedly the devs removed it from all the other classes i think this game has a lot of potential and it being an older game with some reworks makes it even more it seems like they truely wanted to revise and reinvigorate the game however currently it just falls flat i hope the devs can do something to make this game really shine but there is a lot of negative information about them circulating around right now so its a grey area i cannot reccommend this game simply because promised features that were shown and used previously are completely absent without any notification from the dev team i have hope albeit very little that they can make this into something great
nice specimen of incremental games with lots of builds to try and not paytowin at all however it definitely need more steam achievements in my opinion most trophies except easiest ones should have steam achievement linked to it
i may not have a whole lot of experience with this game but from what i played it just feels like a clunkier version of hearthstone if youre looking for a game like hearthstone with a unique twist try pvz heroes out instead of this
early access reviewthis was my new favorite game to play on steam heavy emphasis on was idk why the devs had to go and screw this game up by putting women in it until it goes back to how it was uninstalling
fallout shelter is a free to play simulation game styled in the fallout series world the game tasks the player with building and managing their own vault fallout shelter and dealing with collecting resources as well as invading enemies you take the role of overseer the leader and coordinator of the vault your job is to make the inhabitants happy through meeting their needs power food water as well as tasking them to work in the correct areas dwellers inhabitants produce resources for their respective jobs at a different rate dependent on their special strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility luck most of the game revolves around this concept of balancing resources pros fun gameplay until you hit a certain point free to play visual style is enticing and fun to look at items and npcs from the fallout series are in the gamecons lack of depth ends up being very repetitive unneccessary amount of microtransactions lack of end game contenttldr simulator based in the fallout seriess world gameplay gets repetitive and lacks any end game content or a goal fun for a while but loses interest fairly quickly ps on a side note the games files are stored client side meaning you can edit your saves and adjust the times on your computer to affect your vault
early access reviewplayed for a bit game was so i uninstalled couple of hours later the ing warthunder launcher appears on my screen and starts downloading warthunder turns out it also installed a completely different process that you have to delete manually nice
"early access reviewan overused concept with some welcome additions to that base formula that allow for an intriguing if not all too familiar experience the actual game itself is littered with bugs which is to be expected with the nature of alpha builds all in all the experience is enjoyable but still nothing special although the recently increased and already very rapid and active development that is based off of the feedback from the community is a welcome change of pace from a competitive shooter that is not seen elsewhere and leads to hope for the future of this game as a whole overall i would give the game a six thousand, five hundred and ten in its current state"
early access reviewa fun alternative to pubgfortniteh1z1pros free character customization with sliders decent graphics runs smoothly expressly when compared to pubg decent gunplay expressly when compared to pubg better equipment management the game automatically equips modifications has easy scope switching and is relatively quick to gear up in travel perks gliding skiing climbing nice car physics ability to spotmark cons map in indonesianthai version was superior too large of a map means more spread out battles still faster paced than pubg a bit awkward but not as clunky as pubg or h1z1 cant jump when snowboarding the competitiveness of the game is watered down by the fact a helicopter allows up to four players to win so there is no last man standing showdown710 when compared to available battle royale games this one would probably be my top pick until blackout releases
early access reviewstarted out rough but theyre churning out patches really frequently and it seems like they genuinely care about the communitys feedback i wouldnt recommend it now unless you want to be there during the optimization process but six months down the line thisll be a great mmo if they keep the ball rolling
early access reviewedit so the game gets launched finally no more its still in beta forgive them they are experimenting antiwhines when i started the grind wasnt terrible when i started the gameplay wasnt terrible when i started the ping was terrible but i had no problem with that now the grind is unberable squad twenty forces you into a prefixed squad and cant change classes unless you made a personalized one and are playing on it which its more grind ah and if by any chance you play in latinoamerica have my steam in english though thenby reto all latinoamerica speaks brazilian old review until reto destroys and push out of the window the infamous squad twenty system
lots of potential but a real disappointment the rts side of the game was its point of difference over similar games like day of defeat or red orchestrarising sun however the developers have neglected this side of their game and focused on game mechanics that milk players of every last drop of cash milk i have around eight hundred hours played you used to be able to run the game in a browser without using steam and have come back to the game several times the game used to have flaws but was fun the biggest changes i noticed when i came back to look at the game most recently was that the grind has become huge and that the matches i played were not fun prices for all equipment items require hours of grinding this grinding is not fun i doubt i will be coming back to play again even though i have most of the top end equipment over thirty soldiers spread over three factions and a full array of generals and ats assault teams on them it is just not fun to play any more
early access reviewi dont write reviews at all but for bless online i wanted to take the time and do that i bought the game and i was hyped about it i understand that in early access things can go south but for this one things really way south i no longer have a desire to play this game for numerous of reasons that were mentioned in previous reviews the game is great but the management is very poor not to mention that most of the players quit playing this game
i differ from most reviewers that ive read my gripes arent against the cynical pay2win design or anything like that i utterly loathe the art and the game mechanics people say this game looks pretty i i am truly flabbergasted by that as i think it is the ugliest most generic looking piece of garbage and the game mechanics are superficial and in no way interesting id stay away from this game a long long way away
this is one of the best games ever made and when played on hardcore it is one of the most difficult challenging and rewarding games of the modern era a triumph over most games of this generation and a callback to times when every player had to learn the game they were playing in order to succeed rather than being catered to and handheld except this time you have an interactive community to help you along the way as the game features trading partying player housing and an interesting global chat and what a journey it will be the atmosphere of this game feels like a blend of dark souls meets diablo despite the graphics being pretty simple theres a ton of heart and fantastic art directionflavour paving every step of the way theres literally thousands upon thousands of ways to build your character despite this ninety of the community just plays coc builds hyperbolethe best part the game is free aside from some purely aesthetic microtransactions which look very nice no pay2win here until you need more stash tabs i e storage space the community is one of the most diverse for better for worse communities ive ever encountered and the depth of this game is greater than most mmorpgs despite this genre being an online arpg the difficulty scales to an absurd extent you can never truly faceroll every aspect of this gameunless you play coc in which case please uninstallyoure not a good player stop uploading twinned boss map clear videos to reddit nobody caresexcept for other coc players and theres just so much depth and replayable value to this game that i really cant recommend it enough the endgame on hardcore is insanely fun and often times heartracing with immense risk and reward being omnipresent throughout the experience the more you play this game the more you want to play it and that is a surefire sign of both an addictive problem and a masterpiece on the negative side of things the early portion of this game is a total unintuitive messif youre unfamiliar with the arpg genre or even if youre somewhat familiar with it the game will likely feel far too overwhelming to bother with it doesnt even bother trying to tutorialize you and while the exploratory independence the game gives you is ultimately empowering its a little too vacuous for genuinely new players several of the games mechanics character features are amazingly in depth and customizable once you begin to grasp them but unfortunately they also come off as very hard to understand initially and even once you begin to understand them youll likely fail to fully realize what you can do with them for quite some time none of this is necessarily bad but it could certainly be offputting to a large demographic the pace of the game is also painfully slow early on this is especially true if you have no gear and if youre new to the gamemost new players and even several veteran players dont know how to level efficiently and waste a lot of excess time doing certain pointless side quests picking up every useless item killing every mob doing irrelevant side areas etc bluntly put combat will not feel satisfying for a while but when your build starts to come together and the enemies start to possess actually significant mechanics boy oh boy does the world ever turn upside down on top of that the true game doesnt kick off until merciless difficulty by which point youll already have beaten the campaign twice and this is presently very unintuitive to newer players so a significant portion of the playerbase ends up beating the game in their eyes on normal and then never returning even though the real experience hasnt even begun yet although regardless at least these people get to experience the boss fight malachai which is something youll probably not soon forget however id still implore anyone who might turn away from the game because of these reasons to just trudge through it because come merciless difficulty come maps itll all prove to be deeply worth it once you get your first good unique item once you five link or six link your first item etc etc youll have nowhere to go but up that is until your character dies and you angrily uninstall or reroll a coc build screw coc builds theyre killing the game and trivializing the content alright ggg you caught me this was all really an elaborate ruse with the actual intent of this review being nothing more than a rant about coc builds coc builds are utterly faceroll and negate all strategic thought difficulty mechanics and build variety involved in this game also nerf lightning coil and blade vortex goty
i can see myself spending a lot of hours on this one im a sucker for games like these i dont have that many hours yet so im unsure of how much fun its gonna be in the endgame and if they still are working on the game with updates and such everytime i find a game like this it dies a few months later with no new content for now tho im having fun i like that you get a lot of chests from the different campaigns and the free five hour chest also nice that you can buy cards for ingame gold i also am a big fan of the fact you dont have to sit around and wait for energy to do stuff like in similar games
early access reviewgame is amzing better then all other battle royale games the graphics are amzing but still relativle easy to run love thats its only ww2 gun i do recommed adding anti tanke rifles the small amount of playyers in a battle make the game more fun as u dont run into people every ten seconds i highly recommend this game
this will be my first review i have ever done and it is because this game deserves it i loved hearthstone when it first came out but i feel it was very cookie cutter this game is much better much more strategic and a lot more fun definitely give it a try its free
product received for freeearly access reviewlook at the pictures on this page full of lies artbots continuous stream of nano beams megabots why are freejam doing this for money who would pay them if everyone hates them also if you like tanky get a mech if you like going fast well get a mech and put some rotors on it if you like to be as agile as a bunny get a mech its even more agile than a bunny see the first promotional images mech mech more mechs and mechs but what if you want to fly instead if you like tanky get a drone because it can flee with only five of the healthbar remaining if you like going fast get a drone if you like to be agile you know the answer the funny thing is even though the devs love drones theres not a single one to be found on the promotional images maybe they know that its cancerous but they dont want it to go
immerse yourself in a retro postapocalyptic world while experiencing state of the art modern advertising this is a beautiful game with ugly psychology this game is beautiful artistically and has great immersion even on pc for someone familiar with fallout its great to see an entire game designed in the style of vault boy end positive discussion herereward in rushing is the message that is routinely reinforced as you play rushing a room is a core game mechanic and something of a miniature gamble that you engage in to make progress you rush to get resources rush rush rush rushing brings rewards that is what the game tells you rush reward rush reward you must rush to get rewards that is what makes fallout shelters payordelay scheme so lucrative the game conditions you to rush then frustrates you with delays the way to move forward is to pay for nukacola speedups remember please that according to fallout lore vaults were social experiments done on stupid people for this game remove vault tech and replace it with bethesda this is a game that plays you im a patient player i havent spent a cent i know the game behind the game so i laugh at the things mentioned above i also enjoy the simcitylike challenge of balancing the little economy i send my guy out on a twentyfour hour mission and come back later but this game does indeed treat you like a rat in a skinner box its missions could be played by a foraging rat no joke i downvote this exceptional game because the overaggressive and psychologically exploitive system is not something i will encourage yes i will continue to play the game i find the real challenge is beating the game company itself in the paytoplay game when you play this game remember vault one hundred and fourteen interview eighty seven interviewer this is vaulttech interview eighty seven for the position of overseer for vault one hundred and fourteen the candidate has refused to give his real name and has only provided the name soup can harrysoup can harry thats right i aint telling you nothing my name is the name i call myself not the rank and number the government brands on me no sir interviewer fascinating mister um soupcan would you mind telling me why youre distrustful of bethesda soup can harry ive seen what they do gum up the works with red tape and bureaucracy take every hard earned cent and use it to fund their illuminati free mason sex parties im a free man i should be able to live as i see fit my taxes pay for them streets and alleys and dumpsters ill sleep where i wantinterviewer sir according to this you havent paid taxes in many years soup can harry i seen the back of them abraxo boxes not for consumption dont you tell me what to do ill eat what i wantinterviewer sir you may just be the perfect candidate how would you like to be the new overseer for vault one hundred and fourteen soup can harry i aint wearing no damn tie or pants
after one hoursi finally download it suck game yeah you wanna me register an account yeahyou got it but captcha wasnt come up my insight and always reminds me you fit into wrong captcha damn i didt see any captcha at all
gud game pvp cheaetrs get dealt with i know from experience botters dont get any problems i know with experience also the most popular bot for this can be cracked easily since they just use autoit2exe to compile it lulone thing they should do is actually make a desktop client like i dont want to play a mobile game on pc oh and you can have two steam accounts linked to the same duel links account e g i can bot on my duel links account but on another steam whilst playing csgo on this steam
well i dont really know if its bad or not now the gmae it self is great crisp vibrent graphics it runs great has great detail has amazing potential it is great but the dlcs oh the dlcs so im a teen that likes military history i really like all things related world war two vietnam and present day i really am facinated in tanks aircraftand ships now i own ksp and like making passanger planes but sometimes its fun flying a jet with real phisics but i wish i didnt have to spend freaking seventy so i can fly a plane over a beach now i know you have to make funds some how to keep the game going i get it my favorite military jet is probably the a10 people say its ugly with its stubby nose and is weird jets blah blah blah well i think its a magnificent sight who doesnt want a plane build around the gun but alastbecuase of the rediculous amount of money for one plane for a game i cant fly my dream bird do i want to drive a tankyes but i cant do i want to playout normandy yes but i cant do i want to fly a a10 yes but i cant im thirteen living in a small town so there is almost no way for me to do somthing like mowing lawns becuase some ones already doing that type of thing i cant get a job and i like to save my money instead of use it for a plane on a game i think the game is great but eagle and fighter really got to get there dlcs strait because if the rediculous pricing i cant buy any thing making the game real boaring real quick making me think of the game as just good instead of fantastic i know they need money but seven thousand and eighty for a beach and some planes and tanks is just stupid i dont mean to be rude but i could buy something that could last a life time were this could be wiped by somthing wrong with the game computer etc be really nice if they could put the stuff at a lower price and make stuff like the a10 and the joint forces pack i dont know free it a great game but its hard to like it if there is really nothing to do which is sometimes the case
world of tanks world of warplanes battlefield command and conquer renegade all in onehard to learn hard to master a truly awesome game and one of its kind the only mmofps out there
horribly unbalanced grind is horrible starting to become more and more p2w as the years go on horrible community devs refuse to acknowlege the problems in the game and just blatantly unbalanced in terms of tanks and armor the gameplay is fantastic it is much better than wot and has a lot of variety the game looks great and the tank and air gameplay is fun and challenging if you can put up with all of the other stuff then the game is for you if youre like me and actually like to win a game once in a while while playing your favorite tanks in the american line then this game is not for you
smite is my jam although too bad folks dont have manners through the interwebs foul language and poor sportsmanship youre just foul smite fans however the game is worth it support hirez
this game is so bad that i would litrealy drive all the way to the store buy the real game then drive to my friend to play monopoly with him irl reather than playing this game it is rigged as hell and so bad that the rolling cubes are in pattern that repeats it self and the chance card are mostly bad do not play this game ban the developers
played probably over two thousands hours of war thunder on my ps4 and my steam account gaijin really only cares about money bags and made the game a lot more recently cant recommend this game anymore
product received for freei love this game but im very annoyed i start the game and its cut off on both ends also i cant goto the games settings at all to try and fix resolution for it i tried the launch method for windowed and resolution and would not work what is up with this
ever since the latest update the game has been the loading times are longer the refresh rate of the screen is slower and most of the time the game doesnt even know what to do plus the servers keep on crashing one small thing that bothers me so much is the fact that we cant even test drive the cars anymore how am i supposed to try out a car before buying it if i dont even know how its going to feel
at first when i saw this game i saw a minecraft ripoff as it stands minecraft is losing its thrill and so have all the games like it but when i played this it was like a whole new world but with blocks it has a lot to do and is a lot of fun to play when i feel like relaxing and playing my laptop i reccommend you give this a try and not assume like i did when i first saw this game
very crappy matchmaking opponents too op bad graphics no first person view long loading screens unpolite and awfuly rude teammates that call you in many bad names even my grandmas toaster has a better frame rate and it also makes you crunchy bread heroes are called just like pornstars for example queen of pain crystal maiden bounty hunter silencer witch doctor or just sounds a little bit too homosexual lone druid razor batrider natures prophet beastmaster and tiny last but not least is magnus this hero does not only wield a name thats destined for a huge but his horn also looks like one too sadly heroes appearance is also poor meepo looks lika a rabbit that smokes weed before every round io is just a light bulb kunkka is the heihachi mishima from tekken morphiling is just water i think sven and juggernaut are twins storm spirit looks like an avarage asian man only he loves drinking energy drinks and watching tentacle porn too often natures prophet cannot even smell flowers because he has no possesion of a nose ogre magi has the nicest s hethey beat even cuties like mirana and windranger faceless void lets just call him eyeless dckhead all females look lets just say pretty bangable annddddd magnus name says it all lastly id like to say that all maps are identical which makes game boring after a while and games ending is too predictable all items that i buy always disappear starting the next round and i hate when games dont have easter eggs or other skins for characters if you have read this until the end listen to me listen to the voice of reason turn off the computer go outside and discover all the things the world can give to you if you dont well welcome to the dota nation
used to be a good fun game to play either by yourself or with friends but then greed greed ruins everything so when i last played this game it was a fun as heck f2p wwii dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system was not p2w and was well optimized with great graphics but then i heard what they did to the game and died a little they revamped the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level skill and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength this lead to said powerful planes witch consits of paid planes too to leak into the less powerful planes matches and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance after hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review i am not happy this game used to be great but then they ruined it tldr i would not give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system if they fix the system
early access reviewthe game has some issues when it has a glitch that prevents hyperspace when the game starts and requires a rejoin as well as some ping issues when other game pings run better than others possibly lack of many servers but besides that it runs smoothly even if its at a low fps you can see everything going on and the graphics are amazing as well as attention to detail one thing i look forward to seeing in this game is more ship damage like an ablity to ram a ship in a weak point and tearing it in two i look forward to continuing to support and play the game and its potential for the future
i own more hats and cosmetic items in this game than i own clothes in real life after two thousand hours spent blowing people up setting people on fire beating people to death with my bare fists pushing a large explosive device in a mining cart along a track trading hats for pieces of metal and being riddled with bullets by a heatseeking automatic turret i think its safe to say team fortress two is a pretty fun game never gets old fun to team up or even duel your friends and theres always more content around the corner freetoplay itll give you a good laugh at times and other times make you want to throw your monitor out the window in blind crimson rage
early access reviewi have to agree with everyone great game so far it is an alpha and it can be unstable it crashed twice in an hour of play and there arent many upgrades or customizations to ships but its a lot of fun i remember another reviewer saying its unbalanced i actually disagree each category of ship has a very distinct feel and great strategic potential the problem is that most people playing this game right now are just like you intrigued gamers just trying it out a bit because of this no ones coordinating and no ones really trying to win you also cant currently change ship types in game so if the other team is full of assassins and snipers and your team is made of nothing but flagships youre going to get your butt handed to you but if you happen to get on a balanced team its pretty fun get it try it out love it anticipate the future
holymotherof goodnes gracious slapped on a goat this is goodof course there are a few bad parts which i shall start off with the shadow arena portals should be a bit more common it took me fifteen minutes at the least to reach the uber and i have yet to find onethe enemies and dungeons should be more varied with better traps and different attacks fpr instance or maybe a leveling system for the enemies varying in levels so you can farm from the smallest to the largest bosses need to be varied and more stronger as well now onto the great partthe game runs smoothly most of the timethe quests in the top right teach how to do most thingsthe free random loot you can get is greatthe fact you can make your weapon look like a different one and keep the good stats is amazing i havent seen any other game do thismy friends can teleport to me music ear candy
the best hat simulator to date this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearables in a variety of styles and colours with the ability to trade purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack you can finally feel comfortable knowing that youve wasted your life and once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items you can show them off to other pathetic losers ingame you can also express your poor creativity by naming describing and painting your items with a large array of bland depresssing colours become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make miniscule profit off of hourlong trades oh and you can also shoot stuff a mustbuy for all basement dwellers and fat losers one thousand and ten
early access reviewhey fj im sure you guys got money earned from robocraft right and it cant be only a little amount right and robocraft is a good game everyone hope believe that right then pls fix the ing trash serverand you will see the comments and make improvement right
early access reviewi love this game especially since they made it less of a grind it still takes a long time i unlock new guns and yes i do consider this a pay to win game but its the good kind of pay to win game if the other guy bought a mg42 you could still easily beat him with your starter weapon if you are better than him really the only problem i have with the game is with the op m1m2 carbine you do not need any skill to use this it has the fastest fire rate no recoil its accurate and a four shot kill i can easily spray enemies down with this gun from 200m away even if they have longer ranged guns
this a must play and its for free99 i have played the the other neverwinters the clasic action rpg so vague you end up wandering in over powering lands this game was made so you could go go go it takes away from the openness a bit but this gives you a fun start helps you to come back for more once it realy gets tuff
i think the dev did some research on objects that can scare humans you may not like the style of the graphics but this game is the creepiest horror game i have ever played all of the sound effects can scare you especially the cardboard in different level different monsters will chase you which makes the game more and more creepy therefore ignore the style of graphics and download the game i am sure you wont regret trying it although you may regret trying it because it is very scary game for all horror lovers download it nowtips if you are too scared turn off speaker and play
early access reviewits free for a limited time so get it quickly the gameplay is awesome altough there are not that many game modes yet but more will be added and the graphics look pretty neat its everything i ever wanted i highly reccommend this game
early access reviewthe learning curve is too deep im usually good with learning curves but could never figure this one out so if you arnt good with very difficult things then dont play this game cause it is difficult also none of the elements balance out eachother the main story is so difficult that on the second deck i wanted i couldnt beat any of the bosses you take your pick on why this game is bad
early access reviewi am an advid ccg player high level gwent player and constant legend rank elder scrolls legends player so you can believe my review this game lacks creativity within its decks and their is only a few top tier decks from what i can see the game is not pay to play but its pay to progress so dont expect to be at the top unless you have two hundred hours for grinding or two hundred dollars usd the game lacks variety in its play style i versed the same decks copy and pasted so long story short it is full of netdeckers i despise netdeckers who lack creativity and go for what is statisically overpowered rather than fun unfortunately all card games suffer from statistically overpowered cards but most get fixed eventually eternal cards for over a year have had the same broken cards at the top with no editing to their power levels the developers are direwolf and i now understand why direwolf has recently been replaced by a new development team for the elder scrolls legends theyre incapable of making a balanced game but maybe its intentional for money grabbing i would say ditch this game unless you have a small brain with a long attention span for boring games and love brooding over new players with your pay to play netdecked build i say seek a different ccg eternal one hundred and ten i got one point for having yeti cards other than that their is no selling point the artstyle is tradgic too colorful seems to be illustrated by an obnoxious kid with too many crayons
fun to play with friends at least until your team mates start being toxic and tell you that youre doing the worst and theyll report you for no reason unless you disable chat i do not recomend the community in game is toxic as hell
early access reviewa thumb up for this game yea i know this game have a lot of bugs but its normal its a pre alpha why i give a thumb up because this game get very often a great update freejam the devs are very often on the forum and read our wishesbugsoff topics and robot creations this is not a matter of course but they do this and i like thisokey back to the game pros many updates for creativ user is this game a good choise the developers freejam are very often on the forums the fights are short you can play this when ever you want the weapons are really balanced if the servers down freejam are so nice and give promotion codes one day premium overwolf work with robocraft the game is very fast to download the grafic is interessingcontras a lot of bugs the chat is to colorful for mesrry for my bad english ramon aka hatsunemiku
permadeath with a shop next to the spawn point let that soak in i would play it but i dont feel like dealing with that dynamic right now free to play though so i wont knock it but pay to win if youre impatient
"helloi am a passionate dota2 player i generally play at least sixty seven hours of dota2 everyday and i am trying to improve myself day by day i have never used any cheat programs recently ive got a lot of reports from dota two community i can see the reason of getting reported every game of dota2 because of that i get a lot of reports from enemies and my teammates i dont even abandon any game i am a human being too people get angry i get angry too but most of my games i try to be chill when there is no support i pick support when nobody buys courier i buy courier even if i play offlane in that game every two week i play two hundred thousand, two hundred and fifty hours of dota2 i really love to play this game i buy compendiums dota as well i like your products so i believe that a misjudgement happened to me just because people dont like my playing or i play good on one hero doesnt mean they can report me i would like to see if you guys can investigate my six months ban im looking forward to hearing from you thank you in advance have a great day"
you may notice that i have zero hrs on record playing dcs world thats because i play it through the eagle dynamics dcs world launcher i had that originally with some dlc before steam offered itas far as i know digital combat systems is the only software company that is dedicated to making true to life simulations if your into flight simulators and you love the military planes this is a must have the dlc that you buy for this is well worth it these are not your run of the mill games the learning curve is quite high but if you dedicate the time to learning the sims you will know what it feels like to be a combat pilot hell it took me multiple nights of playing just to learn how to start up the a10 and you think that its easy to take off in a p51 mustang thats what i thought too until i went turning to the left on the runway smack dab into a building i didnt know that you need to compensate for p factor hell didnt know what p factor was until started playing this simulator what im trying to say is that when it comes to simulators for the pc it dont get any closer to the real thing than it does with dcs simulators
this game is a â â â â ing joke this is not random this is just laughing at players face you cant do anything you dont have a chance to even show some skills this game is just â â â â ing you so hard that you dont even have fun playing with your friends just buy normal monopoly some beer pizza and meet your friends cause games like thisâ â â â â â are taking your life away in polish jaâ â â â â â â â â â co zaâ â â â â â â â
interesting concept but severely lacking in any support or instruction for brand new players i was literally dropped into the game world with no idea what i was supposed to be doing and no tutorial or guide missions or anything just dumped in the middle of nowhere with a flashlight after wandering around for a while aimlessly with nothing happening i just gave up and quit the game also i found zero pve servers despite the game being set up to be able to have some youd think that beginner servers would be pve while players got used to the game mechanics but apparently the devs couldnt be bothered doing that either110 great concept decent grafics for it but massively lacking in any kind of new player supports common to pretty much every other game on the market huge let down and in its current form is not worth bothering with ill come back and try this game again in the future after the devs have had time to expand it and upgrade my review as appropriate
i installed the free version on my computer using an oculus rift none of my controls work on my xbox game controller or my motion controllers i cannot stand the fact you have to use keyboard and monitor also i did finally get into the menu and start a flight but none of the buttons worked it states this works with oculus no it dosnt
early access reviewi really enjoyed my first match of this game it reminds of me star conflict meets league of legends capture the points kill the enemy capture the main base super fun very colorful and pretty intense
smite is one of the best mobas i have played besides dota two the majority of the community is very friendly and helpful i would recommended smite to anyone that is new to mobas it isnt easy to get the hang of but after about one hundred hrs you should have a good understanding of the game
ive played this game for a while now i think about twenty hours at this point on different worlds my world my friends private world and a public world i havent even fully explored everything in the game yet though i do have a good understanding of the game imo lol and id say this is a pretty good free to play alternative to another well known block mining game cough minecraft cough pros free to playlots to do addicting easy to spend hours in a single session playing and losing track of timelets you be very creative the name says it all lolcan play with friendshuge worlds to explorecons sonetimes theres lag when moving or maybe thats just my bad computer lol it doesnt really take away from the game imo but its noticeableyou have to pay for the pro version for certain features i especially want this for the flashlight bc im terrified of the dark mines however these features arent nescessary for the game and you can play the game entirely without it but if youre a free to play player you cant make a new world this means you can only play in your starter world a friends world or a public world i kind of wish f2p players could at least make one more world but if you want to create another world for whatever reason you need to buy the pro version however its a one time payment and its not too terribly expensive so its not that bad my rating seven hundred and ten
this game started out very promising it was a fun grind with lots of different permutations of options in terms of towersupgradesbloons however when you start playing battle modes and go against anyone above one hundred win two hundred they just spam you with either blimps or ing zebra bloons blimps you can sell your and buy stuff quick enough to stop but when they spam regen zebra bloons its game over one hundred of the time ive lost thousands from 100s to actual two thousands and four thousands bets against these stupid spamming kids there is literally no way to counter it no matter what i do i dont try to do it to others because thats dirty and i say late game and mean it when somebody says late game and then zebra or blimp spams you early you should have an option to block them so you never have to play against them or with them again there should be a report option for the idiots who say late game and then dont late game honestly its the dirtiest thing ever its like saying you havent looked at your cards in poker and having the nuts or saying youll quickscope battle someone in cod and then knifing them or pulling out a machine gun i dont know how you sleep at night if you play like this but hopefully with a knife through your ing skull when someone you spam out like a noob tracks you down and kills you in your ing bed im ing tired of losing all my money and having to wait eight hours over and over for spins because im way ahead and some ing kid spams me with ing zebra t good game if you want to break your mousekeyboardclosest thing to your computermonitor however if youre a rational human being dont download this game even though its free itll cost you more than other games because of the rage it induces not to mention there are a bunch of trolls in the comments and in most games absolute trash you only get to pick three towers which is meant to be tactical but leaves lower levels stuck on certain towers having not had the money to purchase higher leveltiers yet and forces you to pick banana farm as one of your towers banana farm forced meta is just ing gay
a quite frankly fantastic hunting game that deserves to be played because of its rich content and unique experience but utterly ruined by the pay2enjoy model this game is attrocious when it comes to nickle and diming its customers everything that is not a rabit or a specific kind of deer will cost you money you will find no enjoyment in this game without paying money and that is its biggest sin rather than making this a fun game where you can pay for boosts silly clothes and extras they made this into a hunting game where you cant hunt ninety of the animals in the game without paying a monthly feedisastrous and crippling to what would have othewise been a fantastic game heck if i had bought this at thirty for just the singleplayer id be a happy customer however im not sinking over sixty a year into this game for occasional play this is a game you play when you want a switch from things want to relax or just want to see if you can finally catch that animal you saw a couple of weeks ago it is not worth the bloody mmo like subscription fees in any sense of the word do not buy anything because this game doesnt give two s about your enjoyment and if you play be prepared to be bored out of your ing mind after your twentieth mule deerps dont be deceived by my steam stats i have played this game since twenty twelves into twenty thirteens and early twenty fourteens and got thoroughly sick of it each time that i just hit the uninstal button after killing my thousandth animal that i could harvest because i needed to pay money for a license
early access reviewat this stage this game not even working took me about fifteen restarts in order to get this game to load when it finaly loaded i was running it at 1015fps on low settings on high end gaming pc
creativerse is incredibly fun for those who enjoy the farming and building genre at times gameplay can be very repetitive and early gameplay leaves you feeling incredibly underpowered that being said once you start to get some decent gear and understanding of the game it does become very enjoyable the devices and mechanisms can make for incredibly fun and entertaining buildings and the massive world is fun to explore all in all a very fun experience
early access reviewawesome game ive tried a few magic hearthstone gwent etc this is the perfect balance between hearthstone and magic love it been playing on steam and my iphone and i cant stop i havent put one dime in it yet and still get hours of play in it i strongly recommend this if you are looking for a good ccg
early access reviewlazy developers and a smart crew tat keep saying its all goood when its not abusers or exploiter free pass they say 15days block aka vacations is enough for this peopleif they get it at alleconomy flooded with their gold ppl transfering itens flying in pvp and the worst is the optimization
to everyone saying it is unoptimized you can configure the ini yourself and the game runs great hopefully they will address this to improve the experience for those that do not know how or are too lazy to do this themselves they also fixed the issue of players getting stuck on the splash screen on the official early access launch and it was only a problem for the two days for those who prepurchased and we were compensated for that with twenty of in game currency ive also had a solid connection since i started playing with no lag whatsoever so i dont know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag as for the game it is a blast combat is fluid intuitive and makes pvp really intense the open world factions based like wow pvp is always a good time cant wait for the upcoming pvp content in the next week or two sidequests are actually fun but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically recieve a quest to kill that monster pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster you also can gain dungeon points doing thesepet system is awesome hilarious and adds quite a bit of depth to the game there are a crazy amount of petsmounts to tame you can upgrade pets to gain different abilities and the same goes with mounts you use other pets as an ingredient but it can be a little grindy it is an mmo talents are really fun and what you craft is actually valuableworthwhile there is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting gear can be upgraded and infused and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more noobs it also looks great and there arent just a ton of reskins of similar items there could be more sets but what is there is very nice i just hope they add more content like they say they are going to as i will be here for awhile only complaint is nerf guardian and add more stuff classes levels end game contenti hope the community doesnt let such a beauty die id love to see this game flower into its full potential

smites characters is actual religous gods you play these religous gods you can learn their lore you finally figure out how to pronounce their names you see how baddasssexy gods are this game is totally on the top three mobas and it has a lowkey eduactional value aswell1010
product received for freeyou shoudnt judge the game by what people say even if they spent six years and so on on the game the games f2p with years of worth of content for you to explore i have been looking for an mmo to play thats worth investing my time time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap i have six hours on record i wont lie to you game is good try it it has everything an mmo needs to have and more the game isnt ruined by what people say it isnt pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing if you are looking for that classic feel look no other this games got history it has attidute and it will consume you just give it a go you can always uninstall for more information about subscriptions etc here http eq2zam
i will never recomend this game the matchmaking is super bad if you are a low rank like me the other players start bulling you baceuse they are diamond gods the system dont match you with players of your lever is do bad the players start saying to report the person because is new o o my friend got reported so many times because he didnt select the god they want it and got suspended on smite las update suspention wave smite only answer to him in small word you got reported we will suspend you without checking if the report is truth or not
"early access reviewill echo what many others are saying no just no i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an mmo but given that bless has been an ongoing project since twenty twelves and released in three regions prior to steam there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years trust me save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first 60million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west promotionmarketing they advertised this game as local optimized and new combat mechanism upon 2days early of early release this is not the case by a long shot they marketed to your hype and released none of it matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas i get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better optimzation is just not there you have to edit your own ini files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine 3dx9 yeah a dinosaur new combat after many complained about the new combat beign removed except for zerkers to polish it more this this is not beign transparent after happily stealing dlc money to make it clear if they said it in advance many wouldve been ok in waiting emmisary eventwas used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release emmisaries were youtubers to tryrepresent or even help hype the game many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs apparently some drama went down with them too needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status early 2day launch needless to say that it was a waste of time one thing is to wait in queue another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a linetowait which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option thats 2008ish issues as of this post its still iffy believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation collectors editionskinitems are all character bound no way to move them no way to given them to an alt with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join good luck your pack just got wasted am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason also the lumena ingame currency was character bound they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more problem here is they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt see a trend in game they warn you its nonrefundable yeah right people got their money back nice try servers they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen so while opening new ones are nice it splits up premade guilds and your precious already burned founders items poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here planning of only one server vs oceanic south america north america carribean get the point roadmap they have a vague one laid out most of it is the same from the three other regions but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time therefore many of earlier region content was striped away heres the thing when you meet a person and give that first handshake that first introduction it says alot about who you are neowiz who are you becoming neowizoverall there have been games that pulled through and made it work do you know what they did differently open forums discussions podcasts whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with transparency warframe and ff14 are to name a few here you have been hearing feedback yes but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you come out of that closet face us more often and get that feedback and just talk talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship also lets say your afraid you dont want to face an audience then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with in short i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you neowiz make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention at that point what happens to you should you prove to turn this around and do better then ill update my review just no until then moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a nonrefund early of early release lack of transparency you tried original post may 30th edit and follow up 66hmmm where to start i still wouldnt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone make your own informed decision for what thirty thousand, one hundred and fifty is worth to you soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the games release from there a few patches that as i mentioned above catered to whomever yells the loudest some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf not to mention that each patch note doesnt include full disclosure still for example first two dungeons used to drop gear guaranteed each boss now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have rng of a drop rate for rng of it beign of your class events boy are they throwing events left and right the last gathercrafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or altbank content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised dx11 was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above dupe items scandal it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed it demonstrates a rolled back build further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content not a full rework ff14 went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell as for those involved in the duping few days ban and items were kept so they say apparently they are listening to feeback through their discord and with some emissaries i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within two weeks perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions performance performance sixty million later perfomance they already stole your money and mine with lack of transparency whats a few please wait more soon to make you more gullible sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience twitter reddit the fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could 1shot things now that adjustments make sense no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combolinks system works its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down read practice but they seem addicted to preference already latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound this on its own is unnecessary to founders gold is account bound and am willing to bet thats an issue on the code unintended yet the ingame dollarcurrency lumina is not"
all these casuals with less than twenty hours playtime dont know anything at first you might think why would anyone play this game its just another clicker game thats where everyone is wrong how many clicker games have animu girls that moan none how many clicker games have a customizable waifu none how many clicker games have enemies that all have boobs once again none this game is definitely on top of the list of clicker games moans and boobs ten outta ten best game ever and as for those saying they regret the fact that people can see that they played this dont be stay proud you played this amazing masterpiece
early access reviewto sum it up pay to win you start off playing training missions and for the most part is is quite fun the games mechanics are not on par with other ww2 shooters out there such as dod source or more importantly red orchestra two but youre willing to look past that because of the overarching goal to win the war and the fact that the games progression gives you incentives to keep playing unfortunately its when you rank up and step out of training missions into the campaign missions where the game comes undone whilst it is refreshing to finally see the game as it was meant to be played that is with multiple goals and not just the domination gametype in the training missions youll often be outnumbered or outnumber the enemy team and crush them not only that but youll start playing against people who have spent inordinate amounts of money on ridiculous weapon mods that will one shot you and theyll also take 3x the amount of damage of a normal person due to some insane perk they unlocked via money yes you can grind to attain some of these advantages but it is a long and arduous grind not something the average person could hope to attain im willing to have some iffy balance in a ww2 game seeing as in real life battles are not always fair but when you get the drop on a guy who is peddling a bike you put six rounds into him and then he jumps off his bike only to one shot kill you it is incredibly frustrating something that i very much get in a ro2 match is the feel of war bullets whizzing over my head soldiers writhing in pain artillery raining down close to me all these things are just non existent in hg half the time you wont even hear the shot that killed you the audio in general is awful pros progression is definitely there you feel like there is an overarching goal to win the war cons wonky mechanics not as good as other current ww2 shooters on the market pay to win or if you are not fond of that term pay to advance awful balancing no visceral war feeling recommendation go buy red orchestra two
matchmaking is not that bad but there is room for some improvments specially in ranked duel also this is not p2w by any means sure there are some paid events here and there but they dont affect gameplay at alland the community is not toxic compared to other games like cs go if you end up playing this game please please please dont instalock i admit i used to do it alot one last thing loki cancer just dont pick him ok
early access reviewhorrible game even more broken than magic combos ranked matches you bronze with golden and above ranked players make no sense they have better cards and better knowledge of the game cards you didnt even know existed its rly bad
free to play but pay money if you want to win online matches the online mode unevenly ranks you into matches with people who have been playing for at least two years or more or just people who have paid money to have better cards the only thing worth doing for free in this game is the story mode and then uninstalling
the release of the elder scrolls legends on steam is great news for fans of ccg competitive card games and the elder scrolls franchisefirst and foremost it is not paytowin each and every card can be crafted with soul gems equivalent of hearthstone dust now those of you migrating from hearthstone might bring up grinding fortunately very less grinding is required and here are the reasons why one you can play against the expert ai in practice mode and get fifteen gems for each win this is hard capped at three hundred gems per day with this rate you can get a legendary card in just four days if you are so inclined for comparison in hearthstone it takes you a month to get a legendary two this game will award you cards gold just for leveling up your character the soul gems awarded to a player at the beginning are very generous and can help you craft cards needed to make a budget deck i have been playing since just three days and already have forty four of the cards three you can always play the soloversus arena to get higher rewards depending on how much you win three wins will net you more than you invest reasons why you should play tesl over hearthstone one less rng more skill there are no cards with random effects yet and the game is actually surprisingly balanced having no overpowered class or archetype as such two with the way blizzard is approaching expansions in hearthstone you will have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to even play slightly competitive four thousand and three the rune and prophecy mechanics discourage aggroface hunter face is the place decks which form much of the meta in lowerranked games effectively making low ranked hearthstone games stale four an f2p player can actually compete with walletwarriors providing heshe is willing to be patient for a while not hearthstone patient lol there are many f2p players who have hit the legend rank absolute highest rank i see a bright future for this game hearthstone always left a void which other ccgs failed to fill this game just might be the one
prosanxiaty inducing gameplay which is what a horror game should have interesting visual style good comical momentslots of jump scaresconswalking simulatori really with there was more to this game than moving from room to room running from misc badies perhaps puzzles or obsticals that increase difficulty when the slower monsters are fallowing you however for what it is spookys house of jump scares is great interesting enough to keep you captivated for long periods of time
this game consists of many half naked waifus and domestic violence disguised by the waifus moans be it pleasure or pain who cares right its quite incredible because you can beat your while you beat the waifu a whole new level of next generation gaming is now realised thanks to the perfection of sakura clickersyou can even expand the realism of this game by cuddling up to a body pillow of x hot anime grill and enjoy an evening of domestic violence and the moaning waifu together this game is flawless i give it a solid ten because of its perfection and not because of the stiffy i got
the developers ruined this game they can t a program a simple hit box properly and multiple other things they removed the dodge for most cases i have a suggestion for the developers stop making new legends and fix the problems already existing within the game if you don t fix those problems those problems will be in the new legends you people make the developers obviously do not listen to their player base since people have complained about this and still are what a ing joke
early access reviewthis game realy need a report function and a way of muting players when you have to play with little kids that think its funny to spread racist and nazi all the time it can get very anoying
early access reviewthis game needs to have some sort of practice mode because if youre new and just starting off you cant compete against everyone else who has been playing for hours already and has a better handle of things with a decent learning curve it doesnt make sense to practice waiting a few minutes each time to find a squad and deploy only to play for fifteen seconds before you get killed how am i supposed to practice and get better and whats the use of spending more time setting up and entering a game as opposed to actually playing it when you get killed almost immediately no use i heard there was a death match mode previously that was useful for practice and getting better but they apparently removed that so im moving on to a new game bye
early access reviewmore optimized and more fun than pubg with lots of unique ideas that make it stand out from other battle royale games this is the most fun ive had with the genre and im glad to see roe is getting the recognition it deserves by placing in steams top ten as of late
waited for this game for six years since it was first previewed and couldnt wait for it tried it in russia korean rebuild and japan all of these versions were better despite the optimization issues and slow combat japanese version was actually ok in the combat just needed a slight increase in speed then came the na version cheats were everywhere and dupes still existed from previous versionsregions that were known about for years optimization was still never fixed cheatersdupers received slaps on the wrist absurd gear time releases made the factions imbalanced quickly server merges made it even worse despite the company knowing that it would be this way the people representing the company in the discord were terrible childish dismissive to legitimate complaints about not only the game but other staff members rules not enforced ie person would be kicked after five minutes of voicing concern over the game yet someone with a racist slur in their name was brought up to every single staff member and it took five hours before someone would do anything about it after bringing it up a second time overall a terrible experience in game and interaction with the company in the discord i had minor issues with optimization but dealt with it for awhile finally decided that they werent going to fix any legitimate complaints and that this version was going to suffer the same fate as all of the other regions any new version that came out would get the spotlight and the previous ones would be forgotten about this version is about to get the same treatment because of the xbox1 version thats in the works
early access reviewunless devs wont make crappy decisions to speedup alpha to beta release process under the pressure of investors it could be made into some glorious spaceships pvp game eve never been
early access reviewall the memories of playing brawl on wii years back came flooding in super fun game with awesome characters downloaded it today and ive been playing for four hours straight now i wont lie tho i think the game is awesome but there are some cons aswell as its many perks perkseasy controllersvery alike ssbb which is good to meroom for mechanicsintresting characterscozy graphicsfun modes to play with friendsconsyou have to save up a lot of gold to buy one so called legend and the only ones you can play for free are the ones who are on the weekly free rotation a bit buggy some times for me atleastonly way to get skins and new weapons is to buy in game money for real money and yes theres skinsnot to many characters to choose fromfew items to use in matchesbut as i said i wont lie and i enjoy the game really much the flaws are somthing i personally can live with recommended
i played neverwinter for a long time i go tot where i would buy vip every month because it made things easier like being able to pull up a map and go where you want no matter where you are i did not have to pay to play but the option was there if you want to i played a long time i have taken a long break and am back playing again its a good online rpg and i made some friends when i played before its really good for a free game i recommend it and the game can be played without buying anything get together with some friends and play together that will be more fun
i dont get this ive been waiting to connect for over an hour once i load the loading screen it says disconnected from the server all the time and four times i finally got to join and it says youve been killed by a zombie wtf is happening
imbalanced tank fighting german tanks seem to have paper for armor its a common joke that this game is biased to russians but the reality is that it is true the grind is a pain to follow and youll end up being targets for people who have premium tankshave grinded for hours without end just go find a better tank game cause this is no good

early access reviewseems interesting so far id need more time to play as the game develops the concept seems good in theory the flight controls do seem a bit sluggish to me id enjoy them more if they were closer to actual space flight lateral movements arent possible the controls behave more of a earthbound aircraft than spaceflight
for the first four attempts at playing this 1st the screen went black just at the part you never wanted it to full of loot night coming in and out in the open you would be forgiven for thinking this is a plot or i just got hacked and when i did get back into the server yea i was dead but spawned one hundred yards from my loot 2nd graphic glitch then total crash of my machine not frikin happy with that at all oh and before you get into spouting update your system and drivers well they were just updated the day before trying this and ive been ok for the last six machines i have built 3rd another black screen from nowhere but the play went on as i could hear the grunting sponge heads close to me however i did recover the screendont ask i hit multiple keys to get it back somehow4th another lockup black screen again and finally i got the screen back only to find i had been kicked for not playing lol what a load of but then the fifth time i got to play for a further four hours without a glitch hack lockupkick or any problems at all ithink the ten yr old hacker had to go to bed for school the next day only kiddin there guys but when i did get a good run at it i got the feeling it was an aftermath clone with some good improvements like the shop and the bar and such seven hundred and ten i give it seven out of ten mostly because its free to dload and playwith a little more attention to removing the graphic freezes the author could ask a fair price for the game its worth a go if you can get a few hour play without any problems oh btw i didnt change the server or the country eu in all the game play
early access reviewthis is a great game for an early excess who ever reading this buy it so there will be more people to play withagainst d it has pretty simple controls and doesnt have that many buttons or things to consider you can jump right in after tutorial and have some funif you are looking for a game that is more complicating taking into account of many aspects within the game like eve then this might not be the game for you hope to see more from the developers
everyone who reads this have played offlineonline diablo ii beaten in minimum five times and still havin thoughs of returning for one more round also most of us migrated to diablo three after playing it of numerous hours and seasons we can say this with pure honesty this is what diablo three should have looked like end of story ripdiablo4
fun game with some interesting ideas that falls apart into a p2w mess if you really try to play it like a traditional mmoit has a massive amount of content both from the development team and usergenerated through their map editor and really you could do a lot worse if youre just looking to waste some time and have some fun on a free game its fun even if you play it as a singleplayer action game i rate this game three out of five paywalled races
early access reviewcan offer great fun at zero cost if you play the game for the dailies and in between other activitiesgames you can be competitive andor have fun has a short single player campaign that works more as a tutorial from holding your hand on the first steps to chasing after you with a m9a17 flamethrower campaign includes rewards from single random cards to entire starter decks aside from the campaign single player offers a puzzle mode for mediocre rewards the main focus of the puzzles is entertainment however a lot of the puzzles offer insights on obscure mechanics that otherwise would take a lot of experimenting to figure out the gauntlet mode also under single player is what the name implies go through all the bouts with an increasingly difficult ai to recieve gold the f2p currency and cardscard packs it is free to participate in which is reasonable given the rage it induces with bs ai at higher tiers for people that are there for just the gold it is very punishing as a singl defeat takes you out and not until the fifth out of seven victories will you start seeing any worthwhile rewards the forge mode is a cheaper draft mode against the ai as it is cheaper the rewards are also inferior accessible to new players and good to fetch faction specific colors win or lose you get to keep the picked cards forge mode forces you to use a two color deck so you can limit what you get with the first few picks if you win all your fights you should get enough gold to participate again even a bit of profitunder the pvp flag you have the casual and ranked game types which are common in most games these days there is a season reward for ranked and draft more on this game type below casual and ranked are free to compete in there is also an event mode under the pvp section which varies i do not recommend participating unless you have a good collection otherwise youll just be feeding other people getting reward packs at regular value and wasting precious currency that could be better spent under forge ordraft a very generous draft system you pick fortyeight cards out of four packs paying a bit extra for this opportunity twenty victory or loss will get you the fortyeight cards but do try your best as rewards arent shabby at all and if you score nice on the rank ladder you get even more rewards even being bad if you participate in five draft sets you will get at the very least an extra pack at the end of the season topping this off you have daily doable quests that can be exchanged once per day for a different quest also you have periodic theme quests three days i think where you get a free theme deck and are asked to win five times with a deck with those colours not necessarily the one offered it is a very good game do yourself a favour and go through the basic campaign and play twenty three matches in each game mode before you come to a decision
despite all the reactions youll get from lovers and hater this game is freetoplay so i do recommend anyone to try it if you like it then continue playing it but if you dont then no harm is done and just uninstall it from your system its that easy cant get easier than that well you can just not play the game but do you want to do that without satisfying your curiousity remember human is curious of nature just like cats except trying this game wont kill ya personal opinion of the game i like it and currently liking it a lot since its based on one of my favorite past time dungeons dragons doesnt matter any edition coz im a fan of all of it if youre a real dnd fan and not a dnd purist who tends to stick to just one rulegameplay then this is a game for you mebe just until you finish the main storyline or get to level seventy with one or more characters
certainly a building game i enjoy i have high hopes and cant wait to see the improvements coming soon i think the best thing about this game is that it is a great f2p in that its fun to get good packs and build cool things while friends can still come and play with you very popular game with my gaming group brickbarons want to see what i did check out my base at darkjserverby darkj200 and teleport to dio the creative or look up my adventure lab excape artistic adventure by dio the creative pros create epic cool bases and fill em with lootmany friends can join with little problemspay money to get stuff invite friends to your base for freestarbound like logic as in turning lights on or opening doors and such cons you have to start over for every server or worldsometimes blueprints are consistant and that is niceteleporters can cause lag like a lotlimited f2p settings kind of forces you to play servers instead of your own worldnon creative grind its a liniar grind not a lot of creativity there i would like you to see this link for a large list of suggestions i dont make these for every game i play i post ideas here as i get themhttps steamcommunity
i have been trying since the first week of june twenty eighteens when i purchased these items to get the ww2 missions to work for the p51d i puchased the normandy map and the ww2 asset pack all i get to fly is free flight dog fight against a couple of bf109s i have tried to fly bomber escort find ground targets etc to no availi have asked numoerous times for help from norm eagle dynamics support but this issue is never resolvedi have asked for a refund on the nomandy map and the ww2 asset pack and was told thart it has been to longi have been asking for help from the startno more purchases from me until this is correctedi will now seek legal assistance just for the principle of itat this time i do not recommend this game due to the lack of supporti will edit this review if satisfaction is received
no reason to have this on pc play the original wot it is also free and is better in every way and the graphics settings in wot do go down if your pc can play this it can play wot on low just fine
a mediocre mobile game gorged with such grotesque microtransactions as premium ammunition premium consumables paywalllocked vehicles and equipment paywalllocked upgrades paytoskip grind monthly subscription benefits and paywalllocked cosmetics keep your money and your time away from these golddigging wretches and play something less willing to throw away all dignity for the contents of your wallet
the only game that makes you your pants if you see a flying objectthe only game that lets you shoot down planes in a cas aircraft and makes you feel good about itthe only game that has the satisfying feeling of actually destroying somethingthe only game that lets you eject when things get friskythis isnt a gamethis is a simulator
its very much a mobile style game and it has microtransactions but you dont need to purchase anything to have fun in fact the depth and options in this game put a lot of these selfdescribed triplea games to shame it may not be right for you but its free to try quick learning curve if you like strategy puzzles rpg sims theme parks and 4x builders you will find something in here to enjoy im runnning win ten with no issues on a top end rig pleasant surprise five of five guys
early access reviewwell its really not bad but its not that good either i did enjoy my time playing it though however i can see how it would get dull pretty fast worth a try you got nothing to lose
good when you figure out the controls or when you figure out to configure your controller but its free and of course you have to pay for some cars you want but thats your desicion
early access reviewaside from all of the bugs that usually plague mmos during launch i e server queues lag and disconnects the game is really bad right off the bat i noticed how horrible the graphics were for everything besides the characters and beasts armors would looks splotchy and blurred while edges on many objects were not smooth at all the voice over choices available for character voices seemed as if it was just the same person repeating words with the sound being slightly distorted to make it different while creating my character i found that there were a lot of missing features and options that would have made it stellar features such as the ability to change the fur color using a choice of basic spectrums was outright missing colors such as black silver or white were all simply missing from their color palette i guess the devs have never seen the color black on fur before another thing that threw me off was that every customized character image i managed to save was faction locked which is infuriating in itself if one wishes to remake their character on a different server now on to the abysmal game play the movement system uses the old hold rmb to turn the camera with wasd for moving the character around that would have been tolerable if only there was an option to remap keybinds there wasnt even one as far as i could tell after searching through the entire ui tldr bless online is another mmo flopoverall rating one hundred and ten
early access reviewif you dont mind playing with hackers and find a good server without any in then this game is fantastic fun if you do mind this then dont playalso if you do play only aim for the head as hitting the body will result in your death all custermisables are pad for with real world moneygameplay is fast like cod and you buy weapons like in csgoso be it the graphics are a little out dated but all in all a fun litte fps
the developers of robocraft are now just money hungry like my friend told me robocraft is now pay to win crap the developers are now just money hungry to actually have fun you have to buy premium which is expensive this game is crap soooo to conclude this you freejam your buisness model is i am not playing this any more you freejam im done edit almost two more years after writing this i still think this game is literal and a bad free to play game
early access reviewnever gonna give you upnever gonna let you downnever gonna run around and desert younever gonna make you crynever gonna say goodbyenever gonna tell a lie and hurt younever gonna give you upnever gonna let you downnever gonna run around and desert younever gonna make you crynever gonna say goodbyenever gonna tell a lie and hurt you
early access reviewbalance isnt done right i got instant killed every time by the proto seeker weapons are also too expensive plus with this new proto seeker and missle launcher and aeroflak theres literally no point in playing air vehicles matchmaking also sucks i dont actually like the new update where u can install multiple weapons on a robot it makes every robot almost identical well i havent played this game for long so i may be wrong but i wont recommend this at all in my opinion good concept but not done right every free to play game ever most of them
early access reviewtoday ill be reviewing robocraft or what is left from it after the amount of updates to make devs more money so to start this off robocraft was a great game i played it a long time ago when there were tiers the system worked like this you buy an item the item has robot ranking if your robot ranking is high enough you advance to next tier where only bots from the same tier are or from higher if you had a party the way the money worked was pretty straight forward you can buy with real money special points which can get you anything from tech points to the weapons you cant afford but as much as i can say it was pretty balanced and not pay2win the system is currently really terrible because of multiple reasons pretty much you can share your robot dont take this the wrong way its a nice touch that you can try other players but this pretty much killed the must for building your own so much stuff was changed tech tree was completelly removed so now everyone can buy anything this means you can get against yourself five lockon missile launchers that are pretty much undodgable unless you have an obstacle between you and the robot that shoots them the thing i loved in old robocraft was the amount of free premium codes there were so many premium codes for free to help you climb i feel like its rare to have any currently the most terrible thing however is that you no longer drop raw money from battles depending on your position in ladder you get a box that varies on rarity obviouslly the better you play the better you get to get most money devs made it that you get forty eight items but half of them are only for premium users what has actually happened to me was getting multiple legendaries why is that bad they were all in the premiumonly section and i didnt have premium tl dr the devs ruined this game from its original version which was playable without tons of pay2win content
early access reviewtldr robocraft was once a fun game but it isnt anymoreive played this game for a long time i played it for a while before linking it to my steam account and some more since for a long time it was an awesome game with awesome features and a great overall concept the dev team obviously cared about their players at some point within the last two years or so that changed robocraft is now a bloated unbalanced paytowin mess the devs spat in the faces of veteran players by removing many of the features that the players had relied on tech tree and tiering system and replacing them with confusing overhauls tailored to their new paradigm i attempted to live with the changes i revamped my old robots to fit the new changes but that didnt really change anything the players who had been playing under the new system longer simply had the advantage of betterinvested resources i couldnt go back and invest the resources i had already spent on things that are useful now that werent before the changes put veteran players at a disadvantage have produced awful gameplay i cant recommend this game even for free
this is why steam needs a neutral review option the game was at one point my mmo of choice but overtime it faded making bad decision after bad decision after bad decision i still look back fondly at my times in this game and the only reason i have three hundred hours is leaving the launcher open on accident in reality i have what may be thousands of hours in this game and can tell you that if you want an mmo world were there is a great amount of lore then try it if you want difficulty then look up project nineteen ninetynines which is based off of everquest one a much better game it will always have a special place in my heart but its more like a bad romance where i have to leave it but cant help and remember he good times
"ive read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguning because they look similar because both characters have red headed swordsman female elf archers and purplehaired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other but where the difference ends story the story is that a stone called the el were stolen by bandits and its up to the el search party to get it back the story moves on to each village to move the story the el stone story ends at altera when you finish the quest tunring everything back to normal then story goes to feita with an demon invasion the story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or naruto 97510characters there are currently nine characters on both versions what suprises me about them are that thirty nine characters included demons chung ara haan and elesis the character are elsword rena aisha raven eve cung ara haan elesis and the insane add i like add the most because of his backstory gameplay and personality reminds me of lasercorm from smosh games i feel mad for raven chung ara and add raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who u can fight in the first dungeon in altera chungs dad got possesed and almost died from severe injuries ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon final boss of hamel and add family got killed not by demons sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation the backstories suprises me with any way thank u south korea 98010gameplay by comboing your enimies to oblivion through specialactives skills when u reach level fifteen youll be able to choose multiple paths three for elsword rena aisha raven eve and chung two for ara and elesis and currently one for add at the time you will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend two hundred kching and youll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the second job at level thirty five either quest line or pay four hundred kching youre pick what i really love about elsword is he final dungeons the final dungeons supply you exp for you to level up and a challengin boss theres a dungeon called henirs time and space which actually a boss rush mode ive seen videos of player beating it with theyre best time there are also secret dungeons when u get to the level cap seventy however there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields when all of the stamina runs you cant dungeon untill three thirty a m 9510pvp the match making is absolutley broken my level fortytwo elsword is set with a max level elesis you start playing pvp at level ten its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later 00110community the only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms 78910cash shop i cant get enough with the cash shop costumes check quick slot extensions check pet adn mounts check inventory expansion check 1010final verdict i love this gams with a passion i have over five hundred hours in to this game and my highest level is a add combo monsters to oblivion the gamplay is good pvp is below average the stamina can get annoying but who cares ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ten"

ah yes one of valves inhouse gems team fortress two is a timeless classic that i would call similar to a fine wine it only gets better with age with the community still going strong and always new content its no surprise that with its goofy art style and genre defining gameplay that team fortress two has been going strong for eleven years heres to eleven more
fairly good game that can pass the time quite nicely however its a shame about all the dlc to get the extras but overall a fairly good game if you would like to study the inner workings of guns
early access reviewthe launcher has a bitcoin miner inbedded in it and it tracks your ip so dont get this ing brdevs are brget rid of it by searching how to remove a gaijen agent
from what i understand the freetoplay portion of the game has become more expansive with a rotating roster for free locations and licenses i personally pay for the game bought a starter pack to get a few months of unlimited licenses unlimited ammo and a bunch of permanent weapons i have really enjoyed it i even added on a few months more and enough virtual currency for an additional firearm i was curious about i havent been counting but my guess is ive paid around fifty or so and already have about one hundred hours of gameplay not to mention i have multiple months left on my current subscription with the experience this game gives you i feel like that is money well spent not the biggest bangforbuck womp womp but definitely worth it no its not going to provide the consistant action of doom or serious sam you spend time tracking luring and stalking animals that respond to the scent with wind auditory and visual cues that you provide can you spend three hours tracking a bear that you never see because it can hear you before you pick up on its tracks yes can you spend two hours luring turkeys before you find one that fits your mission objective yes are there missions where youre supposed to just spot some tracks you betcha is it worth it i think so ive never been out hunting in the real world so i cannot attest to the accuracy but i do enjoy the experience this game provides as well as the patience it teaches me
early access reviewthe exact sort of game i was hoping hearthstone would be as my play time indicates im somewhat into this game and it doesnt even include mobile timewhile it doesnt have as much depthinteraction as magic as if any game even comes close the mechanics it chose to remove ended up being a very smart move for a digital game removing the excessive places to cast spells makes this game play so smoothly and the mechanics of this game finally embrace the digital platform in ways other games failed graveyard mechanics cards that remember their buffs even when put back in the deck not having to reveal your entire hand when your opponent is looking for only units to discard with a very generous reward system in place this game is very worth trying out you just gotta survive the overlylong tutorial
its a nice game but the controls if you play with a mouse is a buggy nightmare plus theres a lot of complints about the corrupt saved files you want to play this game install bluestacks and play it at its full potential without those problems steam version is garbage
i really wanted to like this game and i enjoyed a number of elements to it but there is a lot of inconsistency between within content combat for example is good not great on quests in the wasteland but is an absolute dumpster fire in your base any time anything attacks your shelter it is just such a nuisance and it happens a lot i love the fallout franchise and art style but for me this game ended up as a hard pass
early access reviewi do recommand this game it is alot of fun i have played aqw adventure quest worlds for more then five years i loved that game it was five thousand and ten now this game i give two thousand and ten because it didnt have all the stuff that aqw did if this game aq3d gets exacly like aqw just that it is 3d then i think this game could be one of the most famous games of all time but of course it is still in ea early access so it isnt done yet but i think it never will if it becomes like aqw there is some stuff that has to be better tho sometimes i get out of the map if i walk against the wall or up a hill but only sometimes now very often tho but u got to be careful however the game is super fun it is kinda boring at the start of the game because i didnt understand much what to do and stuff but now i have played this for like twenty h and im lvl eight it took a long time for me to understand what i could do to lvl up faster and where to go to get better weapons than the ones i got from the story mode so dont do the same mistake and the graphics is good for a rpg game it is supposed to look like this and i have set my settings to highest and i got thirty fps all the time almost all the time i get forty fps sometimes but not very often so if u like rpg games and u loved aqw then u should try this out it is alot of fun but there isnt many classes yet only four as far i know warrior mage rogue and guardian but i strongly recommand this game and btw playing this with friends is one million times better thirty three
amazing addition to the btd games its even better than the mobile and flash version i think that they may have made it to op with the weekly competition i have every tower and bloon decal and i have been playing for like four weeks the competition is a very easy way to get medalions
early access reviewthis game was awesome when it came out i mean its just another br game but it was refreshing something that wasnt pubg or fortnight they went and took out classes made chickens faster than usain bolt and took away duos would not recommend fix your game
good game very much like minecraft with better graphics you dont need a great computer to play on highultra settings the only downfall is it gets pretty boring playing alone or once youve established a base with friends and like all free to play games you have to pay for things to spice up the game but the game is still very playable without spending money
this is one of the best games i have ever played if you love time cosuming games that are methodical this is for you if you like games with goals this is for you if you like resource management games this is for you it takes a lot of time i mean a lot there are soooooooo many achievements some hidden some not to get and each new run of the game is different i love idle games and this is probably the best one out there especially for the price its free try it out nothing to lose
early access reviewstarted off as a great game then the patches cames this patches the game breaking patches that destroyed what made the game great and popular now its mostly dead
early access reviewonly recently got a pc that could run games decently without overheating like a mother i was in the market for a good fps with decent gameplay now i know tf2 is out but i wanted something a bit more like cod which i found with this game to say its a f2p game its amazingly good nothing like i expected connection seems to be stable for the most part the modes are all very enjoyable more so when we figured out we had to shoot the objective not stand next to them like in cod cod noob and the guns are fairly well balanced i might only have two hours on record but i can normally get a feel on whether or not ill enjoy a game within forty minutes glad to say i most certainly feel that way about this give it a go you might as well since its free and honestly its a better fps game than the recent full price ones
warthunder is a great game and the potential it has i amazing i mainly play the non steam version one thousand hours unfortunatly the developers are absolutly terrible and some of the greediest people ive ever seen all they ever try and do is make the game less playable unless you buy premium vehicles currencey account time etc their work has continuously gotten worse over the years see the current state of naval forces helicopter damage models and the same gameplay in air rb since the game was released then when the community complains about the way the devs are acting they openly mock and censor us dont even download the game unless the developers change how they are acting
early access reviewold adventure quest worlds on the internet one thousand and ten but this game no effort at all i can see what they were trying to create but this is pure trash go play runescape or something other than this
early access reviewone of the best ccgs online atm good dose of strategy and metas a good start if you are coming from something like mtg game is very generous with card packs in the beginning and relatively easy to build a decent collection highly recommend
early access reviewwell in short the game is pretty meh it has some cool ideas but messes it up by not having good fundamentals they increased the variance which was already the main drawback of games like magic the gathering to such an extent that most games are simply decided by rngtopdecking some cards are also kinda like that that they can win the game in a turn if the opponent doesnt have the exact right answer at that one turn being mana flooded for a few turns is pretty common its almost impossible to avoid with a decksize of seventy five statistically speakingso yeah all these factors lead me to believe that the creaters fundamentally dont understand the basic mechanics and more importantly mathematics of card games or they jsut wanted to make an ultra casual mtg clone which is hard since mtg is alredy pretty casual in some ways
early access reviewjust played my first game already very cool and nostalgic gameplay from old cod games this game already has content that took rival royale games a year at least to implement i hope to see good updates and a good player base for this game would highly recommend
early access reviewsolid game though i would recommend staying away from ranked matches as they can match you against players with lag so bad they teleport stick to games with friends for maximum enjoyment
this game is really fun to play with friends i am not a fan of some of the female designs in it but with most the skins later fix the issues they make it easy to earn gems and honor to get new heroes and the class and playstyle are expansive i used to play league and this game seems to lack a lot of the toxicity thus far in players i have yet to run across the chat spamming you see in ow and league
early access review1 this game is weird you stand if front of a guy with machine gun you hit him like fifteen times than he shoots you once and youre dead2 view is a bit odd too far and swings like a drunk guy3 you open a door or window but it want to open in your direction so it cant its so ed that it makes you want to quit uninstal xd four typical experience you run for fifteen min equip everything see no one than you are dead you see no one what killed you five it laggsit has potential it could be good if those things are fixed changed
this game is pretty fun there are moments where youre part of this huge battle involving hundreds of people where there are airships mechs tanks all just trying to take a small point on a huge map then there are moments where you and a small squad of friends or people go in sneaky beaky like and take a point from under their noses my only qualms are that lvling and unlocking things can be a bit of a grind but thats about it theres always something going on and you can just air drop in the middle of the action so you dont have to drive a half hour to get somewhere unless you want to because that can be pretty fun too all in all this is pretty fun nine hundred and ten would drive around again
early access reviewthis game is awesome i love everything about plays far better than pubg and its free and no microtransactions like fortnite theres no reason you shouldnt give this game a try
really good f2p game the only thing you can buy here are skins takes skill to play oh look are good it runs on my potato intel hd graphics 4000a lot of esport events you can joinoverall i recommend it if you like fighting games c
early access reviewthey apparently removed it but eternal had spyware called red shell on it that tracks your activities outside the game i would not trust them its likely theyll integrate it back in because they were very defensive about using it
all the negative reviews have like no time on this game lol my time isnt impressive but thats because i played on mobile for a while they say this is pay2win thats complete bs you just have to know the games towers and figuring out good combos people say theres so many hackers yet i have played three hundred games without a single hacker so what gives why do people say this because there mad they lost fair and square
graphicly advanced minecraft its amazing tho i have always those moments where the game freezes for like half a second and it gets annoying like twelve times per minuteno creatorcreative mode daheck at least let the player on own serverworld do whatever they want update seems there is creativemode but only through the 20bucks dlc pack update twenty no creative mode in dlc sry xd
early access reviewi had such high hopes for this game but these developers are utterly incompetent greedy s that dont care about your gaming experience i dont think ive ever witnessed them fix anything in this game rather any issue persists as long as it takes for them to completely replace it with something else usually worse really ive tried i cant think of any the building aspect was amazing when i started playing about two years ago it actually mattered where you put your blocks and how well you protected your pilot seat the ability to actually engineer a robot is now virtually nonexistent without any kind of pilot seatcontrol module gameplay used to be a competitive and rewarding teamplay experience now that you get autoheals and autolock missiles theres no incentive for anyone to protect heal or support anyone else theyve nerfed any competetive aspect over and over to the point where pretty much whoever arrives or fires first will probably win if youre down a teammate which happens a looot as there is no way to reconnect to a match you pretty much have no control over how screwed you are itd make your head hurt trying to understand all the ways theyve accidentally succeeded in disallowing me to play with my brothers alienating their users and going against their own core concepts i really dont know how to condense the book that i can write about all the good and bad in this game but as the good seems to be gone and the bad is now worse ill just highlight a couple things that have either amused or ticked me off over the years there was a rectifier that would pulse energy to flip you over if you ended up on your back it was pretty cool this was taken away and we were given a ten second autoflip that lifts you up into the air and surrounds you in a swirly light thats like a billboard for the enemy team instead of knowing my own robot for how i built it and using my rectifiers as a tool i now avoid ending up on my back only because of this new punishment theyve forced on all of us or just let it go as a death if i do this was maybe one of my favorite items in game but im sure simple players were complaining about them being shot off duh protect them or not working correcly after your robot is half destroyed duh place them better this is a prime example of how they cater to the lowest common denomination of lazy unskilled players and then needlessly take from the rest of us to keep things in line with their idea of fair at one point they implemented multiple servers to be able to handle more users but rather than letting each one handle users as it filled up they simply divided up all the players equally amongst the servers guess what each server was starved for users and queue times instantly went up from only a few seconds to regularly over a half hour to an hour just to play a single match this persisted for the better part of a year meanwhile they seemed entirely clueless or unwilling to fix what they caused while regurgitating over and over that they just needed more players then as it was finally getting better they did it again it just goes to show whether they understood their mistake or not they dont care what you have to go through seriously from just a couple of seconds it was incredible to over thirty minutes on average for over a year and they did nothing there is this beep that lets you know when a platoon member is ready to battle it seemed to work until after a patch then once the beep started it didnt stop it was useful at first but then just frustrating and they never fixed it each garage got a x2 bonus for the first win of the day they moved the x2 to the garage icon and to the outer edge of the garage floor but it also never went away it was useful at first but then just frustrating and they never fixed it yet more issues that persisted for a year or so before just being removed entirely yep thats right no x2 bonus anymore because linking a graphic to a script was waaay to big of a job for them to handle and wouldnt directly make them any money this game has made me want to swear off early access games but given that freejam expects you will pay two thousand and forty for one crappy robot and then shows no concern for any issues you might have i really think its just the people working on it that are the problem i cant be mad at robocraft it used to be amazing but the developers have ruined it to a point that i find unplayable im more sad for the game like when you see a smart kid unable to shine under an obliviously ignorant parent their vision seems to have gone from building an awesome game that nobody else hase to blatantly copying other games in the hopes it will magically make them money i mean loot crates seriously it might not be so bad if they hadnt also at the same time taken away the ingame currency that i paid for but its still pretty bad because i have no need for anything the crates give me screw you jerks i want my money backoh and megabots im so you have no idea how many hours ive spent building my mega and now theyre just gone im really looking forward to hearing your reason for this one freejam because all the problems you remove rather than fix always seem to be your own fault in the first place these guys obviously cant manage their own code but im pretty confident that they cant write it either and that they are paying someone else to do it so we pay them to pay themselves to pay someone else to do their work and that someone else for sure cares less about us players than freejam does to be completely fair every time they take something away from me pretty much every patch i try to look at it like a whole new game so then the game isnt as great as it was but is still a pretty good game in itself at that point then its just good then just okay then disappointing then more disappointing now its just bad
early access reviewthis has installed some bs on my computer that even after uninstalling is still running id go as far as say it might be maleware stay clear of this pubg rip off
early access reviewbrawlhalla is a great game i have been playing on and off since release and i have loved every minute of it there is such a depth and a variety of mechanics and strategy that make a fighting game so exciting that i cant put it down for more than a week with constant updates from the bmg team and an incredibly active community i can safely say that this is the most fun and diverse fighting game out there gamemodes include ffa brawl four players a rotating custom game of some sort and ranked both 1v1 and 2v2 there is also a training feature and an option to make a custom room for you and your friends each of the thirty four characters feel so unique be it the different equippable weapon combinations or the six unique signature moves each legend posesses i gaurantee youll find a hero that suits your playstyle among many others youve got a cowgirl a gangster think 50s mafia and a straight up dragon the lore is somewhat whimsical yet very detailed and the community is generally friendly and willing to give tips if you ask this game is still in open access and is entirely free to play the only thing you need real money to purchase are skins and taunts neither of which have any impact on the gameplay occasionally a new weapon or mechanic will be introduced and some members of the community will take it upon themselves to and moan about how unfair the new weapon is or how the new mechanic dash being the latest is going to ruin the game forever1 however whether youre a fighting game veteran or totally new to the scene youll definitely find hours of enjoyment in brawlhalla tldr deep varied mechhanicssmooth controlsreliable serversconstantly updated active communitylots of characters to choose fromlearning curve
i came no pun intended í â íœê í â for the plot and i am staying for the upgradesi have spent many an hour playing this game some might say to many in fact i just gave it up a few months ago after finally tiring the gameplay time well spent
game has its pros and cons for me its good i play it with friends mostly really addicting the only moba which made me to stay and play it recommendation to everyone who want to play
early access reviewthis game is awesome if you are reading reviews to see if you should play you should i bought gems just to say thanks to the devs great gameplay generous ftp model very fun
early access reviewgood game its just a huge time waster when it comes to getting coins u have to do some hardcore grinding to get anything done i would like it a lot if either they lowerd the prices on legends or u earned more coin when finishing a match
early access reviewvery bad dont like the game after i deleted it it keeps opening the game by itself when im using my computer even though i uninstalled the game please just stop opening fix this at once
очень рад что ее смогли портануть под windows слава богу в игре нет арты достаточно быстрые бои симпотичный графон как по мне удобное управление страно что тут много не хороших отзывов про эту игру рекомендую лично опробывать ее так как каждому свое на вкус и цвет
fun when you first play it gets to be an insufferable grind later on not so much fun as it was when i started playing it more fun with friends play with a ww2 documentary on the side and learn all there is to learn about adolf the boys510 used to be eight hundred and ten
pro one of the best cards gameeasy to use and really good if its your first card gameif you liked skyrim you will feel at home playing this gamethe story and the way they made the cinematics is really coolgood online play pretty balancedlots of good things you should at least try it considering that its freecons then it seems im wrong and you dont have to pay to fully play the game i just didnt paid enough attention to it as it seems conclusion try it
early access reviewi really enjoy the game but it would be nice if there was a type of training mode where you could test out different classes and abilities otherwise its a great game and i think that it will only grow and improve from here on out
early access reviewruns better than pubghas better graphics than pubgfunniest battle royale game on the marketf2pconstant updatesjumping bootsbroken mg42s1010 download without hesitation
"not a very good sim the venerable old fsx is of far higher quality than this is im a former aircraft mechanic and veteran who worked on some of these planes i know pretty much everything about them so yes i know exactly what im talking about as an expert in the field furthermore the company behind this game often engages in unethical business practices raising and lowering prices in an attempt to make more money off each sale by making the sales appear bigger than they actually are for example an aircraft that has been listed for years at a nine hundred and ninety nine price has been jacked up to one thousand, four hundred and ninety nine on this and previous summer or winter sales only to return to the normal price a month or two after the sale ends other games by other russian developers have also engaged in this tactic i do not mind supporting developers but for them to engage in unethical behavior in order to siphon money from the player base is wrong also they use the controversial starforce spyware on all of their dlc this has been known to damage computer systems in the past i have two damaged dvd drives as proof that were killed by starforce that was on the cycling manger three game all those years ago but not only is it very intrusive software but it is also spyware something that i didnt think t hat valve would ever allow on steam game is not recommended due to its lack of realism unsavory business practices by the developer and inclusion of spyware in dlc content"
i love how this game assumes i havent been playing yugioh since two thousand and two its fun i mean its duel monsters ffs i just with there was an option to skip the godforsaken tutorial i just want to duel not sit here for an hour to pretend to learn the ropes of a game i mastered over a decade ago i downloaded this because nobody near me plays
early access reviewcould be that im just bad at the game but its not fun for me as a new player the grind feels worse than path of exile which is inherently not a bad thing ranked system needs too be looked at and the rewards
early access reviewthis games provides a very good battle royale experience and you can choose between classes and various spells i will surely recommend this game the movement mechanics are just crisp and the time i played this game it was worth every second truly enjoyable and nice experience
i truly wanted to like this game and invested time and money to purchase the car and track bundles the game is fun when the servers are working and you dont get hit with the dreaded five hundred and three server error that keeps you from logging in to play whats worse is if you purchased any of the dtm or adac experience addons only to find out they are also unavailable when the server is out i suggest looking into assetto corsa project cars or even iracing considering its designed online only and much more consistent in providing a fulfilling experience thread carefuly
i can only recommend this if you enjoy facing the same decks over and over again all you really see people run is cyber angels ancient gears tea burnmill weevil burnmill redeyes zombies or the occasional grandpas cards tomfoolery it is dull repetitive and a waste of time this went from a legitimately decent yugioh game to a cesspool of cashgrabbing because any new players better invest money into this game if you want to even have a chance in pvp there are better yugioh games stay away from this one
one of the most idiotic card systems in steam enemy random always hits a warded creaturedraw dependantloose one hundred times to lv up game just frustrating as hellwas hoping for more strategy involved game instead you get buy a in bundle and try winning again but even that wont guarantee you a victorycuz enemy got of low cost card with high powers and just owning you from right to left and btw since enemy cards are closed you can really see that its not so random as it should be and thats only a first god dam campaign pathetic
the game itself is awesome the grafic is good the animals behave like animals and even the weather is nicley done the gameplay is good and all such stuff i would love to recommend it but as freeplayer you can only run across the map and watch you are only allowed to shot two species and they are so rare that you will almost never find em you cant host your own games so that you can hunt with a friend and if you join some random game nobody can gurantee that you are welcome
early access reviewthe games addicting thats legit the only thing you need to know if you are going to play this game expect to get a bit addicted its hard not to enjoy this game not be excited to see new features or ships or practically anything because your mind is constantly captivated to what can be done with the game for alpha nice i read a couple of reviews before i decided to write one but i did notice someone mentioning they couldnt join servers they were not given a reason why dont join almost full servers join a empty one itll fill up easily
everyone of yall dislike the sht out that mf trove gameall i said i sucked dik for hobby and mfs in the game makin a fool outa me yo it aint gay suckin dik even says in the bible suck thy dik man i miss back in prison yall we used to share each othas as know wa mean i aint gay but i would suck a nigas dik if yall keep talkin to me like that promis u dawg yall gonna get your dik suckedimma put it in the bowl o salad and toss it around and suck that dik look yall can call me gay much as yall want but yall know ya gon get yo as beat and toes sucked cuz i dont play dat sht if i aint gay i aint gay
early access reviewa lot of fun and very addictive not been playing very long but is very easy to get sucked in i was at first leary about the grapics as it is very mine craft type but the map is huge and the possibilies are endless and i find more and more neat things every day bought pro already addictive
was so hyped for this game after seeing the reveal cinematic i honestly thought that it was going to be a free to play final fantasy online clone what i got was a twenty worth of ing disappointment
product received for freeearly access reviewused to have progression and you would need to grind but you earned items now its system is black ops three and is more confusing and stupid instead of weapons and things having levels they have names and you need to check each individual item if its the better or worse version and i spent hours upon hours grinding to get heavily armoured cubes and somewhat good weapons well the game threw me the finger and i dont think theyre switching it back and even if they do i dont think my armoured cubes will come back as far as i can tell this game is now trash and until further updates this game is trash
things i gave amount of brawlhalla gave meautism32 different types of lung cancera shemale that i did not ing wantdopameme who i also did not and still do not want
early access review1 download the game2 install the game3 run the game four got a hngsync error5 fix it six got a under maintance error7 play it tomorrow8 got an gngsync error again9 fix it with another tips10 got an same ing error dont play this game bacuse the dev wont to solve the problem
early access reviewthis is a very pretty game but i cannot in good faith recommend it there are a lot of crafting options things flow more or less understandably with the recipes being unlocked as you build things not a huge fan of that but it helps you understand the game so im alright with it visually its very nice but the problem is the combat system monsters have a much larger range than you and there are no effective ranged weapons so i was forced to dash through enemies there is no collision damage the one small mercy here while swinging and hoping i hit didnt always because sometimes i would inexplicably fail to swing my sword for several seconds and then swipe at empty air and with limited stamina every battle against an enemy that actually fights back and all but three or four of them do is a dice roll whether youll be able to win before your dash meter bottoms out and youre murderized by a tiny evil piglet theres no other tactic that seems to work even circle strafing as mobs seem to be able to hit you from any angle and any elevation theyre easily able to follow wherever you go unless you outpace them or have a door to shut in their face and some are small enough to slip through 1x1 gaps and terrorize you theres a severe disparity between monster health and damage output for the early game im not sure how it is in late game because i gave up after progressing to the obsidian tier and that was enough of a problem as it was requiring the consultation of a wiki to find the best places and ways to kill things and not die repeatedly its a shame the combat is so awful because the rest of the game is really quite welldone there are ladders with autosnap teleporters really nicelooking decorations you keep everything in your action bar when you die just not your inventory the crafting system isnt gridbased so it doesnt feel like a direct rip of minecraft all these are nice things but ultimately in order to progress beyond the very basic levels of interaction with the world you have to kill things and thats where the game fails and fails terribly i wanted to like this i really did but im not going to suffer through this horrible combat system any longer
i got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money and i have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase over fortysix hundreds hours over a span of five years ive played this game and watched it grow add new things i was there from the hatless update april fourteen twenty elevens up to the twenty sixteens smissmas update the game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decissions i wasnt very fond of if its something valve are masters on it is to build a game thats all about the gameplay its by their flawless designs that their games like left four dead counterstrike and team fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day despite some of them being decades old looking at team fortress two it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games especially when twenty sixteens saw a surge of other classbased arena shooters like overwatch and battleborne haha i will say i played overwatch for about a year it was the christmas of twenty sixteens when i first got overwatch and at the start i enjoyed it but over the year i played it the sessions when i played it grew further and further appart until i only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didnt touch the game it was then i really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game how it had been polished to perfection something as simple as the loadouts simple change of weapons could completely alter the playstyle of characters in this game swap the engineers wrench out for a gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the offensive rather than defensive the medics main weapon syringe gun vs blutsauger changes whether hes a battle medic or not the syringegun allows you a passive health regen of 4hp but blutsauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regen by three points making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regen after escaping close encounters thats only two examples of ways classes can change depending on their loadout every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their loadout in games like overwatch your hero has counters meaning you cant master a class to the point where youre unbeatable because hes been designed around a rockpaperscissors design to where some hero can take you out in this game it was just about picking a class selecting a loadout that suits your playstyle and going to town there was very little counters each class could take out the other equaly so long as you played it right with one class exception the community also helped make this game great by offering custom game modes custom maps custom servers it was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it allowed the community to create and take part in it something overwatch doesnt allow past letting them design skins what has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that i feel it has lost its way many of the people i used to play with have moved on and the community isnt the same as it once was the community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are minecraft servers with ads out the as to try and cash in ad revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favorite game thats not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community the dev team has plenty to do in it as well trying to make the weapons balanced the team went back and fourth with alot of the weapons in the game improving some that were before worthless like the quick fix and but turning some before good weapons bad the problem is that when listening to a community you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt keep in mind its not the people using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced its the people getting killed by them thats complaining much like how cod nerfed its shotguns down to being useless the game killed alot of good weapons and ruined some peoples loadout but it wasnt also loadout changes adding things like competitive play to the game i still feel was one of the worst decissions ever the games random crits system is there for a reason its there as a boost of luck so that even if youre better than everyone else you might have a critical rocket strike you or a critical heavy or scout which you wouldve otherwise escaped from or defeated could you imagine if cs go had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg itd count as a crit and kill the person the community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and instakill the person they were shooting at i no longer play team fortress two because the state its in is not one i like i have played it a bit in recent times but that was doing tour of duty with some friends as mann vs machine is a gamemode i still enjoy but even if i no longer play it i will never forget the friends i made through it i wont forget the trading i did through it i wont forget the fun times i had on it fortysix hundreds hours amounting to more than half a year some would call that a waste but i wouldnt have traded those hours for anything thank you for the memories team fortress two
early access reviewwas ruined when they screwed around with tiers no idea what it is now but i can tell from all the loot box crap that the devs probably arent fixing things and simply are sugar coating the game i mean its free to play so give it a shot but from coming from alpha to now the game has certainly gone down hill due to that i cant recomend this but try if you must
two thousand and seventeen greats games but to much cashshop needed for get great statsstupid system of stamina never removed its that reason they have only 500player ingamenow you can create twelve characcount but four by day greats choice classeif you are poverty like me you really will not like to play because of the shopbut i dislike again this game only because the stamina system2014 if you dont like pvp dont play after have not stamina you can only play in pvp cant create only 3characcount4h or 5hours by day before out of stamia pvp unbalanced and its game its pay to win
feels and plays like an old game combat feels weird and autopath is even weirder performances are pretty bad even on high end machines game map is huge but the world feels so empty and dull cant believe people really paid to enter ea and beta test this game plenty of better mmorpg out there this is below average at best
i highly recommend this game for its high quality graphics and incredible gameplay its storyline was so strong that even after twenty minutes i was on the ground crying88 i would r8 m8
updated as of twenty five november everything below still stands true and is still an excellent game id like to spend a few moments on explaining the business model of this free to play title tldr the business model of this free to play is solid you can aquire anything noncosmetic in the game by playing it but by spending a few bucks you can increase the rate at which you can aquire the things you wantfirst of id like to say that you can access all noncosmetic items in the game without spending any real world currency by simply playing the game as you are playing the game you get xp from doing pretty much anything relevant in the game and for every 250xp you aquire one certification point these certs are the primary currency in the game which you will spend on anything that interest you except cosmetics that can only be bought with real money however we are now going to look at the things in the business model that are impefect compared to a completely fair free to play titlewhile a lot of the upgrades and things that impact your gameplay are only possible to aquire through certs certain things can be alternatively bought by spending real money such as weapons weapon scopes and possibly the soon to be implemented implants also you can purchase experience boosters using only real money that will for a limited time increase the amount of experience you gain while playing the game lastly there is the ability to pay a monthly subscription to the game similar to conventional mmo titles and this will cause you to recieve an experience boost as well among other things that been said the starting equipment is all competetive even in some cases regarded by many to be the best in slot for the experienced players as well
yeah so fallout shelter when it came out on mobiles i played it i played it so frigging much addicting as hell to have the most perfect vault ever although my samsung galaxy s5 handled the game well once you had a big vault and all that the game got laggy and also strained your phone i uninstalled it right away once i heard about the pc version no more phones heating like a cooking pot no more laggy playing with big vaults i always knew somehow this game ended up on steam and i waited for the steam version until i started playing again so what it is the most fun and simple building simulator and the best part is the fallout theme it has a lot of content but you will grind like hell micromanage and wait i mostly do some stuff on my pc like editing photos and such this game runs on the background and keeps going automatically until something needs to be done mr handy 3best part of the new features are the wasteland quests and exploring some buildings in wasteland its fun for first thirty five weeks but you can get bored overall this game is propably one of the best mobile games ever created you can do just fine without paying for the starter packages and all that but who cares i threw five euros for the starter package not a big deal a must play for any fallout fan
product received for freeearly access reviewi recommend it free to play pubg right here boys but today when i launched every single time it kicks me out of the game or the game crashes but i get sloid one hundred fps on standard standard and realistic i dont know is it to my pc or the game it freezes me when i choose the place wherei want to spawn help if you know the solution
early access reviewgot this game during a free weekend i must say i am very happy of course it was free despite getting it free i believe that this game is worth the ten dollar price point despite it being early access the alpha build shows itself but the gameplay thus far is solid and fun you can unlock more ships as you go by achieving kills wins and captures you do not have to buy anything in game from the looks of things in the store its skins and five experience boost and i think there is one premium ship that can be bought but i dont know if you have to later unlock it
amazing dthis game is scary in a way that will make you laugh it yourself try to just when the music changes most of the time its better not to look back to see waht youre running from then suddenly gets spooked by a cute cardboard ghost no spoilers check the game yourself its free and you can basically run it on anything even a potato which make me think the recommanded specs was a prank its self
early access reviewstarted out liking this game the more you play the more you understand that the game is very shallow all these ranked decks are similiar lets all play the same cards oh look another stranger deck lame too add to that its a very dumbed down version of magic the gathering or should i say a replica of hearthstone
could not make the interface work i could not find the proper aspect ratio this sim has a long way to go to compete with other nice flight sims like falcon bms and others and starting in the frog foot is not where i would start just sayin
a decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small rather hostile playerbase with limited variety good gameplay overall is really good the ships are slow and require some patience they are supposed to be big hulking capital ships the combat is pretty good as well bad variety two modes conquest and frontline conquest has two lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes frontline is basically the same thing but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic so you have two modes that both have the samesimilar mechanics and objectives if you dont like one mode you wont like the other ships stealth some ships have stealth which in and of itself isnt a bad thing the problem is that they drag the game down and are just unfun to play against games like dota2 do stealth right where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves which this game has but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes which this game doesnt have so if the enemy team drafts a team you cant switch ships mid match and you cant see what the enemy is bringing and you dont have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill you are sol double or tripple the frustration when compared to dota2 because you also have a three dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be its just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you cant see the enemys draft but no option to counter if you dont draft one of those few counter ships yourself sound game audio is mediocre ship fire sounds rather lackluster playerbase its no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players the problem is that in the few recent pvp matches ive played people are rather hostile that might not be an issue if the game had a decent playerbase but if you run into someone you dont like be prepared to see them in the next twenty matches because odds are youll fight them again and again beyond that finding a match for me has taken everything between one minute and ten grind unlocking ships doesnt seem so bad but i also bought into the games early access and so had a lot of credits stored up however ships range between 300k credits and 1mil credits while you earn about 1015k each match it just feels like too much of a grind for me and thats before you buy the sidegrades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have menu omg i hate the menu system in here such a pain to visit the hanger and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it there are some filters but they dont help as much as youd think overall the menues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming overall the gameplay is good but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions
early access reviewoh my goober ive played the aq games since i was youger and i loved em to bits now tp have a 3d game that i can play on my phone thats amazing get this game now
early access reviewif you casually enjoy being spawnkilled and put in unfair positions your team simply cannot win then this sirmadam this the game for you welcome to pay two win online edit one march fifth two thousand and sixteen game is still a massive pos with absoltely no balance edit two march twelve two thousand and sixteen sniper rifles are practically instant kill also rearming costs for ammunition is absolutely ridiculously and inhibits any form of progression edit three skyheart is a massive scrub this is for you buddy
early access reviewan excellent mix of hearthstone and mtg if you getting tired of hearthstones randomness or want something similar to mtg without the insane cost definitely check out eternal the f2p rewards are very generous
game is still buggy and unoptimized constant framerate drops when playing on normal settings go play minecraft atleast you can choose which version you want and mod it out to your liking
early access reviewone of my favorite games hands down the developers particularly are really excellent and do not try and nickel and dime their players into some pay two win scheme i appreciated that so much i actually did end up purchasing packs even still before then i had a good number of cards from playing and did not feel overly restricted matchmaking is very quick and the multiple modes and events keep it interesting
i know how many hours i have on steam curently but ignore it because i have been playing scense opne beta and i have quite some experience with this game and i can proudly say that i recomend it not even joking i allready have about twenty skins just by not paying a cent beacuse im a casual scrub and its awesome
there are alot to say about dota defenders of the ancients its a remake of the old dota mod for warcraft actually i could say that the transition from dotadota two gameplay was amazingthey didnt forgot a single thing and added even more than original dota the game got amazingly cool graphics and a great soundtrack the menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players valve really cares about your learning in dota2 so theyve made a learning page where they teach you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items dota two have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each herobecause dota one didnt had that optionso you need to now by your experience what to buy they have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does if you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more professional player to teach you its called coachhe will spectate your game and make you tips the gameplay is amazingi love it because its very realistic and logic dota two got a lot of logicinstead mobas like lol dont have the art of heroes are sorry but ill repeat itare amazingeverything is amazing in dota almost xdstill dota got some problems that need to be corrected 1stthe community dota two community is full of stupid noobish kidswho dont know how to play and dont even learn how to playand when you say them dont feed or other itemtheyll always say to you fuc younoobive fuc your mothertypical answer of russian twelve y o kids2some updates that dont needed to be done like removing the pudge fountain hookbecause it had a lot of logic and they removed it but nevermind to this3i cant tell you if dota2 still got many bugs or notbut i notice that they still have a fewlike shop bug where you cant buy items4servers i dont know why but its normal to have the servers down in dota2and sometimes in the game will appear searching for dota2 networkdont know why this happens but probably their servers cant hold so much people my opinion so yeah thats pretty what ive wrote i hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do good luck have fun
after playing this game over the course of three seasons on the smite launcher and steam version my feelings for this moba are extremely mixed considering at this point i only play once every few weeks that should indicate my lasting appeal towards smite although the game and its content such as the gods game modes and other aspects are great hirez poorly maintains and executes fixes and patches to the game hirez has trickled down from a respectable corporation to a greedy monopolizing entity that only focuses on new ways to attract new players not by improving the servers or balancing but adding additional cosmetics and other useless cash grab elements they claim as if they actually care about catering to the communities needs in terms of balancing items and gods fixing bugs and reducing crashes but the only results we are given involve a more unstable foundation and skins hell at least give skins to different gods besides the same pool of gods they seem to fancy most for instance it took years for ravana to receive a new skin which was later removed due to copyright after a few months they decide to literally recycle the skin and just change the color schemeeffects and vp to avoid more copyright issues im completely aware that some people are fine with the current changes and thats fine all im saying is hirez needs to step their game up and stop trying to divide their company on so many different projects which is probably one of the main issues they arent giving smite enough light of day and attention and only make light hearted pledges to redditors just to keep them calm and reduce the pressure on themselves overall id give this moba a five hundred and ten in its current conditions if hirez actually starts to fix year old bugs and balance itemsgods more fairly and effectively it could potentially reach an eight hundred and ten or better
world of tanks blitzis at its core nothing more than a grind arena shooter youre pitted against eachother in team deathmatch and capture the base modes both modes active at the same timeby doing battle you earn experience and credits with your earned rewards you upgrade your current tank or you purchase a new tank but how does it play the general gameplay is solid and didnt show any real bugs the main issue that ive got with this game is the extreme grind factor and the very clear go premium to enjoy setting dont get me wrong you dont have to go premium to enjoy the game but it sure takes away the grind or as a brii states with premium you would have to grind maybe a few hours less then without premium but still youd have to spend numerous hours and battles grindingdid i enjoy it yes i did for the first couple of rounds until i noticed that theres no real nation filter when it comes down what model of tank battles the other besides of that the first few times things are not always as clear when it comes down to what upgrade to buy or not is this a stayer not for me i like the different tank battles but itsnothing new therere better tank games out there even more tactical ones but its basically free and thats somewhat of a nice thing still i dont really see myself getting back into this game if they dont add some sort of single player coop campaign mode which they probably wont due to the fact that everything is geared towards pvp clashes
really wanted to give bless online a try for a long time but the negativity surrounding it always stopped me before i hit the install button so far i have played bless online for twentytwo hours granted not a lot to judge a mmorpg and see all that it offers but i honestly enjoyed myself most asian mmos have artstyle that turns me off immediately but bless seems like it nailed that perfectly coupled with its excellent music it really helps me immerse myself in the world its true that player count doesnt seem that great but the gameplay is very good and entertaining to me at least the combat system is drastically different than any mmorpgs ive played and its more actionoriented than most it takes a little getting used to and changing key binds to suit your style there are some inconveniences here and there like how am i constantly spammed by the game that who creates what that doesnt seem to be the slightest concern to me and i couldnt find the option to turn it off but still that didnt stop me enjoying the game yet the game looks gorgeous for a dx9 game it requires to be on ssd and even then occasionally have noticeable drops but it didnt bother me that much since every mmo i played has that from world of warcraft to elder scrolls online you have occasions that you have massive performance drops the business model seems fair too maybe i didnt look at everything but so far i couldnt see items in their shop that gives massive advantage you get to tame your mounts and pets which was a really refreshing feature to me i get it the game has flaws but im having a blast and i hope the devs and neowiz which i hear they call the graveyard of mmos dont abandon it it has great potential
"i am a sim racer since the good old c64 revs since that year i drove nearly every race sim on the market to make it short race room experience is definitely the one available its the feeling of the game no other race game has such a good force feedback and sound the ai is very good maybe other title have better graphics project cars but this one just feels great racing rre is such a great experience after a race with a good ffb wheel like csw two you are completely done its so heavy to feel the road and the opponents and hear the best racing sound on the market give it a try even with the free version you can have a lot of fun their is so many high quality content available that every race sim fan is happy my personal favorites are dtm one thousand, nine hundred and ninety two group c cars and brands hatch and salzburgring"
if youve ever played combat flight sims back in the 90s golden era as i did the dream of a fully immersive good looking and complex simulation has come true what a time to be alive
with permadeath in this game it makes it a whole lot challenging you must try to avoid dangerous shots at all times to prevent your character from dying as your character levels and progresses they will also find stronger equipment to take on stronger enemies if youre careless you will die the feature of stat pots and pets can change everything plus it is an mmorpg so that means you can work together with others to kill baddies i also like how its in sprite art and theres also tons of classes for you to play around with their unique abilities
crashed five times this morning fun for a free game and stressfull if you like your gear keep away from people if you wana live that crashing problem tho my friend crashed a couple a times to and has quit playing since go get miscreated
early access reviewthis game is fun and addicting and has great fighting systems and a great premise if you are a smash fan this is the game for you in some ways it is better than smash
ive put more time into planesetside two than all my other steam games and after this last update it just made me fed up with the game ultra long wait times for updates to come out just to see the game go down hill i kept trying to be excited for each update but then be disappointed with half baked crap and nerfs i used to love the game when i first started playing but then the updates and increasingly stale gameplay just ruined it
really fun game until you reach max level sixty then when you queue up for dungeons your gearscore is too low so the game forces you to spend money to buy better armor using real money this is a pay to win game
i am fan of fallout and decided to try fallout shelter i was pleasently suprised by how much fun it was i am now hooked and have to check it every hour or so just to see what my little dwellers are up to the only negative is that to speed things along you need nukacolas and you can need quite a lot for some things
early access reviewso i have six hours of gameplay and i was declined for refund but there is ppl with twenty hours of gameplay getting refunds they game is horrible and isnt complete absolute
well i flewall in the bluei like the skywhen you are highthere you can slackuntil you get by a yakget shot out from the fleetexitdelete real talk though some damn planes are over powered like the yak9t and the yak7 yak planes in general the spitfire has almost made me rage quit and break my eighty mouse the game needs a balance system maybe like a ranking system if i am flying a p26 and a messerschmitt comes out of no where then one taps my pilot that makes me off although the game is free it is alright but i cant recommend to anyone because of my experiences one thousand and ten would rage quit again

i hate this game for horrible renditions of us bombers that fall apart after twelve shots i hate the fact that they knowingly make russian vehicles vastly more powerful than others i hate this game for so many reasons but i cant argue with the hundreds of hours of fun i had playing it if you can put up with some serious annoyances youll have a great time
the two free aircraft that you get are very fun to fly and decent to introduce the game to you this is a combat flight simulator with a command element to give the ground units more realism i highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in aviation or flying aircraft this game does have a slightly steep learning curve but that is countered by video tutorials available at the main menu of the game i highly recommend that you visit the developers website and download a copy of the checklist for the aircraft that you wish to fly then print it out and keep it handy or download it to a tablet the graphics are not bad for a flight simulator but are not cutting edge the multiplayer is not bad but depends on the server and its mission most multiplayer missions are community developed and not all aircraft are available in every mission their is also no in game voip feature so downloading teamspeak is a must for voice communication all and all a good game but better if you pick it up during a sale
early access reviewif you think fortnite has burnt to the ground this game is for you preferably play with a group of mates because they dont do solo just yet but dont let that change your mind its free so it wont hurt its great fun and has much creative ideas in which fortnite should be taking notes update its about time streamers milk the game and bring the edgy fortnite players over giving the game enough confidence and money to milk their game its gonna happen
a game that has stood the test of time and even if valve doesnt know how the game works cough bison cough thats not a problem with the great community backing it new content being added regularly by the community for the community if you like a fps with a cartooney feel yet still excessively violent as livers to decapitated heads fall from the sky then this game is for you there are nine selective classes each with strengths and weaknesses to enforce stratigic team based combat but hey if you dont like any of that you can dive into the economey and relish in the one thousand selection of hats to deck out your merc so people think you know what your doing
if you like furriesanime13 year old girls people being covered in mudlosy fitted skirts and tops staying up until 3am playing games with the door shutlooking at people in a lot of costumesthen this is the game for you and the whole family maybe not the whole family but you catch my driftplay on a tablet to get the best weeaboo experience imaginable buy all the dlcs that come out almost everyday for only ninetynine cents wownow will you excuse me i need to restock my tissue supply have a good day playing this really weird game
it was alright for the first couple of years then the ajax came and replaced our beloved savior drybear creating the super freemium experience of loot boxes for most of the decent skins creating the super aegis and beads meta actives will be missed and smite is dead in terms of fun without friends at least at a higher level it is somewhat fun for a beginner but not really as people that played other mobas will probably pub stomp you in lower levels if the games not fun why bother reggie filsaimé
"early access reviewnot ready for soft launch the devs are rubberbanding back and forth and dont seem to have a solid grasp of whats going on despite the opportunities they have proven time and again that they fail to understand their na audience as of six thousand, eight hundred and eighteen the extended refund period seems to be over this wouldnt have affected my review but sure does impact my interest in checking the game out later do yourself a favor and wait a year or two if it continues on the current course the game will have collapsed well before then if they can get community and development staff that are nabased they might be able to get back on track but right now that appears very unlikely the bless reps in the steam forums are largely useless and dont have the answers that their customers are requesting"
every once in a while gaijin will cave in to the russiaonly crybabies who swear up and down that not a single t54 is series or t55 was ever lost in combat so then in order to please people who do nothing but impulse buy all of their russian premiums this is likely where a fair chunk of their change comes from they do crap like this they glitch out the turret armor on all their high tier soviet tanks grinding to face off against these death machines is a fun time in and of itself so that anything less than a top tier sabot round from a chieftans turbolaser of a main gun wont pen they fool around with the spalling mechanics and goof off with the crew durability i have seen soviet crew members make the ultimate sacrifice by stopping a sabot round from my japanese m41a1 and preventing it from killing the rest of the crew its absurd yes the game is beautiful and yes the models are high quality not many moving parts but ill take what i can get but this means nothing if you are only going to be seeing the same gopnik death devices speeding around the map at breakneck speeds like the thirtysomething mile an hour is6 that every goober and his grandma has shilled out for meanwhile tanks like the ru251 and the bulldog putter around at a speed that is so meh that youre just glad you arent in anything else because anything else is garaunteed to be slow as dog doo and not a match for the eastern bloc armored battalionsoviet border guards circa nineteen sixtyones that you are going to be facing off against the economy is once again in shambles tens of the exact same plane but with bigger gunswacky enginesa different paint job see p51d series focke wulfe series yakelov meteors spitfires except for the griffonpowered god flying christ machines zeroes force you to shell out big money just to progress there used to be folders that the aircraft would fit into and the research mechanic is just an excercise in how much punishment am i willing to endure today because if you dont have premium then congratulations youre gonna die the balancing is nonexistant the russiaboos and actual slavniks who are absolutely and i mean truly terrible at the game will complain about everything uhhh hesh doesnt cause ttttthhhaaaatttt much spalling its only like a single piece of metal that i can catch with my hand cause im super cool uhhhhh sloped armor can block absolutely everything so the is6 should be completely unkillable from all angles uhuhuhuhuh uhhhh the 122mm main gun is like uh the most powerful gun ever bbut i dont really wanna face off against jagdtigers and m47 pattons and fv4005s i kinda just wanna club tiger 1s and 2s and they listen to these demands and then they give into them and guess what russia mains still suck they still get crapped on by the likes of bulldogs tiger 1s baby centurians hell ive even taken several out with my trusty m42 duster shoot the lowest part of the hull from the side it has no armor and the complaining and screaming that comes with every kill is just mind numbing did the is6 get killed expect a torrent of vulgar statements ending with a paragraph did the is6 get a kill expect a smartassed response in the chat about you should get good because the is6 is such a hard tank to use and all this gripe is about one tank that like i said any goober can shell out money for this is to say nothing of the is3 and four impenetrable superfortress the tu4 meat on the table approach them from the front works every time and the t54 this thing totally saw extensive service in ww2 but what about the super high tier t64a its poo poo because such ridiculous superweapons such as the mbt70 and kpz70 exist i dont know how they managed it why buy a slow 3man t64a when you can end the match as soon as it begins in a kpz70the aircraft are a joy to fly but i feel as though another kick to the huevos is incoming so who knows it needs work and for now imma have to give is a no for this recommendation and i have several thousand hours put into this game i only recently linked up my gaijin account with my steam one for streaming purposes p s by the way the community is supportive and is willing to listen to advice and help out a friend but the few mods that actively post ingame are just gigantic trolls who start arguments spam chat and ban people for asking them to stop so just dont talk to anybody in the general chat period not like anybody does anyway theyve all been banned seriously
early access reviewnote pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indiedb and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version twelve now for the review im not really a person who could judge what is considered cute i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesnt need to follow the path to catch you so in that regard i guess you could call them scary too i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room like how they were in the indiedb version i played but outside of those enemies the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing on top of that if its your first time playing they can catch you off guard as theres no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances what i mean is that unlike other horror games good ones that is there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the rules to win against said enemies are laid out take for example the first resident evil the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing whats in the room with you following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie a youll notice you use up almost all your ammo and b that youll take damage whereas avoiding it youll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies well agile while using tank controls so evasion is a preferred option when you can thats not to say that how the enemies appear in sphj is bad in fact the opposite the fact you dont know when youll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds its own eeriness as you dont know what the next room holds for you you have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker however this brings up an issue i have with the game theres way too much luck involved ill give a good example the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out just run but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first catwalk room thats what i call it at least the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions if you just dead sprint you have a five thousand and fifty chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in three hits there are other points like this as theres an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough ive yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong or right in my case as again i havent encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs so like i said this game takes alot of luck if youre going to get far or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run the other issue i have im not sure if its an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if its just how the game happened to be made the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room what i mean is that you cant just hold down the w key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room no in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you wont move and take damage till you remember to release the forward key and press it again like i said im not sure if its intentional or not if its not then i hope the devs will work on this as its basically a cheap beginners trap but other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and cant wait to see what the full release is like

"dota two is a fps developed by bungie in nineteen ninetyeights for the nintendo sixty four its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure similarly to the best game of the year one thousand and ten new york times gone home you play a young lesbian trying to find love however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieveing your goal the obstacles are mostly stuns and supressions that every playable champ in the game has access to accept for surpressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low prio but thats another story the game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg dota two is also an amazing language software on pare with rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages including but not limited too russian mexican spanish burrito burrito taco ecceterra i would highly suggest this game to you and your friends despite it being so over priced at eight thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine msrb it is worth every penny dota two is also the only good video game to come out in the last twentyeight years and will stay that way for years to come and thats how i spent my summer vacation ferris bueller"
its a fun little game if youre into base management dont ing buy anything from it its all a ripoff cause on a free single player game paying for gameplay benefits fine what the hell its free and its single player no harm no foul except in this game you pay for the chance of getting something useful and believe me it wont be other than that its fine its fun its pretty and most importantly its free
early access reviewdamnn i really admire this game the graphic is really realistic and beautiful and the game it self is really fun and funny xd i higly recommend this game and thank you for creating this game owhh yeah it would be much better if u guys add night mode
its an okay game i like how it uses standard dd character stats i dont like how im level thirteen and still have level one pants no quest rewards no loot and not even a merchant nor do i like that im level thirteen and havent unlocked the ability to chat yet you have to complete five different quest chains in order to unlock chat which i understand is an anti spam thing but damn son thats asking entirely too much of people overall twenty five would play but not recommend
early access reviewover all the changes this game is keep getting ing harder and harder by ing the stupid partsits impossibe to go one round without ing dieing or getting lot of money do not get this game cause its a game that just makes u waste your money on stupid bundles and premium to make it easier i do not reccomend this game its another scam to waste your money
this game really frustrates me i spent hours trying to get this sht to work everytime i tried joining a server it told me disconnected from server i tried everything from opening the launcher it self to lowering everything in the settings but it still doesnt let me play it if redownloading the game doesnt work then the review is staying like this
early access reviewoverall i give a four hundred and fifty five or 910its a 2d platform fighting game no its not smash melee or four its actually sorta unique has lots of mechanics that do not exist in smash ex gravity cancelling edge sliding edge guarding is diff weapon system and chase dodging most characters are pretty unique in their own stats signature moves this game features amazing 2v2 combos lots of strings lots of combos per character lots of combos per weapon still it obviously retains the fighting getting hit out of stage sding and di 55you can also play this game offline with friends at your house or something also there is a training mode which allows you to set a bot to reset in its original spot or hp the more damaged they are the more they are knocked back back thus you have an excellent way to repeatedly practice combos alone 55you can play from a selection of ffa 1v1 experimental mode 1v1 ranked 2v2 ranked and custom games55customization each character can be bought and leveled up leveling up until twenty on a character unlocks many different color choices for that character you can purchase skins they include the outfit two weapon skins you can mix and match colors skins of your choice for each character its not entirely customizable but its good enough45
yugioh is still a fun game but konami is just as as usual while this game is free to play without either putting in ungodly hours or paying rediculous amounts of money its impossible to get past gold in pvp it uses a whatsome complex card buying system where you purchase packs out of boxes so while there maybe 10x of a common and fifty different commons while only 1x of eight ur the rarest cards in a box of two hundred packs you can only use three of any cards in a deck and most commons are useless so you could and often will as there almost always an ur in the last packs have to buy five hundred commons or two hundred packs at thirty for thirty just to get one useful card also the rng is flat out the worst i have ever used in a game as a long time yugioh i have had had bs draws in this that i simply could never get in real life its the same the over way i have had the perfect card after card and almost felt bad when playing online all that being said i dont imagine ill stop playing but also will not forget how of a company konami is and never pay for cardsbuy one of their games again if you want to play this game seriously be prepared to either fork out either tons of cash or a major grind until you have useful spelltrap cards mirror wall wall of disruption srh etcand one pet hate or two they use official rules but do not use the offcial ban list and if you find a card bug like i did nepththys not coming back from gy after being sent there by hazy flame mantikor expect to be ignored and bug not fixed tldr good game as ever company and money grabbing tactics
its a really good game once you become invulnerable to rage quitting it for two or more weeks however i think it needs a bit of new stuff like could have more musicless pay to win yes thats it for now i dont have much stuff to put in p
early access reviewlove this game but i will still give the ros and conspros one no health for your bot just play until your driver is killed cubes health but if your driver is unprotected you are toast two create whatever you want three no premadedesigned classescons one no ability to start private matches two only one gamemode for the people under 3mil robot rating or some high ratingother than that this game is a must get

so far so good dont know what to expect down the road but graphics are acceptable right now i could only hope the prices are reasonable as i have yet to purchase one that could be the killer again
early access reviewthe game is decent and all all those people who says its better than hearthstone are probably casuals who dont even know how to play hearthstone the game is good but not as decent or close to hearthstone that being said the tutorial is longer than the duration of all the times i had s3x combined which is sad lol but worth a try thou edit seven hours into a game tried multiple decks combination some are my own some are preset by the devs and this game is double penetrated in terms of balance of course some cards in other games are op and broken but this whole game is based on that there are decks with a zero chance to win against its just that you have to get ready to press concede with diginity rather than watching your health drops thirty or something my review was to try this game but after trying to put time and experience into it nah i dont think its playable like that sorry
early access reviewthis is a very fun game to play with your friends or probably alone for me this game like super smash bros but i dont have a wii u so i was upset then i saw this game at pax and got exicted thanks for making this game
this game is cool to play fun but with friends i dont recomment playing it solo gets bored after a while at least for me people say its pay to win but i wouldnt say so maybe in pvp but pve is normal
early access reviewhonestly i lasted ten hours its still a laggy glitchy mess with all kinds of balance problems i am astonished that the developers managed to mess up yet another release given all the issues its had the most concerning thing isnt even the little glitches its that it feels like an alpha at best this should never have been released in this kind of state the first second third lol etc time
early access reviewi dont ever write reviews but this game was absolutely trash during launch even when i managed to play it is a very mediocre game at best i tricked myself into believing this game was good just because i was really craving a new mmo dont be like me
walrus sums it up in a way i totally agree sadly ive spent enough money to justify me staying for a little bit longer since i dont want that investment to go to waste i wish it couldve been betternearly impossible grind mostly the top two tiers four and five for both unlocking aircrafttanks and the aircrafttank modules forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account and even with a premium account tier five vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game this grindy element adds a pay to win mechanic horribly fd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics for a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity its a bit odd to me that it doesnt even take history into account when creating matchups for the vehicles this in addition to the fact that gaijins system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchups so we now have a game thats neither historical nor is it balanced thedancingwalrus
great game i am surpised by the quality that is is free my only complaint is the amount of game that is behind bars that you have to purchase like you buy the car then you must buy seperate skins like wtf
as a er who bought the legendary pack on the original warz i keep coming back to this game for some ing reason maybe im ing stupid or maybe this game is ing addictive despite its flaws try it and find out for yourself lmao the pvp is very exciting and the zombies are decent enough threat while pvping so i guess its okay this was launched in two thousand and twelve so dont expect top notch graphics its free now so who dafuq cares
making a video on this i played since beta invested over three hundred euros in hirez1 they do not give a about community they killed off their own official forums in favor of reddit which is easily the most cancerous place on the internet2 they do not give a about community their support is useless slow automated its impossible to get a real human response you can get banned for nothing i got banned for nothing two times took me one month to resolve it and undo that three of my friends got permabanned for hacking which never happened and you can also receive death threats via their game and that is also ok they do not care3 they do not give a about community matchmaking and ranked are ed in ranked pro player can get matched with a first time player and with a bronze player lol4 they do not give a about community most of the paid content is exclusive or behind an rng paywall5 they keep ruining the design of the site and game destroying some parts of its functionality wtf6 they do not give a about your financial investment it took them over three years to implement 2step verification up until then it was enough to get your password and steal your account no confirmation is needed to change email good luck talking with automated answers via support7 they tolerated bmbrandon for years and years even though hes the most toxic person imaginable and he was on their payroll even after he publicly shamed and flamed his own donator on twitch eventually he had to quit on his own8 eac check other reviews eac is do not install it9 ever since tencent bought them they stopped progressing they only produce skins and other paywall content they do not care about you they do not care about the game
i love it love it love it i have a whispering death whos lvl twenty and a deadly nadder whos lvl eighteen there is so many cool features and it suits all my httyd needs but i love dragons especially httyd ones like toothless and that is just my opinon p s if you want to be friends and love dragonsdinosaurs be free to friend me
early access reviewthe game has atmosphere like none otheri would gladly recommend it as its also freethe jumpscares and ambient sounds compliment the masterpiece that is spookys house of jumpscares not only is it fun to play but the game runs at a smooth 60fps has very good characters and areas to explore and will take you by surprise
"early access reviewcool game buddyi tries aq3d open beta in closed it would only take a day to reach level twelve as i heard from other players but in open beta it would take a lot longer now ive read comment and i know its a review but ae should make a site where they could also read it that way it would help them develop their game yes the games sucks right now no skill tree only four skill which i think sucks since it wont be immersive like wow where you get to choose want kind of character you are like tanker defender or a bit of both i think this was a bit rushed when i heard about aq3d i thought of all the potential it could have the moment i logged in my hopes were instanly crushed i mean seriously you already have all skills available and you could buy the other class for free except for guardian i don t hate the game i still play and hope it might slowly change and get better but really you have to grind and there are key to enter a dungeon i saw in one of there post since the limit is only three player they limit by putting keys so other players can enter why not build multiple dungeon like dungeon1 dungeon2 and etc multiple dungeon so that people can enter is ae becoming greedy i really loved aqw my friends helped me grind to level sixtyfive and helped me farm for archpaladin took me hours and days to complete all quest and i m fine with have a multiple class game makes it better who want to have the same class as everyone it just gets boring and most people start talking about aq3d and then after this post they will say to me i m an idiot and i dont know and that the game sucks and then they will say im just stating the facts yes what you guys say are true but you just have to be patient heck during the finale of the dark throne saga there were about 18k players aqw is not dead and aq3d still has potential if i were to review it i would give it seven thousand, five hundred and ten its not perfect at first just like aqw eight years ago but it was still fun so to people out there who have issues with this game don t play it and i know its just your review but if what you reviewed is not to your liking don t play it then people have diffrent taste in game me im a gamer i really play anything that gets me intrested even in aqw i wasn t a member but look at me now im level sixtyfive and no i did not use any bot cause im afraid of getting banned i farmed in shadow realm everyday after school and i did my homework after that but aq3d is kinda ok i just hate farming even today the gap between one thousand, four hundred and fifteen is about seven hundred and thirty eight thousand i see a bunch of level fifteen who i think used exp pots and gold pots boost it takes at least a week to farm for that but sice the level cap is only fifteen but when they increase the level cap they might adjust it i just hope they might improve this game soon befor its too late and by the way im a hardcore ae fan dont tell me im an idiot just because of that im not here to judge you since your the ones playing good luck and recommended"
i played a lot of trove before it came to steam and participated in alphabeta testing i have got to say not only has the game changed a lot it has improved along the way there are tons of new features more items and an over all more refined game for the uninitiated trove is a voxel based sandbox mmo where you create your character and travel through different worlds completing dungeons collecting lootgear to progress your character there are many classes in the game and more classes added regularly each class can be switched to on the fly all you need is a wardrobe in trove each player gets there own plot of land that they can take with them everywhere they go all from the start this land can be customized in anyway you can imagine as long as its withing the size limits there are also shared worlds for building called clubs that act sort of like guilds in other mmos linking all the worlds and features together is the hub hubworld is a place most trovians pass through regularly to get from place to place so its always pretty lively i completely recommend trove to anyone who is a fan of voxel based games sandbox mmos or just getting lots of loot
early access reviewwith every update the grind feels like it stretches out longer and longer expect to spend several days of gameplay to unlock that next weapon or vehicle as repair fees tacked onto every action you take ingame cut into what few credits you earn paid content doesnt get you much further purchasing ingame gold gives you very little for your money it would feel completely like a pay to win game if it did but the truth is that paying players are stuck with almost all of the same absurdly long grind as the rest of us it should be telling that despite coming up on almost one thousands hours of play i have unlocked only 13rd of the items classes and vehicles in the game and thats not drawing from a very large pool of unlockables the weapons are not fairly balanced in the slightest everyone starts with a semiauto rifle which is trash before unlocking a smg that is unusable at range but decent up close next theyll unlock higher tier smgs which are still bad at range but great up close a bolt action rifle once expensively upgraded to a onehit kill is a huge upgrade assault rifles make sa rifles obsolete lmgs manage to be even better than assault rifles t2 us and german lmgs are absurdly strong despite all the problems it has hg is built on a fantastic game engine which manages to feel open world and well paced despite all of the balance problems youll encounter the game has incredible promise and i hope the hg teams monetization and balance strategies are changed drastically soon because theyre holding back a game that could be much better with very little work
as requested by a loyal fan here is my review of sakura clicker this game was created by the same folks behind the classic sakura swimclub and sakura dungeon but instead of the visual novel flare this game instead is based upon the browser game cookie clicker where you click a cookie however in sakura clicker you are instead clicking on anime girls as you progress the girls you click on will gain more health requiring you to hire new girls who do more damage to aid in adding the enemy girls to your harem this also includes bosses gold is usually used to hire new girls but beyond this there is an underlying method of levelling girls for example to unlock abilities like added five gold per girl or twenty damage you may have to spend gold to get a hero to lv100 for an added one hundred attack bonus additionally it is possible to prestige to gain bonuses at the cost of your progress a mechanic which i enjoyed was how you could close the game but when you return you are rewarded with gold which you would have earned if you had stayed on but returning to the game may be required for fighting bosses requiring your presence to click and activate abilities gained once leveling up the main hero another aspect of the game i found interesting was how every enemy girl has a slightly different look whether it is the apparel hair or eye colour the music on the other hand does suffer from being repetitious as far as i am aware there is no story to date or lore as well as no ending or character development however there is a girl by the side of the screen whom you can customise with a small variety of free hair skin eye and clothing options for free but beyond these are microtransations for weapon clothes and hair dlc which im personally not a fan of but does not harm the core gameplay all in all it is a solid clicker game another hit by the sakura team recommend that you play the game with the music and sound effects off with the voice left on another gripe of mine would be the absence of a buff man in the game
early access reviewthis game is amazing got it for free as part of the special weekend already invested forty into the game bought it for a friend and bought the vanguard founder packthis game is well optimised already even my friend with his terrible laptop can run it on max settings well worth the money guys
early access reviewgame is trash refunding it runs terrible and gameplay is stuttering and menus freeze when opening and closing the action element of the game is completly lost on the fact you dont have any standard attacks every attackmove is a hotkey followed by spamming the r keys to create a comboits style is very tasteless on par with tera
my vote for the great because i paid award this should win because you literally arent sht if youve never bought stuff in the game everything is based around buying more to be better than others also if you want the first purchase reward dont buy it through steam you need to download the arc launcher and log in with your neverwinter account and buy your stuff through thereme and many others made the mistake of buying through steam so yeah pretty pay to win in my opinion well thats just my guess anyway maybe if youve nolifed this game for a few months you might have some decent stuff not likely though overall this game is a lot of fun in the early stages but when you become a reasonably high level you cant compete with people with some better items which you need to buy with money or trade a lot of stuff to get that much ad so prepare this game is fun but be prepared to grind a lot if youre a free to play who wants to play with the big bois
early access reviewdoes the people who defend this game paid by neowiz they do a better defense than a lawyer seriously how can they like something so and purposely made hard to halt peoples progress so that they dont have to release content on schedule
product received for freetried it for a short shooot while and was almost directly of by many diffrent aspects that made me yell more at the game than actually play it the performance was good enough i got a high end rig but i also have twenty nine ultrawide screens the crossair is not adjustable which ends up filling my screen the characters ing arms and weapon just because i have a ultrawide screen just trying to join a battle with is impoissible as only my game seemed to bug out and not join the other they also have a system anti cheat that blocks the games input meaning you cant move quit or anything if there is another window overlapping many ppl having issue with this in the forums too so yea my experience of this game is not goodtried this game once again and ended up getting fcked so hard that it just wasnt fun the issues still seems to be existing the payment model has changed from pay2win to pay4fun
this game is great if you love fun dungeons with your friends my favourite thing is the great collection of weapons and interesting crafting i havent played it much on this pc but i played it on my friends pc so i know its great i reccmend it
early access reviewstupid op cards now its become who gets the legendary first was a great game ruined by power creep sorry to say ive played from the beginning and was very impressed by the game play early mana screw problems were addressed but the constant new releases has turned it into a power shower first to get the big card out wins on the plus side rewards are very generous so you can build a collection easily and make valid decks just dont get disappointed when your carefully built board gets wiped by the kill all enemies flying monster please bring in the nolegendary leagues to get some balanced play again
this game oh where to begin well lets start off with some requirements at least five mbs internet or you will be suffering intel core i3 ddr3nvidia six hundred optional but the game is much more fun with them these are not required to play the game only to play it with decent fps and somewhat decent graphics the first stages of this game are definately going to be the hardest mostly due to the lack of tutorials you have to find things out on your own but i just cheated and went to the forums once you get past level fifteen the mount level youre pretty much requried to spend money on this game if you want a soemwhat decent mount i love supporting games like this but if its f2p then it should atleast have some options 710a good timewaster
been playing this game since the beta and i can easily say theres nothing else like it steam has a fraction of my hours since i used the launcher for many years but you can see the total here https www really like this game theres a lot of flaws for example the game is combined arms and air vs air ground vs ground and infantry vs infantry all feel very fleshed out and well crafted but where they mix often feels precariously balanced sometimes infantry dominate over vehicles and sometimes aircraft can destroy infantry with no fear of retaliation however the game features an insanely dedicated dev team who are very receptive to the community and the game is constantly getting patches and updates if youre looking for a game to sink your teeth into especially if youre looking for a social fix with your shooter i can firmly say planetside two is the only game on the market that can really deliver
this game is ing garbage all of my friends have like lets say normal games but me oh i get ed in the every single ing turn like my luck in this game is nonexistent this game like goddamn but hey i still play this game so seven hundred and ten great game
basically just the mobile phone app on the computer nothing fascinating or anything just a nice little game you can leave on in the background when you wanna chill and kill some time
this game used to be fantastic but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment to put this perspective for any new or current players gaijin have become even greeder than wargaming creaters world of tanks and that is saying alot as they have a certain reuptation every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however most if not all are overpriced premiums lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pittiful amount of exp gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles and sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as alot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehashs of old planes or tanks already in the game honestly give this game a miss all my 15k hours were played back during the golden age of the game before the br system and questionable design choices
i used to love this game on my old account i had atleast two thousands hours of gametime i picked it up again basically as a time waster because they have made it a too hard for any beginnersb pay to play afc i used to buy veteran and gold but now its useless d you need to buy gold if you want to buy anything within a few weeks of unlocking it
would not recommend between the amount of inappropiate conversations people being absolutely rude for no reason and the game shutting down i would never go back im a simple woman and im a gamer who wants to simply find a game i can enjoy not a game that has raunchy rumor all the time and stops working im sorry but i do nit recommend this game
early access reviewwhat the actual is this game this is pure man my god why did i even played this brthis game has a horrible server it keeps disconnecting everytime and this ing game is so sarcastic this game man this game sucks
early access reviewthis game is a horrible paytowin piece of garbage im putting a negative review from all four of my accounts and told all my friends some of which dont even play it to put a negative review and its staying negative until the game becomes playable this garbage made by a group of inbred degenerates could be so much better it could compete with other big fanbase games like lol csgo warframe dota two etc if they changed it just a little bit the amount of t theh spew with we updated the game and made it better is just sad please fix it also add some dmn achievements and trading cards so players get an extra reward besides some random shyt ingame a lot of players love badges and cards and maybe some tradable items that players can trade with each other through steam like skins or weapons i would also like to mention the fact that about six months ago i played and had bought some weapons and had also spent money on this trash to get some stuff i recently turned on the game to see that the game has been changed and all my stuff was gone and instead of them i had three starter robots that i dont want
compared to the other clicker casual upgrade dps games this one doesnt compare well tap tap infinity allows both left and right click buttons for massive manual damage time clickers has the cool gun stuff going clicker heroes has fast multiple level purchases this game though can be fun doesnt play as well as the others the cosmetics are cheesy and too expensive in my opinion perhaps some updates are needed
two hours is all it took fuing two i no longer have friends family neighbours the tension is insane we all fuing hate eachothers guts thank you business tour thank you you bunch of sht fuing wakers worst game i have ever played
the best military flight simulator out there but as many negative reviews show this is not a game it is a study sim with some gameplay elements on top i started playing a few weeks ago and i greatly enjoy it you will enjoy dcs world if you want to learn about aviation and want to understand how real military aircraft work you enjoy reading six hundred page technical manuals forums and wikipedia pages you enjoy spending hours watching tutorial videos on youtube you own a hotas trackir and can memorize a lot of keyboard shortcuts you have a lot of spare time you enjoy steep learning curvespersonally i love the experience i currently have about forty hours of game time logged and have spent at least twice as much time reading manuals and watching tutorials yet i feel that i still have so much more to learn it is awesome i would definitely recommend dcs world and especially the a10c dlc to people who know what they are getting themselves into if you are looking for a relaxing game where you can jump into an airplane and shoot things better look somewhere else
wow umm well i spent ten minutes trying to create an account or lookup my old star trek online account info or sign in to the old cryptic account and did several attempts to recover send my password etc etc blah blah and finally gave up signing up for a new game shouldnt be this much trial error annoyance so i gave up might try again next week if i have absolutely nothing else to play gotta say not impressed after the huge epic fail that was star trek online im just not motivated to jump through their hoops to play neverwinter
early access reviewif youre anything like me and enjoy tactical ccgs like magic or hearthstone you will love this one for some reason i will occasionally branch off to other ccgs es legends duelyst hearthstone etc but i always find myself returning to this direwolf does a really great job of providing content and it shows how much they care for their game give it a shot its free after all
played till my character reached to lvl seventy this game isnt really a p2w like tf2 u pay only to keep costumes including extra inventory slots too so overall its a good game except in pvp where the spams are real
"early access reviewsolid game probably the next pubg killer great weapon balancing nice movement skills like snowboard and your weapon attachments go over to your new weapon if you switch them totally worth it one thousand, one hundred and ten"
this game is i wait five hours for it to download and when it does it says i have to creat a account so i try to make a nickname for my character and everyone a type in it says i cant use it eight out of eight would not play again
i feel like most of the negative reviews for the game come from people who expect it to be free understandably given that it is in fact listed as free the full reality is that this is a game that works like an oldtimey mmorpg you pay a fee to be able to enjoy it in full the free version allows you to well demo it mostly though if what you want is to roam around a ginormous gorgeous map with a rifle in hand and shoot some stuff i feel like you might be satisfied with what you get anyway personally i dont mind paying ten bucks to enjoy a full version of what appears to be a perfectly functional engaging multiplayer game i used to pay that amount for a single month but maybe thats just me being old having checked out the microtransactions as well the prices really arent too obscene when accessed via steam anyway the official page offers less savings for whichever odd reason and you can pretty much do without buying any of that especially if you do end up getting a membership access which automatically grants you a set of clothes to get you through the tougher maps the core systems in place the environments are incredible and the animals are believable and natural shooting whether you prefer that to be with a bullet an arrow or a digital camera all seems to be in order too that said this isnt a shooting gallery its more in the line of a walking simulator or a crouching through the forest simulator so expect to do a fair bit of that for me that adds to the experience for someone else thats a gamebreaking flaw but if youre an old person like i am and maybe enjoyed the deer hunters from the past which also involved a lot of waiting waiting walking and waiting youll definitely enjoy this one too and frankly after testing it out im prepared to say that this game is worth a full total of four thousand and fifty bucks on all grounds that i usually judge my games by content playability replay value graphics which so happens to be about the amount i expect to be paying for it in the long run no real complaints here now if just someone would buy me a dog
product received for freesome may say this is a minecraft clone i say this is not and its own thing yes it is a block based game and has crafting and such but this has free easy to use multiplayer hosted not by the player but the devs own server both i think have great devs but they are great in different ways this game is still in early access so it has things its still yet to do that could be come anything in my eyes there is only one flaw with this game no offline mode but it not as bad as one thinks the server work fine the game can still be played on your own or with others just use a password the community is great and helpful as well devs that are active on the forums and have even asked us the community what kinds of things we wanted we asked for more grass block types and we got it xd who would have thought grass was high on that list xdbut in a joking manner we have dirt slabs where as minecraft never kept them note i dont favor minecraft or creativerse over the other as i like both edit the game is out of early access now and its still fun and has lots it can be and has had a great deal added and changed for the game that al still reflects its name and gives you tools for creativity in new ways and the community is great one to be part of edit over the twenty eighteens year id say this game is still doing good and we have had events that were fun for halloween and winter since my last edit of this review and the player models have changed but giving new features to customize them with some that were earn able from doing this last halloween event for freein game and not from the store with irl cash some even for pro players not exactly much tho outside this been done for pro players and that dlc tho yet but still say its worth it for the flashlight and glider and the upped inventory overall as well the other perks we also i feel i should say with the upped stack count being nine hundred and ninetynine per stackable item i think our characters finally by normal means can outmatch that steave and alex fellow in holding the most mass of gold blocks lol we also got the chance to tame more creatures like the event mods this year so thats another perk ill say lolin the end we mostly got more variations of current sets of blocks and not many store based recipe packs and have let the community vote for what blocks to them next too lol so the devs are still active and community always in mind
i would definitely recommend this game pros f2p four continents so if one gets stale you can warp to another massive fights get xp from kills supporting reviving ammo repairing capping points sites etc squad platoon teamwork xp gets you certs in which you use to unlock what you want whether it be skills for classes or weapons theres so many things to unlock weapons for infantry and vehicles leadership ex squad spawn beacon reuse time request reinforcements server wide etc note you will find these under the social menu skills consumables such as health kits different types of nades for different classes etc you can use certs to unlock weapons but before you spend your hard earned certs you can try any weapon vehicle attachment out in vr training go to the world terminal in a warp gate and youll see it in the bottom left green button squad platoon based gameplay very well done too much to explain with in game comms tip to mute anyone talking hit enter on the numpad to turn their volume up hit the and to turn them down hit the on the numpad you battle for resources on the map capturing holding hexes and use those resources to resupply consumables such as nades healing kits etc spawn vehicles and aircraft more squad info belowcons weapon balancing can be an issue nerf wheel comes into play at times if you buy rmt real money transaction use vr training before you do to see if you like said weap attachment vehicle or use certs for different weapons they may nerf said item down the road and make it almost useless which leaves you feeling ripped off if big changes come out for like attachments they usually refund your certs though for example theres weapons in the game that have lock on at the time you had to buy one for antiaircraft aa and antitank at if you wanted one for each then they added one that locked onto both later but that wasnt the nerf one nerf was for aircraft they severely reduced the range at which you could start locking on lock on takes four seconds mind you so now by the time you start locking on they will use flares and bug out by the then but say they already used flares and arent long gone they are behind terrain or break los which anything breaks line of site lets say all the above didnt happen and youre trying to lock onto an aircraft all they have to do is keep moving and theyll be out of range to finish the lock on aircraft are overpowered in this game they counter vehicles infantry and base defenses this is in the hands of a decent pilot of course great pilots are scary not all aircraft are created equal either note then again if you get with a group that will actually work together you can get a squad of maxs a class that uses resources and is much tougher than normal infantry with antiaircraft aa weapons or ha heavy assault you can create a no fly zone swatting any enemy air that flies by teamwork is heavily rewarded in this game for example field of tanks in front of your base get a squad of heavies or maxs and all fire on a single tank at a time and watch as your squad takes them all out one by one and oh hey theres another squad member giving you ammo while doing it and hey theres a medic rezing anyone that gets downed oh look theres a infiltrator using recon devices showing you where all the enemies are he also hacked the turret across the way at the enemies base and is shooting them from behind with their own weapons all the while your entire squad is getting bonus xp for being at the squad waypoint defending a base taking out enemy armor assists and just for being in a squad this is a mmo after all people client based hit detection this means you could be safely behind cover on your screen and still get dead a second later because on the enemies screen theyre still hitting you same thing applies to you of course shooting an enemy theres a lot of minor things that irk me but thats the same with many mmos can take a long time to get certs especially if youre not playing medic or engineer one cert every 250xp or something like that but thats expected sort of they dont want to give you everything right now its not that bad and with the recent changes its a lot better tbhadvice for new players find an outfit guild and ask questions when people are talking you can turn them up default keypad and turn them down keypad you can also mute anyone talking by hitting keypad entervery handy shortcuts indeedif you see someone on the battlefield and you want to send them a whisper hold q and you will get many options such as sent whisper add friend ignore etc you can also right click their name in the chat window if it has brackets around it like when someone kills you you can right click their name and send them a tell you can whisper people across servers in all soe games iirc do a google search on specifics hit q to spot enemies it helps your team and you get bonus xp keep in mind if enemies are close they can hear you be especially mindful if youre and infiltrator this can get you killed look up some tutorials on youtube some are outdated but most still give good information try out weapons attachments vehicles in vr training before spending certs or buying with cash when you join a squad you can filter by all squads on that continent has people in your outfit etc when you join a squad you can hit insert to immediately deploy near your squad leader so you dont have to trek all the way to the front lines the u key will redeploy you think of suicide but doesnt affect your stats for example if youre on a kill streak redeploying will not affect your kill streak you can redeploy to another spawn location kill an enemy and you will be on an eleven kill streak etc if youre going to pull armor be an engineer so you can repair yourself if youre an infiltrator you can hack enemy terminals turrets default is to go up to it when you see the words appear hold e and it will hack it give you xp and turn the terminal turret to your teams and only your team can use it it stays that way until either its hacked back by their infils or it gets destroyed you can use this to spawn vehicles behind enemy lines you can spawn a sunderer find a hiding spot and deploy it deploy is default b and you cant deploy in a red circle on the minimap or a white circle that another sunderer shows up with meaning you cant deploy near another deployed sunderer then your team can spawn in that sunderer and take the base destroy enemies from behind if youre base is getting sieged by the enemy dont stay in spawn for the love of vanu get on ze point new players just stay in the spawn and do nothing basically so what if you die heres an idea get in a squad platoon coordinate all spawn maxs engies medics and max crash the point take it and force the enemy out of your base teamwork people teamwork you can use voice call outs default v and you can request ammo or a heal taunt etc if your voice comms gets screwed up go into voice options uncheck the use voice box and recheck it hit m to open the map top drop down shows all the worlds the orange blips show how much fighting is going on there are also squad deploy and instant action buttons on the bottom left friendly fire is on dont just spam nades and such if theres alot of your team mates around and if you friendly fire too much your weapons will be locked i might add more later but youtube is your friend just do a search for a guide tips all in all this is an amazing game and you should definitely try it
another instance of trion moneygrubbing the community when this came to steam i got as many friends as i could to playnot because i tried it yet but because the concept was enticing we grinded up to max by doing as much as we could got a few of the other classes and all around was just having a good time we stopped playing and a few months ago when dragons came out i gave the game a look and found that i could simply buy a dragon and not have to do the extensive grinding i quit after wasting much time attempting to grind the mats then recently i looked over the game again having in the past known it was good and hoping more that the developers fixed the grindtopay ratio i learned sadly it just got worse i once did recommend this game but as trion goes their games dont last long it sucks this almost made it to the front page on most popular
early access reviewat the moment aq3d is lacking that said it also has the potential to go vary far the game is still in early access and to be honest it shows they only have three of the four starting classes from aqw and one class that you can pay to buy the mobs so far look good nothing out standing but thats part of aqs charm and the combat is almost the same as aqw just with some added depth but the burning question is this is advenure quest 3d worth playing yes sure it needs some work but after they get aq3d up to full throttle it will be as good or even better then the last two installments
"early access reviewdo you like moba gameplay such as dota two league of legends hon and other similar games but you also like big ing spaceships with big guns shooting fiery balls of doom and lasors at other spaceship than this is the game for you wait no longer and install nowbasicly youre going five vs five with a spaceship of your choice capturing points and eventually trying to capture the enemy base the more points you capture the more resources you gain per second and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage giving you advantage over the enemy ships currently you can choose between fifteen or something ships but this is still alpha more ships to come for sure you got tanky ships high damage ships long range ships close range attack ships assasin ship like you go in stealth mode pop up next to enemy ship do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there support ships repair yourself and allies or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies and some mixed ships that have a little of everything i can only say that ive liked this game so far there are some downsides like laggy servers like one in five games for me are laggy and one in fifteen or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg but that is what you get when you play alpha release other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game unless you alter some files which is really anoying if you are one of the few people belgiumfrance that use azerty keyboards because the controls are for qwerty which means you control the ships movement with zqsd instead of wsad you can fix this by pressing altlshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode but than you will not be able to type properly all in all great game i am sure they will fix these problems in the near future and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps and modes to play i rate it seven thousand, five hundred and ten"
this game is complete and utter i wanted to give it a chance but of course the first day they were having server issues so i decided to wait it out played for a little bit but still was not impressed graphics are horrible youre lucky to be alive after ten seconds after spawn since peple just seem to sit there and kill you for no damn reason this being mentioned there is no pve servers at all the battle ground spawn is literally the most thing ive ever seen in a video game it spawns you inside of like five other players and everyone just waits right there at the spawn to get kills there is literally no point in even putting their halfminded thought into creating a map youd be better off making it a ten foot square room and saying here you go guys you have to try and join a server like five times before the game either doesnt crash or make you sit through the long loading screen just until finish and it notifies you that you have been disconnected from the server the only positive thing i could say about this game is that its free not that anyone would pay money for this peice of game created by people with the brains the size of hampsters ive literally became so mad with this game i dont even care how bad my grammar is in this review if anything they will understand most of it fully do not even waste your time with this game they will probably delete this comment or ban me but i dont really care you have been warned
"holy this game is so good if you like skillbased fps space and mobas then this is the game for you the free to play model is playtowin two of the best ships to play with are starter ships i love how they made some ships eligable to be better than others but theyre waaay harder to play with ive been practicing with one of these hard ships and recking like crazy took me four hours of fun free gameplay to afford the interceptor get this game then get gud one thousand, one hundred and ten lizards would totes lathe again"
early access reviewi am rather surprised i havent typed up a review for this gem yet i backed since it released in two thousand and fourteen it was a bit basic but they continued on with small hotfixes and massive updates and was the only game i knew it wasnt going to fail within backing terms every aspect strings my sweet spots good graphics on the ships moba teamplay and best of all large ships this game is reasonably priced and worth every penny nothing is too overpowered and its not paytowin the developers are extremely generous with its wonderful price tag free weekends occasionally and fifty off one thousand and ten
one never played these sandboxcrafting games decided to check what was all this about2 started the game and had no idea what to do just followed the simple instructions on my screen3 got something going harvested and collected a few things built some walls and no roof and stayed inside it afraid of the monsters in the dark4 made a bell to tame pets and got a leafie super cute and adorable my best friend in this lonely world5 leafie went missing after i was a couple of mins away from keyboard waiting for a few crafts6 i panicked went out all the way to search for leafie and reached a tundra7 attacked a giant tundra chicken and got killed8 end of journey all i ever wanted was to find my missing friend leafie would do it all over again
early access reviewask me about forty six months ago whether or not to reccommend this game i would have said yes me and my friend loved playing this as riflemen firing from afar with iron sights we were saving up for the bolt action rifle not spending money meant we would have had to play for a while but it wasnt too slow and a few hours of play would have got us the rifle it was honestly quite a fun game but we got sidetracked and played other games and i recently decided to start playing again hardly anything can be bought with in game currency and the cost of the weapon has risen meaning what would have taken hours may very well take weeks i used to enjoy this game and in f2p games i will usually throw in ten every now and then if the game keeps me entertained for a couple of months and i can get through it without feeling disadvantaged not purchasing something i was on track to do so but now i cannot support this game do not install
start a game four of my team mates abandon two of my enemies abandon on of them says you know we will win me challenge accepted buy three rapiers get two rampages win1010 would 1v3 again
the game itself isnt bad but from a porting standpoint it is i mean yeah you can grab the game and its still fun but from the mobile version this port is still pretty much the same they didnt even bother to fix the resolution just adding glorified black bars to the sides of the screens in short good game but the port itself was pretty much useless

runs faster with better gui game balance and deck management than magic the two lane gimmick works well i have to tip my hat to the programmers and designers they could have mailed it in and created a cookie cutter buggy card game but they actually made a top notch quality game one of the better trading card battle games on steam still looking for the perfect one to absorb my time this is not it but good for casual games every once in a while
early access reviewdo not play this and if you do dont play as germany because they were originally a fair opponet until the great nerfining were they they got nerfed so much that they have to pay royalties to nerf and defitinly dont play as tanker because ninety nine of the time you will get killed by and infantry to the point you fear them more then tank destroyers which are tanks meant for destroying other tanks and dont forget the ptrd which one shots infantry cars with its infinite range accuracy and damage seriously developers fix the god damn game rather than adding in more and more half baked content that is pointless or makes the game even harder for german players which already have it hard enough why the hell am i even saying anything the developers wont listen to the community also did i mention to fix the god damn servers being hosted on pluto all the time like jesus christ
early access revieweternal is a great fast paced card game with really good and well thought out game design i recommend it to anyone looking for a card game thats not hearthstone or a card game with a much faster pace then mtg
well a month back this game was bad but cool lots of crashes hard to start but nice to play with friends the devs dont seem to be doing anything at all to make the game better just to kill it even more than it already is and add lots of skins to earn money ofc today was the rip for me i would like to see this being a good game but like things are going i have almost to no hope
a year ago i would tell anyone to stay away from this game today my point still stands as you can sink many hours in to it if you have the determination to get through all your deaths and in to the later point of this game
diablo two ff7 materia system solid arpg with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery and a brilliant end game with great features a lot of the space between can really really suck though as you bottleneck your build at the gear level needing very specific number color and connection schemes of slots and needing those setups on items with decent stats as well highly recommended for the most hardcore and the most casual normal players may find themselves bored and leaving in the mid game or playing a large number of characters and fighting with stash space
not only does it allow you to disassemble and reassemble expensive or illegal for civilian ownership firearms without the risks it is handy if you can find a rifle you own to learn how to take it apart before you take it apart in real life
i exclusively play tank simulator battle with a premium captured tank you can rampage through the ennemy ranks without being noticed this game mode is a pay to win the fun is gone
early access reviewhoorah this game deserves more more than a whole universe galaxythis game is not really meant to be f2p at least ten eur is good why making it free to play i just dont get itbtw its not such a bad game and the balance is good they update it and at least the people who made fractured space are trying and trying and they wont stop trying not like the others like just do it for over twenty three years receive the money alight then stopping with the updates and etc but this aa it aint like this fractured space the developers admins etc are really good as you can see on the forums yo people start making games something like fractured space thinkg about the game not only for the money think about the players not the money no need p2w such a dirty game such not a bad game i recommend you this game you wont want to refund it i am tellin youhave fun on the space battle field haha and dont forget the gamma gammawonder how to type on all chat just hit enter then write all chat messagealso i didnt knew the ship sentienel supporter gotta help dem
a pretty fun game but one major problem of mine is that i have to deal with obnoxious messages in and out of a game it mainly comes from the use of the megaphones its really annoying and i would love it if i could block it one other thing bothering me is that there isnt much variety when it comes to black characters overall its a fun game i just wish i had more choices when i play more specifically chat settings and character options i mean there are alot of nonblack characters theres even a ing gorilla the community is terrible by the way
this game is at everything great no costs only if you want prmium with wich you can trade nice gameplay many modes wich you can play from ctf cp mann versus machine and much more and you get random itmes wich you can for ever use great game just give it a try it will be worth
"currently the game is no longer fun gaijin is just over the entire community unless your russian and only sees us for the money in our wallet we have been bring up pointing out and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse the only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they might pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel however this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel oh by the way they are under a nda which makes them completely worthless to begin with an obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from gaijins part the t3485 for example very rarely catches fire explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank there was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a ten spread between vehicles to seven so for example tiger iis dont have to fight tanks from the korean war last i checked the poll was at about three thousand, one hundred for yes and thirty for no gaijin has offically stated they will not change the br system and that it is perfectly fine despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree if you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier three is playing russian vehicles also on a observasional note the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations just saying they seem to be paying more attention to a certain nation than others as the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste your money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian the only reason i have not stoped playing this completely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it"
early access reviewi love this game reminds me of world of warcraft its deffinitly different from aqw although the community is just full for raging little kids the game its self is quiet enjoyable i would suggest it if you want a nice peaceful mmorpg game to just relax and enjoy
early access reviewthis game is literally everything pubg should have been on launch this game also has an interesting endgame scenario instead of being the last player alive to achieve victory a heli flies down and drops a ladder and offers extraction for a total of four passengers to escape from the blizzard you may think well that isnt too much fun players will just camp the ladder up into the heli that is true however to keep that playstyle from being abused too much after a certain amount of time players are revealed on the map forcing a potential extraction or intense gunfight while in pubg its whoever can stay prone the longest until you spot a potential kill great idea and for me personally well executed it brings some freshness to the genre gun play is great too also the game is faster than pubg but its not over in ten minutes either its just the right amount of time there is so much more but ill let you all explore this game yourself of course the game has its problems too as many do some minor frame drops and lag here and there from what i have experienced but its not game breaking at all nor a reason not to play it note im comparing this to pubg because they are so damn similar an many many ways and i feel this game does it all one thousand times better and its free one thousand and ten
710overall if you enjoy tes universe this game is good more complex than hearthstone less complex than magic however it is pay to win like pretty much every other free to play game you do not stand a chance against someone who spent money on lets say the dark brotherhood dlc finally i cant help but notice after playing this game for over half a year before steam release it seems to follow the motto one step foward two steps back
waste of time ive spent more time loading the game just to get instantly disconnected from solo play than i have actually playing the game you have to pay to play other games which is t just play dayz h1z1 literally any of their compettition is better than them
early access reviewyes i did not play this game for long yet i intend to spend more time on it though looks pretty cool and solid only thing i did not like was that someone wanted me to be kicked of the team play just because i am a noob to the game really i am sorry that i shot at you but when the game started all hell broke loose and everybody was just shooting i did not know scratch so i just started shooting to whoever was closeset oops that was a mistake then i was still trying to figure out the controls and interface and they say i am just camping come on it is the first time ever i got into the game and you scowl at me like that seriously that was a bit rude man i really am sorry i shot at you please forgive me wait i have an answer next time just be in the other team and you can take out on me ha now that will be more than fair hey cmon mate lets make some peace and shake on itoh ya the game looks ok for now
the game is a grind this game is very unclear on many aspects even after tutorials you are left to searching online for answers to your questions choose the wrong selection no confirmation for the selection and ohh sorry no going back win three ranked matches for a whole fifteen gold one hundred gold a booster pack of six cards so you have to win twenty ranked duels per pack duplicates beyond what your deck can hold are possible why would you set up the hs dust system when you make this kind of a grind required for new cards grindy omg so grindythe duel lane is nice but not an orginal idea as so many have described it as legends of norrath did this first i believe and that game was out for a very long time visuals and sounds are well done server stability seems solid ive never given a free game a thumbs down until now this game could be a lot of fun but no p2w or dont play take care d
ive been playing this for nearly a year now before i start the steam download of smite is buggy so go download it from the official site its not as bad but still crashes and disconnects frequently i love this game so lemme list all the cons first yes the game has possibly the worst hardware ive ever seen players get disconnected every two or three matches on average and every patch released completely trashes the game launcher forcing you to manually delete all game files and install the game again and dont count on official support either hirez clearly takes customer service lessons from ea the community is toxic and hostile like any other mobas or competitive games just as russian players famously ruined dota two for everybody spanish and latin american players suffer from the same notoriety in smite most of the time for good reason but i wont go into the details the euw server is basically to be avoided at this point for people whose first or only language is english i would highly recommend hirez make languagebased servers just like in star wars the old republic to help reduce cultural clashes and miscommunication britain is no longer part of the eu anyway so theres that the game itself is awesome if you manage to get it running by some miracle of the gods speaking of gods oh man where do i begin as a mythology nerd i can say without a doubt the gods in the game are presented in respectful and lorefriendly ways ninety five of the time and smite easily has the best skins in any moba ever however balancing is apparently not the primary concern of the developers and even diehard fans of the game will admit this i have ptsd from lokis sound effects and im sure im not the only one guardians deal way too much damage and matchmaking is so broken even famous smite youtubers make fun of it see mythymoo despite all its flaws smite is good immersive fun the third person mode combat makes everything feel more alive and engaging and thats probably the best thing about smite the sound design department deserves a raise as well i wish there was lore explaining why the gods are all fighting each other but thats not central to the game you wont care why because the sheer notion of gods fighting each other is awesome enough on its own my favourite gods are chinese and i highly recommend ao kuang the dragon king of the eastern seas hes very hard to master but you can literally eat other gods with his ult nuff said and then theres everybodys favourite monkey sun wukong dynasty warrior fans will also be pleased to know guan yu is in the game as well and his beard and green dragon crescent blade are awesome as always seven hundred and ten not a perfect game but best moba out there right now
early access reviewoh the balance issues if you get dropped into a crap location your best option is suicide seriously if you dont get a decent weapon nearby you really have no chance after about one minute and when you blast some poor sucker in the first few seconds with your shotty and he has a knife you kinda feel bad for them but what sucks beyond belief is the number of times you get caught in furniture and other props its a major designengine failure that makes it so frustrating the game is not worth playing until they fix it
this game was great as soon as the dev team realesed it on steam few years ago not many people play it but now that the last update with the servers on for the record is released everything can be purchased with ingame credits i recommend you to give it a test with friends and also an oportunity if you like space games this one is easy to understand and fun to play needs a boost of players
early access review85 hours in and my friends and i have finally started to minecraft the game exploiting loopholes glitches and creating spawn farms it took eightyfive hours for us to get to the point where we started hoarding for megabuilding and doing mass corruption runs im impressed i want more
planetside two is and with no doubt the fpsmmo out there the game is simply massive the game is free but if you want to buy stuff like camo guns and stuff you have to get station cash which is the ingame money in my case i never bought anything with station cash just a two bucks small pack off steam the other way you can get upgrades and weapons is by getting certs which you gain by killing enemy players repairing vehicles and units though many of these weapons are kind of expensive in terms of certs and it takes a while to get some of them but in time you start getting certs and using them to upgrade your vehicles and your characters shields andor qualities if you are new to fpss the gameplay could be a little bit confusing and hard to understand but once you get the idea and the whole concept you enter into a new level of battle forget about call of duty or battlefield those games look tiny and insignificant next to the massive idea behind ps2 total war is unleashed every day between the three factions introduced in the game go nc go it is not necessary to buy weapons in my honest opinion but the base weapons you start with especially for the nc are wild and sometimes hard to manage due to the recoil but in time you get used to it battles develop in a massive scale you get to see dozens of tanks battling each other aircrafts dogfighting in the limitless sky hundreds of soldiers shooting and firing everywhere total chaos that is rewarded with a fun time even more if you are part of an outfit which makes things much more fun and interesting once you get to understand the game you feel the need to keep on playing even to the extent that you forget about your whole library and cant quit the excellent approach of this game if you are looking for a whole new experience in multiplayer gaming planetside two is for you i totally recommend this game for all gamers plus it is totally free

if you think this game is full of 8yearolds because its free youd be correct if you think that this game is full of jerks youd be correct if you think this game is full of hackers youd be correct that puts people away from this game many people also put themselves away from this game because of how difficult it can be it has a really high skill ceiling one of my favorite parts of the game itself is that its a first person shooter dude theres a mode thats based around medieval times with no guns to be honest thats probably the most realistic part of this game no im kidding but seriously though theres so much variety that really any type of gamer can enjoy this with practice or just messing around if you like to play competitively go ahead you wanna play the game to win but you dont want the pressure of being good play casual if you wanna straight up mess around deathmatch or have everyone on the server be friendly go on orange like cosmetics that make the game more snazzy trade or waste your money but dont buy anything from the mann co store unless its an exclusive item the community sometimes is absolute crap but i havent really experienced that most people ive met have been really nice to me i like to play the game and trade to get cosmetics skins and other stuff that i like and maybe profit along the way thank you to everyone who isnt an absolute jerk in the community and makes my life seem better every day specifically everyone on my friends list who is actually my friend go ahead an add me if you want we can play some time i accept all requests but i will ask you who you are if youre new and need advice im here but yes i highly recommend this game just tip dont wear the ghostly gibus please just dont
valve do your goddamn jobs and out of your stupid noteams flat organizational work no bosses structure maybe if you actually forced people to work instead of taking up whatevers easiest or trendy at the time youd have some good games or actually make games or updates even ea of all people has this down tf2 was on an equillibrium with the rest of valves titles csgo and dota two for a long time but then somehow the teams got so lopsided that you have five people working on tf2 and so now youre irrelevant and unless you reboot this game with consistent updates its on a downwards slope towards imitating csgo nobody gives a about vr i cant ing justify one thousands bucks or even five hundred or two hundred or one hundred for a vr headset with no games why dont you actually make launch titles or games for vr if youre so deadset on vr technology youre supposed to be a ing game company but no youre valve corporation
well it starts off as being a bit of a spammy game but once you get to know how the attacks work and really how to play the game it becomes a lot more fun i recommend this game to any one that enjoys super smash bros or rivals of aether if you buy the game when you have enough coins to buy a character i recommend buying mirage one of her weapons the scythe is fairly complicated but is very fun to use once learned her other weapon the spear is fairly easy to learn but hard to master
despite my hours i have played this game over a few years now and i have occasionally checked in on how its doing taking into consideration the devs and their actions also the track this game is heading down it could have been great at what it was designed to do but the devs failed the fans and the fans failed to push the devs from the beginning there were numerous server issues a few years ago there was a point when the game was basically unplayable also the devs love micro transactions so much they turned this game into the equivelent of a slot machine in las vegas micro transactions can be ok if they come in small quantites but when the game is built on them its a bit exsessive with the hours of all of me and my friends combined we have close to around twentythree hundreds hours and its safe to say we are all displeased with how the game has turned out the one shimmering light in the void that is this game is the great community it has over the years throughout its popularity and the decline recently the community has be a constant bright spot for the game and one of the best i have experienced the people may be patient but the devs will be the death of this game
sublimely magnificent game which put your mind at easecan be played with one hand or no hand great for exercising your fingers while exorcising and purifying monsters yet getting lots of gold making you feel extremely rich just by sitting down looking at the screen
early access reviewslowly but surely killing their own game decided to spend the money sponsring streamers than actually updating the game in good ways its laggy at the start of the game animations are probably worse than minecraft hitboxes are completly broken plenty of cheaters to add ontop of that but thats expected from a f2p game that spend money on streamers and not somewhat decent anticheat
game was great until patch seven hundred released why do i have to continue playing with the imitation from heroes of the storm talent tree switching to play hots makes me feel more genuine time to sell my 4k account for some
back in twenty sixteens i would not have recommend this game because of the meet your match update i dropped from tf2 since this time but now ive started playing tf2 again and damn it feels great even if its not the same game like years ago i still got the feeling of the good old game fun fact i think ive spent more time trading than actually playing the game it was fun910
school of dragons is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game set in the universe of the twenty tens criticallyacclaimed dreamworks animations film how to train your dragon and its sequel step into the life of a viking dragon rider and journey beyond the isle of berk to the mainland continent and the surrounding islands home to dozens of exotic dragons train your dragon from birth join clans and unite with your fellow dragon trainers ride on the backs of these majestic winged beasts and relive the thrill of how to train your dragon in stunning graphical detail free to play is what i would say if i was paid to promote this very bad game
i came into this game knowing what it would be like since i have played it on mobile this game is well polished it has great sounds animations and art why am i not recommending this game it is perfect for mobile but on the pc it just doesnt fit this is a game that is built to check at different time intervals throughout the day it is not something that can be actively played im not able to sit down in a one hour session and get anything useful done since most things have immense time limits my advice to the developers is to curate more content for the pc version instead of free to play slap a price on it i wont be buying in game packs simply because its not worth it ill be playing other games this is just a cash grab on the desktop
the whole game is great this is one of those games that just nailes it but the money system is terrible want a new gun pull out you credit cardwant an animal liscence pull out your credit cardwant to play the game pull out your credit card
early access reviewthe bullet spray on the weapons are so random meaning its just luck if you kill someone there is no skillset in this game and dependent on luck i would not reccomend wasting your time to download this game
early access reviewnot as childish as fortnite not as intense as pubg unique competitve fun game progression seems to be polished af only lags very briefly fifteen games compared to most releases nowadays that gets a one from me very fun with buddies
positive an extreme amount of variety in gamemodes weapons classes base gameplay is satisfying addicting and just plain fun lots of cosmetics and with a price free to play and not pay to win free content updates keep the game fresh ways of playing exceed that of a generic shooter friendly community neutral the way the tf team updates the game is very problematic as its essentially six months of nothing then a giant update with lots of content and then again five months of nothing prefered would be a medium update every twenty three months to keep matters fresh negative the game isnt exactly the most polished bugs are found in several corners and while most of them arent gameplay impacting to the level that youll find yourself blaming a bug for a death its just ugly ten years of updates on the source engine can do a number on ya making the game somewhat unstable and unoptimized the death of community serversthis game is something special alright not only was it with me for seven years now but its also something life changing most of my people in my friendslist i have met via tf2 and you know what they say your friends also affect you team fortress two is responsible for some of the most fun i had in a videogame and it will probably stay like for that several years to come and here comes the tragedy community servers have been what made tf2 extremely fun to me playing with friends people you know on a famillar enviorment now thats gone because the tf team wanted to make the game more consistent and streamlined for newcomers people will never get to experience a community server ever again unless its some weird memeshit like saxton hale and thats awful i still enjoy the game i still play it with the friends i made on community servers but i just question players that didnt experience said community servers where will they make their friends casual servers are about as personalityfree as your average overwatch character you wont make any friends there youll always play with strangers but dont let this distract you tf2 is an amazing timeless classic with the most solid gameplay available in shooters im just rambling
this is probably one of the greatest and most addictive games ive ever played some people have compared it to lol but on steroids and in 3d its a great team competition game its in space using capital ships i dont know what else anyone could ask for d highly recommended keep up the good work ecg basically you captain a capital ship with a specific set of abilities and you have to work with four other people against five other people to try and capture their base its great teamwork and a lot of fun after reading some reviews this is not a pay to win game you can buy all the dlc and it will not help you win a match its a combination of team composition teamwork and skill implants increase a specific ability in your ship a bit not light and day you need to know what ships can deal with what pick your targets strategically and work as a team this is seriously one of the greatest games ive ever played
early access reviewone of the best games i ever playedstraight upgreat game its team basedgreat gameplay and its only in alpha aaa if you missed out on the free weekend where you if you logged on and you got the game for free then you missed out big besides that its worth the buy in for the early accessits just a great game if you like space ship types games again one of the best games i ever played
pay to win i liked it for a hot second but then i found out how cheap it is if you just buy the overly expensive items whats the point in strategy if you can just pay to automaticly have more money and health per round decrease your opponents health by two every fifteen seconds weaken all bloons on your side by one level automaticly and transfer bloons on your side to theirs with added camo andor lead upgrades thats all one tower that can be yours if you just buy five thousands coins even if i bought money for this game i wouldnt use something like that no game should have something that broken and worst a lot of people i found do it when a match is even it is fun but it isnt when you have the chance for a instant lose would recommend otherwise but not with that in the game
vanilla wot takes quite long time to finish a match large maps and have a arty that what makes it fun for me on vanilla wot what makes it fun in wot blitz is it only take like three minutes to finish a match sometime small maps and no arty that what make wot blitz fun for me
ive barelly gotten into but wow its a great clicker game you can play it for a while and not be borred if you choose the right path it has tons of upgrades and good graphics its the best clicker game one thousand and ten would play again sorry if you dont know that meme
early access reviewlet me preface this with the fact that i have played this game for years now i started this game when the only modes you could play were training and battle there were no respawns and no objective other than to kill the other team and have the best robot i loved this game allow me to walk you through my experiance one spend fifty hours grinding to level one hundred with friends2 spend fifty hours and some money to support the devs grinding and coming up with an amazing megabot idea3 spend seventy hours and some money to keep the subscription up building your megabot and grinding for money for parts4 new update oh loot drops uh ok oh my megabot is entirely red why oh no cpu they removed megabots thanks for ruining a game devs if you want this to come back as a playable game you need to remove all these updates bring it back to what the game used to be about creation and imagination as for right now do not give these people money or time this game has gone from an amazing free team based sandbox vehicle battleground to another fine example of terrible devs
i amt not frim ukrain i am frim russia theret is veri big differenc yes stay away from the germans they are verty big noob hacker
early access reviewinsane for a free game to compete not only well but better than pubg and other payfor battleground games a plethora of guns that not only look and sound great but are well rounded and all have their pros and cons
the only thing better than playing a dnd game is playing a tabletop dnd game inside this dnd game or perhaps maybe a picture of a brandy snifter insid a picture of a brandy snifter snl
early access reviewi mean a lot of people say they made the game better but a lot of high level players disagree with this the updates when they added more weapons like the lock on rocket launcher but here i have to say that the newest update changes everything for the old players because they have access to everything in the game now that is normal because they achieved it from playing the new players can now get everything and boast i would like them to make the chest better fro the people above lvl seventy or something but much weaker for the newer players and it gets better
early access reviewfirst day playing rather suck through a straw second third and fourth day playing abandoned straw and proceeded to on folks fifth day trying to front flip my snowboard into the heli in hopes that it will launch me across the ing cosmos so that i may forget i ever played pubg overall thought fundislikes sometimes feels like im playing a mobile version of an fps
this game is a freegame which is really interesting and nice physics of driving but you need to give money to earn new cars and that sucks hard fun for a little ride but i dont think itll last long
early access review o i used to highly recomend this game now with the new loot system loss of a tech tree and lack of block teir there is really no reason to play it if you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want or you can just pay for it sadly it looks like the money men won out with this game they got rid of all the good stuff so little kids can just hop on and get everything they want or buy what they want if you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that took time effort and game knowledge your looking at the wrong game now this has gone over to the kiddy freemium side it was a great game that made you want to work to unlock better guns wheels and armor now you can just get the best items in the game if you do well in a match i left after the huge bot update that had everyone hidding behind the big bot in the front because it got really boring like cod got you just shot back and forth until you killed the medic bots behind the huge bot so i left and now when i come back hoping to find that they evened things out and maybe added a few more game modes i sadly find a great game has been gutted inorder to make more money it kind of seems like the game manager went on vacation leaving the money men and the scripters to go nuts while there are some new funish macanics there is now a lack of any restrictions want a snipermedicaa bot sure why not kids have fun we used to have to carefully craft our machines for a role like defender attacker wall tank you name it we had to come up with a solution on how to fill that roll we only had so many bots to make before they charged us for it making us carfully construct our machines now you get as many slots as you want and can go bot happy while i do like that they use a workshop allowing you to use other poeples bot designs as long as you have the stuff for it that is a small plus in all of the new negative aspects of this game
early access reviewthe game clearly isnt finished yet but for an alpha the game plays very well it has more of a tug of war feeling tham other mobas its not just about farming creep and pushing towers since there are neither atleast not in the game mode i have played visually the game is stunning and there are may different ships you cant play as with varrying levels of customization the is a microtransaction system inplace much like league of legends you collect in game currency credits to spend on ships crew members and ship upgrades or you can buy platinum for all the same things plus skins for you ships all in all i give the game eight hundred and ten
early access reviewlooking for bad review not for this gemewhat is pluses in this game great atmosphere five good maps one of them seems like dust2 with different textures great physics easy to playaim but mouse moveement so smooth a bit hard to control intuitive interface donate only for banges and masks for your charaster only three hundred mb size of the game english and russian language a lot of serverswhat is minuses bad recoil animation only one mode deathmatch bad buy interfacebut its ok for early accessthis is first game made by russians revelopers i think only warteam know how to make great games like that
""
early access reviewjanky as all living hell and not in a good way the first person camera has your guy nearly the sight into his eyeball making it impossible to aim and third person is no better with the reticle swinging all over the place even the charecter movement is pretty subpar i know this was supposed to be a joke but it has enough thought into it as a fart joke
early access reviewmediocre game but some real annoying thingswhen you make contact with another player wheter it be friend or foe you teleport ontop of his headeven with mouse accel off it feels like its onknife if glitchy sometimes it hits sometimes it doesnt seems random
early access reviewdevs are so out of touch with this gameboring reviews on steam by who doesnt accept meta changes tiers wont come back deal with itit isnt about tiers its about the terrible drop system and lack of actual progression now had a first place game and got twenty cones never even used a cone in my lifei think the new robocraft is really fair to new users i have been playing for a couple of days and i am full of stuff to recyclewas being shot at by homing rockets from the skies while in a two hundred cpu game with a new friend two hundred wat new players get jack add a steady income after gamelike before and this problem goes away matchmaking is quite literally nonexistant game was fine before this a bit grindy but fine this is not worth playing if you are a new player
early access reviewmost fun i have had in a new game in a long time learning curve is there but very slight in my opinion rules of the game are easy to follow and understand user interface is pleasent the premium real money currency is unneeded as gaining experience and credits through game allows you to master the starter ships and after only a couple of matches i believe i was able to credit a new rig and played the heck out of it before i went back to a starter ship to build more experience in another faction fun game glad to be a part of the alpha stage excitedly looking forward to beta and the full release of fractured space do not let the moba title scare nondotaleagehots players away this is another capture points playerversesplayer teambased your skill as a pilot shines your skill and i really like that aspect of the game
this game has been a blast to play purchasable items are a bit overpriced but they dont feel necessary to aquire in order to enjoy the game the playercreated content is a great addition to the game as well and can make the dungeon queue times fly by
early access reviewonly thing i dont have a problem is the content overall they did do a good job over the years with a majority of the content but lets be very honest here we got players on this game who are pretty stupid and by that lets say like majority have an iq of five they dont have anything better to do than just sit around and bash n troll each over over stupid game currency or we they also lie about a lot of what they do inreallife just to make themselves imitating and this applies on aqw as well community is legit cancer so thats one very major downside next some developers make way too many reworks devalues the original rares the real veterans spent time to obtain all those years maybe be more creative instead of copying stuff yeah and maybe also not seeing certain players as special because i cannot recall how many ae players on twitter beg the developers for random special rares because they thought they were special they need to do this for all ex and current moderator and testers because they end up getting an unfair advantage by loading rares that wont be removed from their accounts so the rework and loaders is another very major setback now im speaking for everyone on this one biggest one none of the staff members were able to ever address bots way too many of them yes they were originally on aqw but now ive seen a few of them on aq3d now i personally spoke with the lead moderator for aq3d regarding this once nothing has been done about that and same story for aqw nothings been done after sending a email in concern there are far more bots on aqw than aq3d but without anyone dealing with the botters on both games gives the cheaters a bigger and of course an unfair advantage now these are three major reasons why i do not recommend this game nor would i recommend the other version this is also why it has gone downhill ever since two thousand and twelve if the ae staff were to assess and do something about these key points there is a chance id see hope for ae again its also why i dont come on both games that often these dayslucariooriginal aq player since june 2005aqw player since beta testing in june 2008aq3d player since alpha testing in august two thousand and fifteen
i suggest more maps with different capture point placements the game is good so far and i like it but i noticed that theres a shortage of people playing the game or i was just too late playing it most of the time it takes around ten mins waiting in pvp mode i guess ill have to do coops for now
i was happily suprised ive played all the main wow guild wars two and so on but neverwinter brings me back to a time in my gaming that i had a great time playing i am working my way to lv seventy now so tis all a getting to know my way arouns but the game really helps you alone ive been to new areas much quicker tna nay other game as a newbi so its fresh and immersive for me thumbs up from eldergamer1
early access reviewi like this game its fun playing with your friends and the new blue prints system to craft them instead of buying them with real life money is really good although some people might be dissapointed with the new pro pack but i still like this game
very fun game especially after update only problem i have is those â â â â ing huge gauntlets the characters use now they just dont look like something you could wear without hurting yourself in some fashion it just dont look right edits typos
good game there are dailys that take about twenty minutes so if you dont wanna play the game it doesnt take to long to complete on the other hand there are missions so if you wanna play even after your dailies you can f2p have good opportunities to win
i was excited for this game at first if i could just maybe just maybe find a name that isnt taken i mean come on mcshit is taken really really one thousand and ten would dreamworks game again
this game is broken ive never actually been able to play it even though i have tried to many times it will not let me sign with my linked google account and the website it takes me to if i ask to create a new account or to say i forgot my username has no functioning content to help
"my experience in tf2 how i see players with those hours1 hours40 hours ghastly gibus hat and pyrovision goggles f2p little kid yelling on everyone100hours after 100hours ask mom for ten buys four keys heard from some one about those unusual hats which cost sixty thousand, one hundred trying to open boxses and get 1hat one cosmetic item and one strange written in orange weapon and unique weapon at least is not a f2p noob now with repotion200hours after two hundred hours has many smelt refined metal first trading has just begun400hours have good and valuable inventory from trading600hours from trading makes very valuable items or spend little bit of money o not800hours ties to get unusual hat and spends two thousand and sixty or maybe someone not spend it those 20601600hours some people are rich with unusual hats and items inventroy overall two hundred or more some chance it to real life money some buy games someone got scamed and lost everythingbut what i can say about myself i played tf2 about seven hundred and thirteen hoursi spend only fifteen and i never had unusual hats but i had hats cosmetic items strange written in orange weapons i had valuable inventory and not one scams mei hate hackerscheats i hate teenagers and litte kids whos sending those phishing link tries to scam other players ing scamers i hate little kids whos yelling on servers and saying how are they slept with your mother in the bed and saying how call of duty and halo are better then tf29510 one of the best pc game of all time"
product received for freethis game crashes a lot why i have to admit this new epic loot update is great for the first hour or two if its your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumby ones you get the very first time you play the game though once you get over how amazing that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is youll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish especially since you have to buy premium to get half of whats in the crates anyways this crate system can be seen one of two ways either paytowin or getting on your knees and praying to the rng gods that once just once youd get an epic item from your protonium crate also heres a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone i found a stinkin legendary item in a bronze crate but i needed premium to have collected it the same thing happened to my friend but with a different item speaking of big guns they are litterally all you need to excel at this game i build a seven hundred and fifty pflop tank and it loses to some tiny bot ninety of which is a single gun seriously i could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship i guess not but who am i trash talk microbots i built one myself and i can get six kills in a single deathmatch with it most of the time building goes into where i should put more hoverblades finally this game crashes a lot though most of the time it seems to happen when i finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well what a coincedence20161216 edit its been a while and there have been many big changes to robocraft so i feel that my review could use an update too first off my thoughts on the fast and formidable update as a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts i enjoyed having the ability to build a two thousands pflop maximum value robot although quite a few robocraft veterans would disagree i think this update was a small step in the right direction i could build as i please but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot but this brawl update this brawl update is no fun freejam has decided to instead of listening to the community remove multiple game modes and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the brawl mode this would have been fine if they did it like overwatch and just added a brawl as a new game mode but no though at this point id be a fool to be surprised when freejam disappoints the community
i love smite it will forever to me be the most fun moba on the market game has a few small problems that can be fixed but will they hard to tell hirez needs to develop a way for people to understand how to play the game as a master conquest player this season peaking at fiftieth in the world ranking i understand this game more than anyone can hope to understand a game even in the highest level of games players still dont udnerstand fully what to do they need to pay people like me or other well known players to create videos teaching players how to actually play smite game has a great casual side matchmaking can be very poor at times because of lack of players at times hirez genuinely seems to be a good company other than minor slip ups stop promoting paladins and your card game those games are jokes and a waste of time and money smite is a gem and could become the next big thing will it though i see a bright future for smite but until this game is hirezs only focus time will be of the essance until this game dies out or is taken over by another action moba after having atleast two thousands hours on this game non steam hours are a thing this game will always have a place in my heart id recommend it to anyone who wants to try out the moba genre
early access review good graphics funny elements you are randomly spawned on the map players do not respawn in the same time game can be fun until you notice horrible aiming system impossible to shoot worst i ever seen in any game no real recoil just random jumping crosshair big minus nobody can play like this bad hit detection i shoot full round in the opponent headbody blood sprayhit effect is visible but somehow he survived and hit me once with axe i have full equippment dead happened more than once equippment does not have any effect probably because of bad hit detection people can kill you with one hit even when you have full protection and you can not kill basically naked guy with fifteen bullets installs legal technically malware gaijin agent most of people are not aware or even do not know what is malware but somehow this malware gaijin agent is universally accepted hell it even act as rootkit real question is why devs even need that malicious app when steam have good updater
early access reviewadventurequest 3d is a game based on the popular web browser game adventurequest world i am a long time player of artix entertainment since the first adventurequest athough most or should i say every single one their games are heavily money based paytowin type game and basically are just a grindfest i can still thoroughly enjoy their game i love on how the developer are really friendly and really in touch with their player and i can say that they are one of the best developer out there so yeah naturally i am excited when they announced that they are releasing aq3d i want to reccomend the game i really do this game looks promising since the first they announce this and i have a soft place in my heart for ae team but at this current state no i cannot recommend this they made little progress since the alpha state the controls are bad its just as clunky as ever gameplay are just boring and nothing really worthwile its basically just aqworlds to anyone who never played it its basically just a grindfest simulator made into 3d with clunkier control animation are terrible a lot of bug here and there occasional lag here and there and what not graphic are mediocre borderline bad to be honest at this current state this game is unplayable you didnt even make a significant progress since the alpha state mechanicwise you guys i mean the dev are way too focused on the content on how much equipment you could put into the game and seems like didnt really care about the gameplay mechanics the amount of content doesnt matter if you could even barely play the game its like a sea with million miles wide but an inches deep pros its adventure quest in 3dcons bad gameplay mechanics really clunky control a lot of bugs theres not much of a variation in gameplay its basically leftclicking simulator graphics are meh grindfest combined with clunky control its probably one of your worst nightmare ingame currency story are boringconclusion i cannot reccomend it to anyone because it is unplayable at its current state nor that i would actually recommend it to anyone even on the full release because their game is pretty exclusive as in i doubt that anyone could hardly enjoy it except if youve played their previous game which is why most if not all of the good reviewer here are their loyal fans theres not much to offer in this game except for heavy grinding and a lot of bugs the only content they could offer is just a hefty amount of equipment and thats all gameplay are not engaging quests are basicaly just a grindfest kill this deliver that get a sums of money and so on and the story is basically just a common herowhosavedtheworld trope i know you guys could do better than this i understand that this is still an early access but come on theres not much of an improvement since the alpha except for the content also asking for the players to spend money for in game currency in a nearly unplayable game is just insulting man
the new update ruined everything that made this game unique in the first place since day one it is now just another average iphone game for kids when it was such a decent source of soundtrack art and roleplaying experience with the elder scrolls universe bethesda bring back direwolf
early access reviewgreat game but there is a lot of bugs first of all shadows i can see where enemy sits inside building i just see its shadow from outside then when u use potions without unpress button potion will be lost and no effect of it and i think sounds is a little bit broken
trove is an alright game for those who like to grind it takes about three hundred hours for a f2p player to accually get anywhere near close to powerful servers can be a mess and break often but the community seems to be stable game is fairly well constructed with the expection of p2w factor that has let down the community overall its a meh game
first it was guns then it was hats now its well well okay its not strictly dead the playerbase is still quite strong but after more than eight years valve just doesnt know what to do with its game anymore and its been hemorrhaging experienced players its increasingly an empty shell in other words the meet your match update was the final straw it introduced matchmaking but only after more than a year of development and the release of overwatch the latest hugely popular cartoony multiplayer team fps and a game with great matchmaking tf2s matchmaking on the other hand came at the direct cost of quickplay and the repurposing of valvehosted servers which were the easiest and quickest way to get a guaranteed decent vanilla game anywhere in the world its also not very good matchmaking in either casual or competitive is slow to find you a game that often ends too fast in a curbstomp win by one of the teams and theres no autobalance or team switching allowed competitive copies the 6v6 format that is popular in the games competitive scene but then fails to enforce the class limits and weapon bans that made competitive play viable to begin with meanwhile casual matchmaking is too structured to replace the dropin dropout play you had with the server browser or the ease of quickplay while there are a couple of decent vanilla servers to be found not to mention plenty of modded servers in the server browser there is essentially no quick goto place for vanilla games anymore the update also fixed a bug with the righteous bison secondary weapon that was actually one of its key features when the weapon was originally released it was originally meant to penetrate and damage enemies multiple timesi redditmedia com which punished them for running away since it would hurt them even more it no longer does this also of note is that all of the medics mediguns now allow the medic to match the speed of their healing targets something that devalues the quickfix medigun even more since that was once a property exclusive to it these changes along with the other constant major balance changes indicate a team that doesnt really know their own game or at least the grounding for its historical decisions change is one thing but this is another my theory for why these things have happened is that developer turnover within the development team over the years has resulted in a team thats almost completely comprised of new blood as opposed to the original developers and their efforts to keep team fortress going have resulted in bloat and mismanagement i know they try i really do theyre not stupid and its not their fault their team is so small and underfunded by valve at this point though i dont know if theyll ever get the game back on track without a complete reassessment of priorities or a new team with a unified focus or a whole new game none of these are likely to happen tf2s updates have been in a slow decline for a while now theres been hundreds upon hundreds of new cosmetics new weapons new gamemodes and yet not much substance as good as the community contributions have been there is just too much now the constant release of workshop maps into the game itself even if some of them are very good and now the heavy vs pyro update seem more and more like the sputtering of a game that more experienced devs would have learned to leave well enough alone by now an endoflife phase tf2s contentfirst quantityoverquality mindset is dragging it deeper and deeper into its own muck sad to say the base game itself remains great if you ignore some of the more annoyingunbalanced weapons i would recommend arranging pickup games with friends for the foreseeable future if you want to play though if there were a mixed rating here i would now apply it to my mostplayed game of all time without a second thought
the only reason you would bother with a different ccg or tcg or whatever you want to call it is because this doesnt have two player friendly coop for 4man games like magic tg does seriously thats the only reason there is absolutely no other reason to play any other card game but this one it doesnt fck you at every turn for money its got good pacing its got complexity its aesthetically pleasing it allows for deck building in just about any way you want its system for breaking cards down and making new ones you actually want puts all others to shame so yeah i guess the only reason it doesnt have coop is because then no other ccg on the planet would ever be played anymore and theyre too nice to do that to everyone
ive always been a fan of card games but this one is very punishing to new players the short end of it is when you start the game everyone else has better cards than you and for the most part even if you outplay them and make good decisions their cards are just significantly stronger than yours so they outvalue what you have arena is okay because it takes most of this away but then again it seems like people get more legendaries and rares than you do in arena im almost level thirty and i still lose around seventy five of my games the only fair matches i seem to have are against new players like myself who dont have an extensive collection of cards i dont think this game is bad but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other players i also mostly play casual where i get matched up against people who have been playing for a very long time so that may be different than if i played ranked i love watching youtubers like cvh and justinlarson play this game and how creative they can be when crafting decks but then i realize that its ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when i have such a minimal collection maybe in time ill get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beating players whove been around for a long time but until then im going to continually lose all of my games unless im playing against new players or longtime players using trolly decks edit invested even more time into the game and its still paytowin after one hundred hours i still lose to everyone because they have better cards so frustrating
early access reviewi guess we shouldnt have expected anything from a game that has failed so many times before but to be met by brutal translation issues in the first five minutes was just the tip of the iceberg for this absolutely horrible excuse of a game dont buy it dont even try to defend it refund it if you got lured by all the false weve seen before launch
this game is terribly addictive but its also incredibly frustrating to start off in as many of the reviews say you get thrown into matches with tanks and airplanes with nothing but a basic rifle and get constantly oneshoted by campers with hightier gear with those on your team who could potentially clear these campers off doing exactly the same to the lowtier people on the other team if not for the totally unbalanced matchmaking i would give this game a thumbs up this way its a big nono
free to play without constantly being bugged with microtransactions overall it is a solid game and with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together i would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details give it a shot its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it
a massive mmo fps that makes battlefield look small lasers shotguns anything and everything if you like big fights of fifty vs fifty with tanks and jets then be sure to give it a try
this is a very fun game to play together with some friends it doesnt need that much storage you dont need the best computer and its really simple to get the hang of it you dont need to play this game two thousands hours before youre good at it its also free2play and thats just an advantage
early access reviewfor anyone looking at reviews for this game please note it is not malware this game is not malware in any way shape or form people saying it is are salty fortnite or pubg fans they disable comments and make there reveiw seem legit do not trust these fake reviews this game is really fun and a breath of fresh air from fortnite and pubg with some new mechanics if your looking to pick it up and are scared i repeat it is not maleware i would hate to this game die to false reviews p s some antiviruses report false positives so not all of them are fake they just kinda are three
talamoana warriorwere you too young to play diablo two in its prime didnt like being a beta tester for a console arpg do you think you are a lucky person hate blizzard have i got the game for you
ten 10every thirty four months a new update is released with a new league new mechanics some reworks always adding more late game content a lot to do in theorycraft terms and a lot of ways to have fun of course it has its meta but you dont need to follow it in order to have fun and make profit no p2w mtx more like pay to storage but you got four stash tabs at the beginning and you can get some stashes whenever they put em in sales pretty often tbhyou can both play it as softcore or hardcore player not talking about game modes but time spent on gameive played as many hours as you see and still not close to be tired
its pretty meh graphics are good for two thousand and fourteen game barely runs choppy as audio does not play in order of events man fall down five seconds later you hear man fall down story is meh and just kinda happens lots of load in issues when i go into the city i feel like i am playing on my old hp with five hundred and twelve mbs of ram going to stormwind overall its meh only worth playing now because its free there are better games out there
"seriously ok first off ads pop up every so often you even get single time offer things truly meant for five year olds why because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about sixty seven pointers for the devs one dont teach gamers stuff period2 free up the game a little bit give some freedom to the players of this game3 less ads and more of the the lore and freedom like before4 less offers to buy stuff for money i understand you want to make money and all but people who play video games hate ads and random popups that kill the gameplay5 i havent got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but free flying roaming like exploring berk while flying on your dragon summary its a great game but has olmost every aspect of a paytowin game if your kid or yourself is stuggling in prek fourth grade then this is the game for you but a fair warning if your child or yourself gets too attached to this game somehow get ready to lose all your money because its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending five thousand, six hundred and ninety nine to buy five hundred gems to get like six virtual dragons that last like six monthsnot reallybut its ok a little less than what i though it wasa little pathetic overall which makes it a below average game enjoy"
an enjoyable crafting game with interesting animals and some fun mechanics theres bugs yeah but its still all around enjoyable since leaving early access its still been getting steady updates bug fixes and new content all in all seems worth the time to try it
early access reviewimma go with the classics pros combat is fun and easy to pick up mass diversity in weapons characters and possible playstyles the game is well balanced awesome community constant updates and patches cons id love to be able to set my own video quality the game will run on pretty much anything doe overall excellent even if this is not your thing i really recommend you give it a shot
early access reviewthis game didnt lag even once while i played it looking at you pubg premium doesnt give you any advantage just clothing character customization is way better than it actually should be i mean you cant even see your face anyway but kudos for the nice touch in there different ways to move around the map and make you playstyle more awesome i guess you can be death from above with gliderwatch the shadows peeps extra fast moving from one spot to another with snowboard and climbing pack gives you an edge at the beginning of the match and you can literally be the hospital with two legs carry tonns of medpacks etc now for the dislikes cant shoot with smgs from snowboard and while climbing i heard that they will change that you can hear the steps of every1 from very far away annoying cant sneak around perhaps they should make another class that is slow without perks like glider etc but with muffled walking on medium settings some of the graphics glitch if you look at the trees and stuff sometimes flashes or textures move around doesnd bother much but still and last and least annoying thing all characters are asian not that i dislike asians but why limit it with only this option you can edit your dude or dudette to look half asian but thats about it cant deside about the get to tha choppa escaping i hate and like it at the same time people never cooperate but there is a chance that in the midst of chaos etc you can just slip through the opponents and win the match by smokebombing everything in all other aspects nothing surprising if you dont count that its free and it works more or less without flaws be sure to give it a try
a big mistake people make when they try this game is that they quit before the game even starts if you are willing to put some time into grinding through the base story assuming you dont enjoy the story six hundred and ten hours and learning about the layers of mechanics you will find your home in this game and developer the developers are super hard working innovative and they actually listen to their community with major content patches being released approximately every three months for free it is hard to see how any other game in the genre is able to compete if you enjoy arpgs and are looking for one with complex mechanics and endless character customization this is the perfect game did i mention its freeeeeeeeeeeee
really great game controls are easy to use or modify for personal style the textures are really nice and clean and the block selection is beautiful and ever growing the tech devices add so many options to decorate or even build with so many good things about this game especially the fact that it is free the pro key will be worth it to some but maybe not to others it adds some very useful and handy features that help with building bigger and crazier builds1010
early access reviewconnection issues aside this is a very generic mmo if you have previously played blade and soul black desert online aion or revelation online youve already played a much better game than bless go show your support there this game has a long ways to go before it catches up to any of those and its already been out for years
"while it may just be a mobile port it does make it easier on the pc vs the normal version it makes it easier on both the pc and the mobile device in my case a galaxy s6 and an a6 three thousand, six hundred and fifty for low spec systems this port aint half bad"
once upon a time i wouldve recommended this game to anyone even with its low amount of content the ability to build gave it incredible longevity much like a shallower minecraft with a decent little mmo tacked onto it but now it creeps further and further into armtwisting its playerbase into buying things or feeling left out their microtransaction system has transitioned from fun into extortion and i can no longer give this game a positive review
early access reviewlots of fun still early with this game but when fully developed damn squad or duo mode eventually would be great more armor means more noise its hilarious
the game is nice looking and so far the story is good but im not able to enjoy anything i do in the game i go from over one hundred fps down to twenty even ten every time i move no matter what graphics setting i put it on hope they do something about it i would like to play the game further but i just cant right now
the games was kinda fun at the start but when i started encountering higher level people with maxedout weapons and vehicles thats when things got out of hand its either you grind for hours to get a weapon or just win games with microtransactions its bad game design and developers should feel bad the fun part of the game is completely ruined by an inbalanced system
this game is fun if you like action rpgs play this if you liked diablo two play this if you like thinking about character progression and tactics play this if you like using your mouse wheel to change camera angle and zoom in from a birds eye view to a third person view of your character then we can be friends the gem system and sphere grid was a nice change from standard rpgs and i wish more was done with the bartering system make it more like fallout one two where you can barter item for item and not just for scroll scraps this is not a pay to win game but if you want to set up a guild expect to drop ten twenty dollars the only issue i experienced with this game was not from the game itself but from how i accessed it using steam the game was laggychoppy using the external client from their website game play was smooth still this game is a blast and even more fun with friends cannot recommend this enough and also it is free you can watch our first impressions of path of exile here https youtu be8b9hkh7zg
early access reviewwife and i bought the game unable to play together due to the fact if one of us is waiting in que the other gets stuck on the splash screen tested this quite extensively and the only work around seems to be playing on different regions than each other one thousand and ten would punch myself in the again
early access reviewthis game has strange customization you can ajust many face features but not the hair colour its really strange driving physics is kinda dull and most of the cars drives the same and this game has few items to costumize your character and even few items in premium shop but overall its really good for a free game i didnt across any lags of pingers and this is really important for this type of games

a game that could be good if it wasnt microtransaction hell this game has so many micro transactions and paytowin items its absurd reccomended for those with money to burn but not for a casual gamer such as myself three hundred and ten would not play again
i just downlaoded this game and played it for a little while here are my thoughts one this game is not optimized just even seeing the game first hand i can tell its not optimized and also it is unplayable right from the start2 the combat is very slugish not really something that is ready for release this should still be in alpha3 the cutscenes were absolutely horrid they are unwatchable to the point where you want to skip them they lag your pc really badly worse then blackdesert did back when it came out4 even the flying from place to place it was not enjoyable i would reather have a loading screen this is my first thoughts on this game it really should not have came out of alpha it had so much going for it now i get that not every game really lives up to the hype but in my experience this game had a lot going for it if the deves really want to try again i am willing to wait for a new game from them or even fixes to this game i do know its impossible to wish for but from what i have heard there is nothing good going on with the game or even the devs them self people ask for refunds of the game and dont get even a responce on top of that comments on steam would just disappear now before anyone wishes to jump on me for giving this a bad review please do understand that i do know that games take a long time to make and i fully understand it takes time for things to be fixed if neowiz really wishes to make this a better experince they need to fix the massive problems that it has putting it to fee to play will not fix it it will just make it worse
three hundred hours of agony later i am writing this review on a horrible pay to win game first game i play in about a month i get shot from across the map in my spawn by a rocket do not make the grave mistake of spending any money on this game like i did becuase you will be greeted with ticks sniping every game from a mountain top across the map using ultra low graphics only absolute should play this game because theyre the only people who get kills bad game
i have no clue why people say war thunder is bad in my opinion its the best free game out there people are really stupid to stay that the grind is long lets say you want to get soviet jets and your saying its too long your best is about tier two aircraft the thing is just use a premium aircraft or premium account yes you can get premium for free unlike world of tanks where premium vehicles cost really money or gold to convert xp for vehicles in war thunder its not like that if you have a premium vehicle you get 2x of lions and xp just research the aircraft you wanttanks and it will be 2x faster have premium and its 3x faster sure you can spend a little to get your grind fast but there is also boosters that you get all the time my point is people who say the grind is long they are pure idiots and people who keep saying they get overtired and they always lose its because they dont know how to use their vehicle properly in war thunder you need practice and use everything you haveboosters premium account to their full advantage and you will surely get that vehicle you always wanted
early access reviewso i started playing this game on the twentyfourth of april two thousand and sixteen it was great the robot ranks ensured i only fought against people in a similer level to me and it was fun there was a pay to win element but it was mostly unintrusive as you earned money from battling which you could use to buy the the things you wanted for you bot from a store it was good sadly this is not the case any more as of todays twentyeighth of april patch the only reliable way to obtain the items you want is to pay for currency and buy them instead of being awaded cash to buy items at the end of a round you are now given crates on completetion of a battle which contain random mostly crappy items there is no more robot ranking and you will quite often be matched with people that are so far beyond your level that you might aswell just not respawn you can still buy the things you want for you bot but to get the money to do that you have to scrap the random crappy parts that it gives you from crates but the scrap value of those parts is so low as to be almost not even worth it really the only way to reliably obtain a specific item now is to pay rl money for a bunch of high end crates so you can scrap them for the money to buy the thing you want avoid this game until the devs tone back the bullfunk pay to win unbalanced shatfest that it is now
early access reviewthis game is based like csgo thats because of the weapons and because of the settings i even named it csgo version two but still its free and very descent so play this game instead of csgo because its free bye it was иeonwallha kz if u want to play csgo or warmode text me
ive been playing smite on and off for a while now im not in to mobas at all but smite feels like something else its another one of those easy to learn hard to master games as mentioned by a lot of other people the camera angle is great and all the maps are fantastic extremely fun game and a very balanced free to play the extra twenty on the gods collection is fantastic value and a great way to give back to a great dev team
early access reviewthis game has been adding on lots of content before the release the content gets better as you go on and from what ive read they are going back to the beginning to redo those zones to make them more fun and less grindy as well fun game and love that i can play on my computer and pick up on my phone when i am out bored somewhere
this game can be severely confusing at times but overall its a pretty good game ive had it for a couple days its pretty easy to complete story quests but standard quests potentially take a bit of time the startup packs are quite helpful as you level up but im sure after level forty its a bit more difficult without the free packs anyways i recommend it to everyone and if you need to know how to turn on sound effects let me know lol
after 2069h playing i still hate mobas cons servers sucks community sucks after every patch you can see huges bugs theyre just like another teammate you eventually learn to love them pros all the gods are broken here thats balanced third person moba nice characters concept based on mythologies different game modeswarning addictive as almost all the mobas server really sucks do something with the servers accidently reviewedwas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful either way join this group for more free keys and reviews weekly steam group accidentlyreviewed
this game is unbelievable and omfg i love this game to death like i want to play it two hundred and forty seven but i have school and this computer im use in really not meant for gaming but i wish i can have a great computer and i highly recommend this game to other people who are a rpgmmoboth player
it would be a solid air combat simulator however the fact that this game is tagged as free to play just triggers me you cant do ninety nine of the things in the game without paying this is just ridiculous if you are going to make me pay for all the planes in the game why not just put a price to the game itself oh right because this way the developers can charge up to sixty for a single module the witcher three is cheaper than that and it is a whole game charging sixty for a single plane is just the dirtiest paytowin i have ever seen in my entire life ten
best game to play with friends you can ruin them emotionally and financially you will probably lose a friend playing this game honestly this game has more salty players then lol and csgo combined i always winso big up to this game
load up this gameplay the most epic song i can think of at the timechoose my nc characterheavy assault just the way i like itjoin the great canyons of indarnotice a zerg coming my waythe song is at the most epic partlets rock
if i were you i would download it for your smartphone because if you get addicted phone version will be always with you you cannot merge accounts you can however move saves between devices which would get way too annoying everytime well this game is basically inbread simulator a singleplayer paytowin hearthstone with quests and rng naming your dwellers really weird names and reviving a thirty days dead guy after you forget about him recomnened to play when you have nothing to do between other things as you just basically wait between outputs which brings no fun and minimal progress to the table i have three high stat females that i use to breed with the legendary male i got out of a lunch box whenever he gets back from the wasteland
i have been playing this game since two thousand and thirteen before it was on steam so steam probably shows no time played first off the game is decent it can be fun at times and there are plenty of vehicles to use i will acknowledge it does have some good aspects but sadly the bad outweighs the good first off the mods are people who are being paid by gaijin to ensure nothing bad is ever said about the game if you even mention something about the game in either the chat or the forums you will get banned the mods do not warn and do not give any reasons for it they just claim you verbally abused them while they just do nothing about people actually throwing out racial slurs and other actual verbal abuse so do not play this game if you want to be able to talk openly about it the other major problem is that gaijin never fixes anything there have been issues with the game people have been asking to be fixed since twenty thirteens and they have still never even been looked at but then again with how the mods always ban everyone for mentioning there is a problem with the game that may be why they also continually change aspects of the game that are for no other purpose than potentially getting more money from people
an amazing sim with a powerful flight model that is aging well constant updates and third party development keeps this game relevant for years now however graphics optiumization has taken a serious backseat i have a powerful rig with gtx ten eightys and i cant even get it to run smooth in vr 2d monitor is buttery smooth mission and campaign editor is a powerful and complex tool making replayability a grand adventure however due to the fact that aircraft may come from different developers the quality for each aircraft varies i have since bought the mig21bis fc3 a10 and combined arms addon packs on sale and i have come to realize the sheer amount of quality research done on the flight model and avionics to make this game shine going to military aviation conventions and bookstores i have bought books from the 60s 70s 80s and 90s on some of these aircraft and the information is valid and relevant the free aircraft su25t is a great aircraft to learn in and is still my goto primary plane it teaches you to be conservative with the controls and gives wide range of targets and attack methods to hit its also well armored and surprisingly fast in a level dive runin so you can take some flak before having to rtb dcs world is the best allaround modern combat flight sim in my opinion at this time any improvements they make are just additions to this fact i have tons of fun in il2 battle of stalingrad and im not sure how the ww2 aircraft in dcs compare in realism to that as i do not own those modules when speaking to my uncle who is a jet pilot he explained that the engine control is reasonably simplified and automated ingame as most people dont have enough buttons on their keyboard and flight stick for that task but besides this fact it is modeled very close to the real thing and a person practicing procedure in dcs could learn to fly the aircraft fairly quickly with a training program the sim in general has an issue with scale speeds and distance are scaled down and vehicle models scaled up to create and illusion of a larger playable space and save on processing power he noticed it during takeoff as passing runway objects appeared to be moving too slowly relative to aircraft speed and it is a subtle factor to the game to improve performance
early access reviewthis was one of few free games that i supported by spending some money while money could bring you some bonus xp and cosmetics but now its turning into a cheap cash grab it lost its direction when it tried to become a moba and every further update takes it away from fun game and turns it into a p2w mess
it has some issues because of the new client but it looks really good now some cards looks blurry animation is little bit weird but they can fix these issues old version was like from two thousand and ten gameplay is still good better than hearthstone
early access reviewokay this game is great its free to play and still and early access game and allready hase more content then pubg the end game is the best i love getting to the heli
early access reviewdo not play this game it looks fun and it is but admins go to their servers and give people viruses on their computer this game seems to be just a big phinishing job
i dont mind this game being pay to play i mean come on guys them developers gotta eat or feed their families yo also its not a competetive game well it did a mode like that but thats not what this game aim to be which you need to pay to get better equipment in order to win i suggest buying this game when its on fifty off sale like me the full experence is worth paying i think of it as the worlds most detailed ebook about firearm one thing i dont like about this game is that the shooting range mode sucks the sound is low quality and weak animations are clunky and overall feel of the firearm dosent feel convincing
early access reviewok first time ever typing a review but holy smokes this game for an early access game holy i had so much fun cant wait to play this with my friends trust me its got its small bugs and what not but man oh man its free just download it try it you have my word this game is dope huge thumbs up from me loved it
early access reviewso i played this game quite alot when it originally came out in early access and i thought it was great it was a innovative take on the battle royale genre and me and my friends had a great time playing it i didnt play it for several months not because it was bad but because there where other releases that i wanted to try out aswell today the twentieth november i played it once again only to discover that there are now bots in the game bots in a battle royale game destroys the whole concept i would rather have long queue times and met actual human players than get fast queues where only twenty of the enemies you face are actual players if a two minute queue gets me twenty humans and eighty bots wouldnt a ten minute queue get me a full map of only human players i dont really see the reasoning behind the bots if not to cover up long queue times you will notice the bots right away the ai is really poor and they struggle with stairs walls and always run in a straight line making them really easy targets to hit this is really sad this game was really fun and i like the changes they have made during early access even though i think the drastic changes every week was what made people stop playing it but adding bots is a sure way to kill the player base if it wasnt for the bots i would have probably played this for a few weeks now with my friends switch games for a couple of weeks and then return and continue to do so for a long time but with bots in the picture i dont see myself coming back to this ever again
three hundred hours pumped into this game but now im never going to play it again unless they remove this patch that is i really dont understand these cancerous developers they were making progress on trove making the servers betteradding tons of new content weekly and then they decide to make the game complete garbage by putting in even more p2w or pay to not grind for hours and hours maybe even days this patch is pretty good for players that have everything but this patch is horrible for new players because youre going to have to grind for atleast a good couple hours maybe even a day or two or you can pay money about ten
early access reviewafter playing through all of the game thats finished so far i must say im very impressed considering that the game is not only unfinished but also free its a very enjoyable experience i would reccommend to anyone else im not usually a fan of horror games but this one really pulled me in with its self parody and clever references the game starts out very cute and innocent the first enemies in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall as the game progresses and more serious and deadly monsters join in you reach a point where you are so on edge that even the cutouts make you jump i would absolutely encourage anyone else to pick this up for a few hours of scarycute fun
the goodteam fortress two is not your ordinary game focusing on its cartoony graphics offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes but it will definitely put some people off if youre a person who likes teambased multiplayer firstpersonshooter video games i think this game is for you the sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals its a perfect game you are always updated with new incredible releases last but not very least a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play the greatthe game can be addictive and challenging if you let it the game is very fun with different characters and balanced one of the best games of all time for sure people who call this game or boring dont know much about shooters to be honest each class is a really funny cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality youre not running around with an ak47 or m16 but with syringe guns and sticky bombs its quite hilarious not to mention its great itemdrop system an amazing fanbase and the community they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game the uglythere is no serious gameplay whatsoever if the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay they would have made an ingame system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends face the facts you can disconnect the current game any time you like even in mvm matches perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players gameplaymost team fortress two game modes have two opposing teams the reliable excavation demolition red and the builders league united blu that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives some game modes include capture the flag each team attempts to steal the opposing team s intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base king of the hill a central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round payload one team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base team deathmatch a team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team charactersthe players on each team must choose a class to play each with their own set of abilities and special weapons medic heals fellow teammates with a medigun that can übercharged to make other players temporarily invincible scout runs very fast and is able to double jump the scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat heavy weapons guy also known as just heavy this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes he wields a minigun and boxing gloves and can recover health by eating sandwiches pyro wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close engineer can build teleporters sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle sniper can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head demoman wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners or lay traps for enemies to run into soldier a rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground spy can disguise themselves as members of the other team and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back can sap engineer s buildings to quickly destroy them
early access reviewawesome platform fighter for the low low low price of free characters are balanced and viable thanks to the weapons system tons of fun locally and online this is the game that i wish smash four was
product received for freegot bored after i levelled up essentially got a few kills on people in the first game mode who have no idea how to play and boom i was teleported to a high level war in which p2w players and grinders insta kill you and blow you up in tanks or planes and all i had to show for it was some semi auto rifle which did cheese all against their guns would have more hours if not for this better with friends
early access reviewgame runs very well on my phone and tablet which i have played the majority of hours on even my 4inch phone is easily playable due to clever interface design the game is also synchronized between your devices and steam account presentation artwork and progressioncard collection are derivative of hearthstone what this means if you never heard of hearthstone is that the cards animate themselves on the game board so its easy to tell what their doing attacking creatures smack the enemies flying creatures hovering spells shooting across the battlefield not much is left to imagination as would be the case in physical card games which helps new players keep track of whats going on card artwork skews toward cartoony but not in a childish way admittedly im not a fan but thats personal taste players earn cards through gameplay or opening packs but cannot trade with other players at the time of this review the first pvp win of the day rewards a pack of cards this is an extremely generous way for players to complete their collection of common and uncommon cards with minimal grind rares and legendaries will still require grinding or the gameplay itself is derivative of mtg so expect 5color playing resources defender choosing who blocks and instant spells on opponents turn there are many keywords that take advantage of the digital space like warcry and echo eternal features pve modes but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until youre ready to pvp im giving this game a thumbs up because easy pick up and play wellpolished presentation strong support for mobile devices room for complexity and growthnow for the issuesmany players complain about the mtg style resource system that causes some games to be unplayble due to not drawing enough or too many resources the mulligan system and certain cards try to mitigate this but it is still there expect power screw but no worse than mtg75 card minimum deck reduces consistency this can cause deck building to lean toward high quality cards that are strong regardless of the deck instead of weaker cards that better synergize with the deckthere is also a massive power disparity between legendary cards and uncommoncommons these two points may be how direwolf plans to players towards legendaries and how they can practically give away requires an internet connection to play even to pve or tinker with decks
fun game one of the things that sets this game apart in my mind is the ease and simplicity of creating decks and editing decks in a painless process it is very fast and the cards are displayed very well in large format so you can read their skillsabilities without having to click a lot of crap deal with popups and load times and bugs the only thing id really like to see implemented into the game is an option to turn off screen shake i really hate my visual shaking all over the place it gives me a headache and i have to look away from the screen id like to see an option available to disable the rumble like many other games have
this game is really boring as soon as you start the game you are told to go through one thousands rooms it only feels like i went through about twenty rooms because most of the time you will be walking throught the same repeated rooms over and over again to the point where you give up because its so boring the game looks like a world i could build in minecraft every time you make it through fifty rooms youre greeted with a elavator which takes you down to the next floor below where the whole ing process starts all over again its really boring oh did i forget to mention the lame jumpscares that sound like my two year old sister being tickled oh yeah once every one hundred floors has an enemy in which you just gotta run away from thats most probably the only fun thing about this game you see an enemy run fast through about eight rooms which will repeat untill the enemy randomly disapears then youre back to walking though the same boring rooms again sounds fantastic doesnt it this game is free which is a good thing but dont waste your time playing it unless youre really bored
early access review ressources system i thought that was not possible to be more random than hs but this game proved me this could if you want to play this game prepare to put your brain off skill isnt required at all but dont worry if you want to increase you luck you can use your credit card to buy some extra broken legendary and have more chance to win games
i i cant begin to describe how i feel what i feel is that tf2 is dying its hard to admit i still love it but the telltale signs are everywhere youtubers leaving and hell shibby is basically a freaking battlefield four youtuber now like seriously what did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed tf2 was great it still is its one of the most unique and innovative games and well its dying nothing lasts forever tf2 has been around for nineteen ish years and theres only a certain point to something you start with a sketch you expand on it draw lines all over the paper fill in the gaps but eventually your run out of space i hate to see a wonderful game die but more and more actual servers empty and more and more people go to trade idle and vsh servers the game slowly kills itself is tf2 still the third most played game hell yeah but so many of those people are congaing or bartering over unusuals and not playing the game is it the communities fault no a poor reflection of valves contribution and what just soldified the joke that valve used to make games now they make money is the end of the line update a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hasnt been seen in so long a finished map not ing operation hole bound beta or tile texture rd but a real somewhat new gamemode but valve took it out because it was too confusing they dont add weapons only cosmetics and a ing cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks i would hate to see tf2 die because so many people are invested if tf2 dies so does the market the ten thousand dollar spender who bought the burning ke smissmass was okay new weapons yay but once again valve seems to be trying to please us with half finished ideas with mannpower theyve brought too much beta and we the people would much rather see a finished and drawn out map rather than a overpowered attempt at pleasing the people i dont hate tf2 i hate whatever the cause may be for this wonderful deviation from the rehashed ing military shooters like hardline and advanced warfare just please valve as great as community effort might be it seems like your not trying please make it like the good ol days where youd introduce a polished custom map that is valve standards every update we have enough hats and festives we need weapons and maps and gamemodes and anything but this just please ive gone through two game deaths in my gamer career they were fun on the last days moderators giving out planned items it was amazing but then they ended and although you think youll be fine you sometimes wake up and go to your computer and open up steam only to remember that your favorite game is gone please dont leave the ones who love this in the dust just focus on this game and give it some love
game is eighty great tracks are polished game play is very good what is realy lacks is damage modeling nascar two thousand and threes showed the world what could be done in two thousand and threes and now sixteen years later and this title cant do any better the geat real mode is not realy real does anyone coding watch real races i will give you five thousand to get bit right yes sixteen years later and no one cand do damage models licencing i read somewhere get a good layer
counterstrike robo offensiveno one likes these damn crates its a cheap paytowin method of sucking the fun out of people who are reluctant to fling their wallets at freejam backwards evolution somehow this game seemed to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throwing every player they can find into matches overpowered weapons no one asked forit feels like freejam procrastinated so long they forgot they had to make an update so they just decide to throw in a new poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress removal of mega botsi see no real reason why this was even done its as if they removed them without knowing why they wanted to or what they were going to do from there craftingthis isnt an update freejam literally just replaced the word in the code this couldve been done by anyone who has even taken coding classes in high school again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around cluelessly trying to figure out why the popularity of robocraft is dropping faster than stock prices on black thursday removal of armored blocksagain no clue what they were going for here it was fair and balanced pretty much a major factor in what made robocraft unique it seems like a good third of my grinding in robocraft was to get better armored blocks and there they go wiping days of effort its just too complicated for its own goodand not in a good way you can jam all kinds of new content into your game faster than ever before but that wont make it any better if you dont slow down and put time and effort into it sht plus sht just equals bigger sht removal on limitations of gun typesletting every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time removes most if not all diversity in robots all creativity and design in my opinion that was most of the things the community doesnt like about this game its very simple to find out what they dont like as several people have done the very same thing i just did statement from freejamfreejam has recently announced that they would be partially fixing some of these issues such as the crates and tiers they have even stated they want to remove all ways to buy parts with real money this is the first positive thing they want to add to robocraft in a long time if robocraft holds true on their plans i will be more than happy to change my reccomendation for this game
one of the worst games i have played if its not taking thirty actual seconds to do one action in eye your getting matched up with people that are far too op to ever be called fair and hay lets not give you a passwordd system becuse we put numbers on our cards for no good reason
product received for freeearly access reviewclasses abilityies guns good graphics crafting battle royale and free to play to sum up everything for a good battle royale game
well i used to love tf2 but this new update is some people have been waiting two hours just to play a casual game oh and theres penaltys for leaving now please give us back the old tf2
early access reviewas a fan of artix entertainment i do believe that aq3d has potential but if you were to ask me how i would rate this currently id give it a two hundred and ten the graphics for this game are atrocious for a game that started development as recent as it did adventurequest worlds aq complaynow or even adventurequest battleon com provide a far better gameplay experience than this as much as this feels like there is effort being put into it i think this is simply one more thing that will draw attention away from other games that artix entertainment has produced similar as to what adeventurequest worlds has done to adventurequest although both are updated regularly adeventurequest worlds has received much more attention over recent years im glad that ae is expanding into 3d game development but i honestly dont feel that adenturequest 3d will or should survive furthermore i feel that aq3d feels more pseudo3d rather than an actual 3d title the movement is clunky as well as the viewing the game overall isnt worth your installation
sometimes a lot of time you just get screwed by bad rng draws you get stuck at two to three power while your opponent draws just what they need or you draw five or six power cards in a row screwing you over its simply not fun to play when you have no control over if you draw enough power cards to play your other cards
early access reviewthe overall gameplay is enyjoyable and the quirky cooking theme is unique despite my former statement this game is very unfair and dull for the majority of the game allow me to explain to preface this is only from my experience if you want to play give it a try i understand the fact that battle royales have rng luck plays a roll in your success in cuisine royales case though i feel like its too random seven out of ten games i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope other games i will spawn in a decent location and ill end up looting six houses and leaving the area with a c96 pistol with eight bullets and a pot on my head the games dull for the most part due to the fact that for ninety of the â â â â ing game you dont engage with anyone and dont even get me started on the gun play the accuracy of weapons in this game are atrocious largley due to bullet bloom i do not understand why some developers add bloom as a game mechanic but its â â â â â â â â it destroys the majority of skill that goes into aiming your weapons and it makes fire fights for the majority of the time down to luck due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapons with the exeptions of the mg forty two and the ppsh and a few others which leads to tough late games when you are lucky enough to have regular engagements in the game in my opinion it rewards hiding instead of engaging the weapon damage seems inconsistant as well some times i will put fifteen bullets into someone and they wont drop and ill end up losing the engagment 0ther times ill completely rip open the guy in like three bullets i realize that there are most likely hit multipliers but nobody should need to be hit fifteen consecutive times to die its glitchy as well i was playing duos with a friends and we were going to win the game but instead the game decided to clip him into the military fort that he was standing on when he went prone ontop of it ultimitely trapping him and killing him this game has a lot of potential i know its in early access i will keep playing and i will rereview this game if the developers fix issues and are proactive in the community looking forward the accessory mechanic was a very good addition and makes the game unique compared to other battle royales darkflow studios even though this was an april fools joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular optimistic for the futurei still recommended this game since it is fun but its broken in a lot of aspects i wanted to address them while giving my take on this game and thoughts for the future
"i like this game and played it a lot on google chrome i recently got it on steam and have had a huge reminder of how hard it is to really have fun without making micro transactions lots of grinding is needed to advance further in the game but the multiplayer is fun its free to play so dont expect anything amazing unless youre willing to pay perfect to pass time seven thousand, five hundred and ten"
early access reviewfun and silly lovely graphics and i can run it on my potato pc so the optimization isnt that bad at all i look forward to possible further development of this game
early access reviewso far this game is amazing would recommend there is just one major issue i get when i que for a second game after the first one that makes my pc go â â â â â â â and bluescreen after a while with the error message thread stuck in device driver
i played this hame before so i decided to redownload it and this is what happens when i tried to run it pc crash one your computer has run into a problem so it restarted pc crash two my entire pc froze and i had to hold the power button to restart it when it did i struggled to get my wifi back online then a friend of mine tells me the same thing happened to him when he tried to play the steam version of the game and he says his computer crashed too i dont know what the problem is and i really enjoyed the game but i just know one thing im never even going to try and launch it again id rater not risk it
"i told myself id never play let alone look at the game but that was unavoidable i turned around days later playing the game thought itd be boring few minutes later i get addicted and it is slowly destroying my social life reccomend to people who want to destroy their social lives hear eight hundred moans and them calling you namesinsults in japanese six thousand, nine hundred and ten would fap again"
this use to be on of my favorite mmosthen they updated now its literally one of the worst mmos ive ever played do not spend money on this game many people did before the update and now the gear they bought with that money is junk because of the new update quite frankly this game is no longer what it was and is not worth spending any time on or spending money on
early access reviewi normally never post a comment on games but this game is so fun and very competetive it been a long time since i played a game with so good input lag and responsive movement very awesome game i recommend it
early access reviewi like to think of this game as a sequel to the previous games which were 2d and somewhat fun i guess and now that its 3d with decent graphics i think i started to like this franchise once more to be honest the graphics arent the best but theyre not the worst around and i can play anything as long as the graphics dont hurt my eyes gameplay is good but i think the cutscenes could take some work and a little more animation besides that everything is fine they could make the action bar something similar to the one from aqw for the pc version because right now it feels like i am playing a mobile game they should make xp a little easier to get too just my opinion keep up the good work
early access reviewan interesting and quirky experience for me almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next of which there are one thousand some short and straighforward some longer and more complex but all being a few seconds long at most occasionally youll be chased by monsters which despite coming in many variations almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to because of these characteristics the game feels like a very long chase sequence and with one thousands rooms to be overcome before the game is over it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game clocking at around three hours for completion fortunately there are save spots every fifty later one hundred rooms which allows the player to take a break if necessary difficultywise its not hard almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle and its entirely possible youll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms however the game leaves little room for error as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even onehit kill you if they manage to get in close enough it all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door in regards to atmosphere its a blend of humorcuteness with horror which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots the humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue which are peppered throughout the gameplay but become increasingly rarer the horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds most of them from the monsters that chase you and i didnt find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor so i believe the game was successful in its atmosphere in my opinion that is the highest point of this game seeing what monsters environments and dialogue will come next all in all if youre a fan of horror games id say give this at least a try its different and has a charm to it that i believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique
early access 3d brings back the rivotting memories of my childhood one hundred and one thousand and eleven i appreciate the 15mg install as it only took one second best game ever 2k16
early access reviewamazing game so far only one thing i dislike about solo is that when you kill an enemy they become a chicken in which they can run away and get selfrevived after a time limit of course like come on dude i already killed this guy why do i have to kill him in chicken form to get his stuff it just wastes time i like the idea of unique classes and abilities and that other classes cannot use a different class ability also that in order to get lengendary items class weapons abilities you have to go to a forge there are multiple forges on map in which can end up being a bloodbath because everone will want to go to the forges to craft stuff how do you craft stuff you collect shards by destroying duplicates or basically every weapon armor abilities dropped by other players in other words i already love this game and only have like fortyeight minutes on it this is my dream game ive always wanted a medieval battle royale or at least something close to it this is fantasy battle royale there are still guns but they are like muskets
it def is a good game there are a few things that are a bit buggy but other than that its a very fun and lemme say time consuming game three diff game modes and they all are slighty tweaked to diff from one another my personal favorite game mode is survival its actually pretty tough i would add vehicles to normal servers on open world though i really hate having to run everywhere i go or pay my hard earned zombie killing cash to take one trip across the map like i said few fixes the game would be pure gold
truley amazing game not played alot of it but for what i have played tis an absolute marvel would like to see jets like the fgr4 typhoon and the hawker hurrican aswell as the spitfire please be in the developers to do list for the not so distant future
product received for free after playing this game for two years i sadly must give it a poor review although lets keep it in perspective it is a free game with options to pay for upgrades so is it really free then i have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes blah blah blah try the ones you like dont drive the ones you dont like move on so my complaints arent about the game when it works the key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows one war thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer and continues to date which drives my maleware detector crazy why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me my question is this why would steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site two war thunder sends out daily downloads is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates really i understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day come on three the straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the war thunder server i checked my own settings to ensure it wasnt on my side and it wasnt but after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects it has finally driven me away from war thunder the moral of the story is this you get what you pay for if free game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isnt really free oh and by the way yes i did pay for golden eagles to improve my upgrade performance so it wasnt really free for me
overall pretty good game for a card game similar to hearthstone but based off the elder scrolls world so if you know that world better than wow this might be the game for you the pve side of it is pretty good as well provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you dont want to thanks to the pve arena biggest downfall which i very dislike you cant create the cards that are in special bundles so of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game the reason i want to highlight this out is because they have a description for the madhouse bundle stating weve added some cards thatll really help balance out certain decks and help the game but you have to pay ten just to get a bundle of cards regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help maintane a competive advantage with exclusiveop cards the games fun in its simple form also im sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said op cards i give the game total a six hundred and ten due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap cuz revenue is always better than player experience we all know how the business world works if your ok with spending money on digital cards the game deserves eight hundred and ten for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games this last paragraph is edited as necrophagist pointed out u can use your ingame gold to purchase said content above which is a good alternative it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content so ive decided to change the total rating to seven hundred and ten due to that alternative
if you like sword art online this is the game for you the finest mmorpg since blizzard made sword art online it inconporates the best mechanics from every moba and mmorpg to exist including animation canceling great cgi cutscenes character development and the plot line is unique in itself offfering a variety of routes i would say the plot is on par with the star wars triolgy in addition there are many waifus to be had and captured almost like pokémon you capture the cute grills like you would tame a beast monster on wow the game also has a vast array of spells keeping the game fast pace and complex with countless animations going on during battle1010 would pay again
this game is the best free to play game ever in the planet fun and with good rewardsextra fun if u play with friends i recommend it to all of you the rank i am going to give to that game is unusually one of the best p1010 would play again with more friends and enjoy it all the time
dont play this gamelook this isnt a bad game but for the love of god dont play it its all afk you just let it play by itself you think if you wait a few hours and let it idle youll have money to level up and progress nope youll get enough money to take you for a few levels but because the levels and items get more expensive as you level up the money goes away really quickly but hey thats not a problem you can just pay for money idles and chests right that brings me to problem number two its pretty much all pay to win they know it takes forever to level up by idling they know its time consuming and youll ultimately get nowhere they want it that way so that you spend money on microtransactions and dlc as a disclaimer i got the dlc i have for free and let me tell you i would never pay real money for it the dlc is basically worthless you get items that arent even useful until waaay later into the game problem number three the idles you get so far in the game and you can reset which you get rewarded with idles but youll get very few id be suprised if you get over twenty doesnt seem like too much of a problem right wrong it takes hundreds of idles to get the upgrades for them so you have to sink hours and hours into the game to even get there they want you to pay for the microtransactions however in the end this all comes down to personal preference if youre a fan of in my opinion wasting your money by playing a completely pay to win game go right a head i wouldnt recommend it ive sunk many hours into and ive only been able to reset once and got twelve idles not worth the time or the electricity to play avoid it please
the game is so unbalanced hirez needs to nerf that samedi cause he literally breaks the game please fix that ultimate cause more and more people are lefting the smite cause of its ridicolously unbalanced gods and crappy matchmaking the game is not funny animore hirez start paying attention to your community or this game will die soon
it is a decent game for people that like guns or that are gun enthuasists the game gives you the ability to know the inside of a gun very well by challenging you to put the pieces together the right way i also recommend to anybody who wants to know a little bit more about guns
early access reviewthis game is basically magic the gathering given the hearthstone ui treatment and legendaries that break the game downside is that probably eighty of my games have those 1inamillion power draw rates like getting ten sigils in the top fifteen cards or getting two sigils in the top twenty cards things that should happen occasionally but should not be happening with anywhere near the regularity that they do its probably the number one thing that kills my enjoyment of the game the games free to play model is pretty generous but you will be absolutely destroyed by certain legendary cards that are so rare the only effective means of obtaining them is buying the large boxes that guarantee their drop rates is it worth it i dont know its definitely got deeper strategy than hearthstone but keeps hearthstones problem of one card making or breaking a game if you lack immediate removal its also much harder to narrow down a strategy like you can in magic thanks to the high power and high card limit requirements
early access reviewas a person who hates pubg this game offers same bullsheet as other battle royal games ill give a try once a real triple a company makes a battle royal for now i suggest grab a free copy of this game while its free and delete it forever
looks cool the dragon babies ar cute but i was really fighting with the controlls and therefore rapidly lost interest also as fist time player the tutorial should explaine what to doe i was attanding flight class and had absolutly no idea how to fly until i used ever key on my keyboard until i foundt the right one pitty
uninstalled on my second day of playing ive already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pros this mmo combat flight sim started out fun for me ive played a good number of combat flight sims both realistic and arcadeish so im pretty experienced with them this one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with when i first got started i was flying a late wwi era plane and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches most if not all of us were newbies at this game at first it was fun and challenging and i found myself consistently ranking in the top two or three spot on my team this mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sims but after i reached level three i started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks that is the veteran players of this game and it got unfun real fast at third and fourth leveli found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level two thousand and forty players not only were these players way more experienced with the game than i was their planes were way better too i would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky little 762mm machineguns trying to whittle them down while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons
early access reviewgame looks great but if you try to play in the ranked mode i have to play against silver three players as a bronze three player why cannot i play against oter bronze three players so i loose almost every game sure i can get free cards from the practice games but it will take months to get better cards unless you spend a lot of money of course
i remeber seeing this game on youtube somewhere and thinking to my self man i wonder how much thisll cost to my surprise i find out that the game is free i went stright to the home page and waited for the download once it finished i played it nonstop now that ihave steam i can now start back at square one and enjoy the game as if it was my first time ever
while fun at first this game has become unplayable in higher tier games due to recent changes its been a steady decline and ive tried to push through it but enough is enough dont bother save yourself from insanity
this game is really complex and complete really fun to explore the different ways to play it a lot of people claim that its a pay to win but i assure you that if you know how you can play this game without having to pay for anything sure you can pay to make it easier but if you for example save enough ingame money to buy yourself vip for one month youll then become rich in no time xd
this game was the reason that i first created my steam account after seeing friends play it and wanting to play with them the game plays well and even with the horrible specs of my computer i can run it on max graphic settings the majority of the time its a ton of fun even if all youre doing is sprintjumping in a straight line backandforth across the world in order to get rid of the clouds on the map
some features i like in this game are how the game can be played in an either independent or team dependent base way andor team base with unlock able weapons taunts cosmeticsitems among other things though people joke about this game and how op some set ups are or how meta some items are or how much their hat is worthhatfortress2 in the end of the day its all up to how you play and if you had fun edited though the game is not as it was in its prime when it became f2p you can argue that its dead as it has an active community and player base after the whole wave of overwatch killing tf2 i am confident to say that tf2 is very much alive and a game that i continue to and love to play
fun game once you get the hang of it lots of grinding away until you can get a really useful vehicle but thankfully the came scales engagements so you wont be hopelessly outclassed lots of tactics to learn in order to survive but even a defeat can be enjoyable you get a bonus is you are last man standing on your side when time runs out rarely get that myself because id rather engage than hide
i love creativerse i have not played in ages as im typing im installing i played creativerse a while back and it was great i cant judge minecraft over creativese there both cool games but in creativerse there is a lot more things to doalso i like the way you added dlc packs so people can buy them to unleash lots more fun into the game
aside from the baphomet symbol and sun symbol on the dice ads the game is pretty much pay2win where you fork over money to buy dice that give you greater chances to roll those winning numbers in which case multiplayer session will be brutal even those sessions where you choose no gadgets doesnt mean they wont be using the special dice plenty of times i was so close to winning only to be devasated at the last few moments of gameplay just garbage with satanic overtures when you run out of tokens no way to play anymore sessions unless you fork over money or wait till the next day for a lucky handout if anything at all
early access reviewphenomenal game with one major flawâ â â â ing love this game since it game out its only getting better and better pro graphic is absolutely stunning my twenty one imac late twenty twelves with an i5 runs very well on low setting with windows 10developers listens to their playergameplay is very balance with each ship carrying their unique role not pay to win con sadly not enough players and that causes long wait time for match making which you cant blame the developer for hopefully this game grows bigger as there is plenty of margin to expand i can totally see this game being played in a serious tournement
the best online non ww2 fps with massive battles a game ahead of it s time there is nothing like it a testament to what greatness sony made before they left pc games you may have to hunt for a team and some maps may be locked other than that it is a perfect game
"early access reviewpure banter spam buttons and hope for the best a great developing game very promising for the future there is some skill to this game but it is mostly luck and spamming for me anyway despite being 2d it doesnt fell flat the developers clearly care about this game as almost every time i go on there is a new update very promoising and i look forward to future updates and to the developers other games id rate this game eighty one thousand, one hundred"
this game is truly one of the funniest and funnest games ive ever played i highly recommend this game for anyone looking to dominate a server in bloody glory or to casually turn demomen into hamburger no matter your skill level tf2 is for you
the game is great fun and an amazing game to play with friends tons of room for progression and customization isnt half bad either through the use of dyesskins one downside is the presence of microtransactions while they are there they are not obtrusive and pay to win is kept mostly to a minimum almost every item you can buy with gold can be gotten ingame for free some exceptions include backpacks xp potions pet food and loot tier potions
idle gameif you dont like long term rewards several hours to days to accomplish a simple thing then this games not for you you need patience or money this is a game you play on your two screen while doing something or to relax or to just check once in a while
early access reviewhi alli have spent sixty four hrs on this game i see lot of potential but its too early to release even the early access what i loved multiplatform there is some effort on the diversity of the map and mobs teleportation what i hated no character improvement system lazy dialogs repetitive quests very slow evolution poor craft system some empty dungeons
war gaming is the worst company i have seen u will play with a group of idioits in this game and u will always loss game even u pay money to buy golden tanks the game matching system is so disgusting that it always sells gift bags and doesnt care about the games partitioning mechanism
early access reviewreally excited to see how this game evolves with the time ive put in so far i have started 2v2 ranked duos with a buddy of mine and see a lot of potential in this the synergy is unreal
i do not recommend this game for the following reasons there are discontinued overpowered items in the game standard league new players will realistically speaking never attain these old players brag about these in the global chat andor on videos there are items with a droprate so low theyre deemed mythical grinding your off for these items is not fun at all the game is hard to get into it is required to download a loot filter just to be able to distinguish crappy loot from good loot the trading system is clunky you are required to keep an internet browser open with a trading website to get the ingame name of someone who is selling whatever you want the entire trading system being outside the game is just stupid and allows players to write simple tools to gain an unfair advantage in trading however there are certainly ways to still enjoy this game after completing the main storyline run a couple of maps whenever you feel like it the temporary leagues do not include the discontinued items however at the end of each league your character gets transfered to standard the loot filters are completely customisable which is nice even the drop sounds for specific items can be set to your liking overall i do not recommend this game to anyone who values hisher time
for all the people who are whining about the game not having an auction house please stop this is what makes the game different its not like you are just buying something for currency and instantly getting it you actually have to interact with the traders now i know that this might cause some problems for people who have bad pcs but trust me this is very healthy for the community today i wanted to buy an atziris disfavour for five exalted orbs but i did not have the currency for it and i kindly asked the guy to please not sell it because i really need it but i dont have the currency yet and you know what happened he sold it to me for four exalted orbs now this may not sounds much but having nice people like this helping you makes your day better also about the server issues poe is free to play and betrayal had double the players compared to last leagues launch which was really popular and it broke the records at that time and they werent expecting that many players they also apologized for the issues and fixed it as soon as possible poe is all about trial and error even if you have couple hundreds of hours and feel like you know everything trust me you dont even if you feel like its all about the rng it really isnt if you run blood aqueducts for two hours you are garaunteed to atleast get about ten chaos orbs
early access reviewits not bad its not great its not unique and its not anything new but its not bad that being said it is worth noting this game is still in beta so what were currently seeing is just an unfinished product hopefully by the time it comes out itll have more indepth character customisation a more unique combat system and vastly improved map design seriously the areas in this game are huge for some unknown reason and there is no sprint button either at least not one ive found yeti havent played an adventure quest game since ten years ago when i was still just a dumb kid who didnt know what he was getting into it is nice to see that artix entertainment is still alive in kicking despite the time thats passed
early access reviewthis game does not run well for a lot of people when the game was released on may two hundred and eighty two thousand and eighteen there was an outcry because the game is poorly optimized if you buy this set a timer for two hours if you do not like it be sure to get your steanm refund before your two hours are up and i believe having the game launcher open counts against the time some people could not get the game to start after hitting play in the launcher but that bug may be fixed now also to report bugs and offer suggetions https blessonline zendesk comhcenusif you like tinkering with ini files to get the game to work better this might be your game you may need to do that as of today you cannot edit the ui there is not any addon support i do not think there will be addon support in the future this game is ea people have cobbled together fixes to get the game to run better there have beeen a few patches as of today jume eighteen byr the game still is not running any better if you buy the game remember it is not polished it will have rough edges it seems to run better for some people who have older computers it runs on unreal engene three and direct x nine there was a little talk about upgrading the game but nothing came of that this game needs time to be great
early access reviewi dont know how i feel about this game as of now i havent played very long but i can say i have enjoyed it on the one hand it most definitely has some p2w elements but the starting equipment isnt too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates p2w games the early game is pitted against you enemies have grenades tanks automatic weapons and all you have is a basic semiauto rifle fortunately i discovered most people in heroes and generals arent very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me i still manage to score reasonably well sometimes i have only played as an infantry and am rank five or so so dont take this review too seriously the vehicles are solid and its good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point crack crack crack the sounds do need some work thoughgameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2i would recommend this game simply because its free if they made me pay ten and removed and the pay2win elements i would accept in an instant hell maybe even twenty
full of exploitersuntil this has been fixedhttp steamcommunity id542495118i wont be bothered with this game because when we play online or try the leader boards the times are set by people like him below was my recommend review unfortunately the leader boards still havent been fixed and the below review was written on july eight th two thousand and fifteen potential raceroom racing experience has as a lot of itthe game is great and simulates the cars close enough or what id recon at least there are a few things missing but more on that later the races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer the setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy these cars which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome hats off for near flawless multiplayer code the free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars there are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to circuit de barcelonacatalunya and the other a more narrow circuit similar to circuit gilles villeneuve both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every cornerive yet to try the get real difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars but i do hope there are some presets to chose from the jeoff crammond grand prix games didnt have and see where that lead them there are however some problems with the game the first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least no need for me to dig deeper into it read the other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content the actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line and id like to see different type of weather too like rain for example the leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some short cuts invalidating the lap a reset of the leader boards should be done asap sector3 studios are working continuously on the game and with that in mind and seeing the potential itll bring raceroom racing experience very far
have you ever wanted to quest ever welcome to everquest a game where you can quest as long as you like forever if youd like a game where leveling is ever lasting and pvp is ever exciting watch your back you could be ganked by someone ever so quietly but dont be scared you can stay in towns and craft if you wanted to ever everquest two a little bit of everquest just with a two
it was fun for a long time but its really grindy and becoming more and more pay to win as we speak the devlopers stopped caring aout mkaing an actual good game afte rthe steam release and only wanted to make money as quickly as possible
smite is probably the best moba out there whilst lol and dota focus on a birdseye perspective smite gets right into the action in third person skill shot based gameplay using mythical deities from global pantheons such as the ancient greeks the ravenous mayans or even the newest pantheons being voodoo slavic and polynesian there is a character that represents apart of almost every single corner in the world with almost one hundred mostly different characters to choose from there is something for everyone whilst not every release can be as unique as ganesha or the morrigan especially with the latest chernebog being unpopular in the community the game has endless combinations of team comps and thus provides a lot of fun especially with a twoweek update rotation there is constantly something being added whether a new god or game mode or much needed balance balance is not the best in smite its arguably one of its weak points the meta is constantly changing and for new players it may be difficult to get into the competetive scene yet with constant updates this isnt always a problem monetization is strictly cosmetics loot boxes are a thing however the recent and fairly priced daily bundles give you random exclusive skins for around ten you can also earn premium currency in game for logging in daily or gem storm events one issue however is there are constantly events back to back giving no rest to a collector limited skins pop up left and right and it does get tiring seeing your favorite character get a new limited skin but not being able to purchase it due to spending your money on the last limited skin a week ago there is a lot of free items given out however you can get free items for winning games and leveling up will earn you previously exclusive items the esports side is professionally handled and enjoyable to watch with all its faults smite is a really good moba that id suggest everyone try while it can be frustrating at times hirez usually always comes through and responds to its community toxicity is a problem in any game and smite is no different but ignoring negative players through the mute button is as easy as a click and the newly added commendation system encourages positivity overall smite is enjoyable and provides something for everyone despite its few issues in balancing and player toxicity pass that is a game worthwhile
tf2 summed up4 fortyfive pm tilt i really didnt think4 fortyfive pm tilt i could meet ppl more than the ones ive met on cs4 fortyfive pm tilt tf24 fortyfive pm tilt proves me wrong4 fortyfive pm tilt everytime
i have played this game for a about two years now almost exclusively outside steam i have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game general characteristics of the game the hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game it is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game you can play in any way you want some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt downloading this game for free will give you very limited options you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt one species however if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of the achievement system depends on the animals you shoot and the weapons you use killing animals and using different weapons gives you hunterscore which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards if you wish to have all the weapons it will cost you a lot of money however there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game buying licenses for specific species is something i would advise against if you buy membership packs you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time some nice weapons and gear furthermore this game has two types of current em and gm the em can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store the gm is earned by doing missions and special events and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun if you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store dont hesitate to message me on steam i can give you some advice on what to buy pros there are many different species atypical and rare colored animals can be found albino melanistic etc there are many different weapons incl rifles handguns bows modern and old very nice reserves good graphics many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters its challenging it will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it frequent updates many special events holidays with special competitions and store discounts many great people in the community a very active forum where all your questions can be answeredcons it has bugs it often takes a long time before they are fixed some of these have been around for a long time server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours its expensive if you want to have a lot of gear very limited options for character customisationcheers gierenhart grafzerk in thehunter
ill admit ive stopped playing this game but not because i didnt like it if i didnt like it i wouldnt have one thousand hours in it i stopped playing because the economy was failing for anyone looking to play a game with a good trading economy i honestly cant recommend tf2 any longer but if your looking for a kind community and endless fun this is the game for you its cartoony and classy at the same damn time
early access reviewgarbage do not buy stay far away save your moneyoh where to start i guess we ll take it from the login screen game freezes on bless screen and won t let you in you play the rng game before you even get inside the game lolafter the initial cluster fk they opened new servers to manage the numbers but these are all founders edition ppl that already used up the founder items which were character bound another mistake by these idiots had it been account bound ppl would ve managed the servers better so essentially if they wanted to use those items they were locked into that server and no choice but to wait and keep login backunion faction was almost instantly full forcing you to pick the othertranslation of the skills some of the items and even ui were garbagefps in this is probably the worst that i have ever seen optimization is nonexistent one healing class in the game with atrocious tool kit for healing so bad that even they have realized it and said will balance god knows when dupe bug in auction housea lot of ppl and by a lot i should probably say the two hundred or so emissaries that feel special they were invited to hotel meeting room to see a garbage presentation which was a big red flag for anyone that saw it go see for yourself on youtube say that the game is in early access which is an absolute st of an excuse for a game that has launched three times before launching in na korea failed russia failed japan mehsemi failed and finally this na mega garbage festi personally think steam shouldn t consider this a game good enough to be here and give full refunds to anyone that bought it and help us close down this game forever this company is one giant con and they hop from one region to another collect what money they can and then off to the next although i think we were the final touch
early access reviewi really enjoy this game like a lot of course as any other game theirs glitches ect but not too major a shoutout to the devs keep up the good work if you like any other block game then youll definitely love this game and even more i can personally say that im addicted
"due to the immense amount of positive reviews for this game few will read this and even fewer will listen however i simply cannot reccomend a game that runs at one thousand, eight hundred and twenty five frames on damn near the lowest settings while anything truly important is going on especially when the specs of my computer twelve gb ram fx8350 gtx seven hundred and fifty ti clearly are superior to the reccomended system requirements of the game there are times where i get framerates closer to four thousand and sixty however these times are few and far between and only take place in desolate areas without players vehicles or even the simplest structure i have other complaints about this game although im sure other negative reviews already cover them so ill leave it to fellow dissapointed players to voice their opinions on the matter i am saddened by my experiences with the game especially due to how fun it seems it would be if it were to run properly at least it was free"
been playing this game since two thousand and ten ive met some interesting and awsome people on this fps game on some community servers the nine classes are psychotic mercs but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from sfm videos and the tf2 comics the many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats and of course cosmetics it gives you many different loadouts and play styles you could even add mods for more playability there are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the steam community market but i enjoy the community servers and different game modes payload payload race sd doomsday pass time versus saxton hale randomizer x10 ctf koth control point mann vs machine surf trade servers mann power halloween mode maps and much more and dont forget now there is competitive and casual play as well if your interested there is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs surfing and rocketstickysentry jumping although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible i disagree sure it has some problems but it has a very good community with big events like tip of the hats as i said before the tf2 characters are more interesting and have a very crazy but also lovable personality and they interact with each other in game

early access reviewit was all good and fun the first week before they made it impossible to solo on a ranger which i was having so much fun on tried to refund the game i think the day after steam stopped accepting them didnt know at the time got denied so now its just sitting there as seventy five free to neowiz ive tried to log in a few times since but i never last more than five minutes at this point thirtytwo days left on my premium status but only used about seven days of it so sad to know that they get to keep the money for unused accounts that were unable to refund
early access reviewi like it but i dont is cool a poor call of duty but if you get banned from cs go for like 7d or 1h or you wanna waste some time running sistem sux and your first game will sux as well but when you get use whit it is pretty cool
i do like the game as well as the extra planes and huey which i bought and added on the graphs are really great and the game is really great to play a couple things which can be improved very much on is they need to have interactive training tutorials for every plane and helicopter etc i realize it is a flight sim but there would also be many more people purchasing the moduls and playing it if it were more player friendly such as simple to learn and use basic controls to just get flying and shooting with many people that fly things like microsoft flight sim x plane etc and many people in the older age groups find it a little over whelming to try to have to learn and remember so many different commands so a easy version would not be that hard to include in the controls people would have a choice as to how they want to fly that way instead of making more and more complex planes how about making some simpler to control ones which would also get you more paying customers as they would graduate up to bigger better planes also along with the interactive tutorials you should have better and easier ways to figure out how to set up and bind a joy stick combo for easier to fly planes etc include interactive tutorials on every plane etc especially for the basics of flying taking off landing and a little about basic combat use of guns etc make it more player basic settings for newbies please remember most of us arent real pilots like you seem to have here putting people down who are new and trying to learn and most of us cant afford to run out and spend fifty thousand up to try to build a actual simulator and get the wart hog combat pedals track ir or vr etc even though some of us have things like the x52 pro trackir and pedals from other games
you like games like magic the gathering and hex and are happy with their format and close resemblance to their gameplay this is your game for there are no suprises here and no real innovation so if you want to play with new cards go for it but first1first you have to get through long and boring tutorial2 then through long and boring ai deck gauntlet at lowest level they only play twelve relevant spells per game finally you can play some other formats including ranked and draft about draft instead of drafting against human opponents you are drafting vs ai but you play vs humans what really kills that format yeah sure it saves waiting time but it makes the format pointless even i managed to go seventy one in my first draft i was upgraded to silver rank and then gold soon and then it became really hard by that time i still found that the game was kind of fun and decided to buy the founder pack to get the campaign cards quickly five days later i completely regret the desision this game is not for me i do not like magic anymore i played magic the gathering father of that type of card games for fifteen years and i have been off magic for another ten with all the possibilities why dont you have creativity to improve on the format not just offering the same game and yeah i dont like merhcant cards in constructed units that access your sideboard during the game i dont like the mana screws i dont like the sites mechanic pwoerful castle that casts free spell each turn ending with powerful champion nothing about this games gameplay is that i can really recommend and ui it is really hard to figure out how to use ui for some of the more complicated targeting spells prepare to get several losses before you figure that all out
a true flight sim for any pilot enthusiest especially if you are considering a military career this isnt a game that u just jump into and expect to start flying you need a basic understanding of flight instruments if u get an addon with a clickable cockpit you will have to spend hours going through the training courses just to know how to start and operate the aircraft systems you really cannot claim to master any aircraft without putting at least the standard of forty flight hours into each aircraft the sense of accomplishment as u struggle with one apect then turn it into an easy task is what keeps me playing when u get that perfect 3point touchdown with the p51 then start doing it over and over u really feel like its a major acheivement at this point i only have fifty hours on the game and i still feel like a noob im very confident with the p51 now and ill be going into the a10 addon next as to physics i cannot say whether they are absolutely realistic or not but i am highly impressed if u put the time into the game and really try to learn how to fly thats when u get the entertainment factor out of it it greatly helps to buy a dlc with clickable cockpit also and i will tell any pilot enthusiest to get this game
early access reviewi really was not impressed with the controlls of the game the concept is awesome and i love the cutesy style to it but the controls are just a massive turn off for me i really wish they would have a setting to turn down the sensitivty of the mouse or some type of option to enable wasd for walking and mouse just for viewing updownleftright a lot of potential though
early access reviewokay the main problem is they want control over your win rate whats completely making me out of my confort zone is that sometime i got the feeling they take us for more stupid than we are they have many way of doing so first they absolutely control your winloss rate by controlling the mana cards you get at the start of your game and what time youll draw them if its not that it will be colors issueseven if for now every other ccg agreed that the mtg mana mechanics is totally obsolete and antifun they just guive you a stuckish feeling witch is never a good experiece for a player if you want to hook them to your gameso if you tried to avoid being mana colorsramp stuck youll go dumbaggro like most of the players theresecundo this game is not pure randomness proof youll never eeeeever draw the same nonmana cards in a row this is the pure proof they riiged and its not randomness thirdioso they have vs deck type brackets if your playing slow deck with really specific cards in it youll play against deck braket thats playing either exacly the same cards or the counter brakets were your opponent play exacly what they need to counter your specific cards fourthioso the mulligan are the worst you dont have any kind of sideboard so if they want to put you in a situation and give you no option and just let you drop cards after cards they can sorry but for me a game is played when you have option to think and choice to make most of the time now its just some time it happenwhat is fun about the game after you pass and accept the rigged meta is when you acually have choice to do im talking about true choice here not stupid one if you make good choice by playing your rigged cards options or not youll get granted by a win or a punish by loosing unfortunately i have the feeling the game is not enough focused on that side for the moment trust me its just a question of time untill you get the logic of their rigged meta and give this post a like
by far the worst racing game ever the controls are terrible and there is no ai racing only time attack modes for what i can see in the game all i have to say is go play the forza grid and grand turismo series they are way better then this steaming pile of crap
early access reviewi put about twentyfive hours into this game but now im quitting and i dont recommend you waste your time eternal creators dont understand how to balance cards and legendaries dominate the game they are also incedibly incredibly rare after about twentyfive hours i have legendaries for five of the original and five of the expansion and now oh now they decide to update the game to give less prizes so now instead of winning a silver crate every third ranked win which only nets you a rare anyways now you get two reds which each one gives you a common this game is grind city and now they are getting greedier many of their card creation is just idiotic as well for instance there is a cockroach that gives every other cockroach in your hand and deck eleven every time you play it so theres an entire deck dedicated to just playing a hundred cockroaches over and over and over through copying and bringing it back sounds exciting doesnt it hey its a cockroach and another and another and another and another hey a cockroach for the fifth and sixth turns in a row this is a fun game with exciting interactions s and thats when you arent running into decks that are made of nothing but legendaries which have no limitations on them the eternal creators seem to want to take all the fun out of actually playing the cards and they dont understand how to design a card game whatsoever its a shame because it was fun for a little while until the flaws became glaringly obvious and prizes were reduced oh and there are plenty of bugs too for instance theres a weapon that gives where number of justice power you have banked up its a weapon that does not give this ability to a creature but for some reason when your creature gets silenced it also silences your weapon which its not supposed to do think they would fix it in their three latest bug fixes nope
i dont know why people are hating on this game this is a great game that adapted from the mobile version the game lags less and you can see the screen much better though it is not portable except on laptops get this game and you will not regret it also it is not a pay to win game i have so many caps and pets because of doing the right stuff i also got lucky on a lunchbox but anyways i think you should get this game
product received for freeearly access reviewnever really played this game didnt like it then but i occasianolly had fun with itnow i just ing despise this piece of not worth the space on my computer or my time dont get this piece of of a game i think this is the reason valve added the recent user reviews so when a game becomes you can tell
fantastic game unfortunately stuck with a small player base try it out if you like scifi space combat ships are detailed and crisp one map with different eviroments three ship manufacters with distinct styles and ships sound design is six hundred and ten gfx are eight hundred and ten gameplay is a eight hundred and ten game is medium to slow paced unless playing some of the faster ship classes small playerbase making matchmaking take forever and only at certain times7510 give it a go bois
if the original world of tanks its too much for you and believe it is for a lot of people this one is just right for you accessible minimum requirements faster paced than its older brother perfect for casual play you dont need many hours to achieve stuff i really like this one
early access reviewloading screen simulator teamed up with queueing simulator and decided to hire that one guy from babelfish too you have become ten levelon a more serious note if you thought revelation online had poor localization this game asks you to hold its beer spending a vast majority of the time trying to even get the game to even run past the splash screen then trying to actually get into the game then fighting past the performance issues you may eventually end up being just as confused as me when you even attempt to read your skill descriptions when you end up playing a game and just pushing buttons to see what happens not even wanting to look at your skill tooltips in order to avoid being even more confused than before you kind of know something is wrong id wager the english patch for the japanese version is more localized than this hot mess edit for clarity i put in for a refund avoid until the game is patched up with actual english translations and better optimization if that even happens
bless online i like the game and want more people to play it but at the same time i acknowledge the fact that it runs excruciatingly bad even on a monstrously powerful rig you can hit spots that bring your frames down to single digits overall i like the universe they have here and i was excited to try the game for a couple of years now since it was announced that being said i understand why players are leaving so often i feel like the game could easily be saved with more attention from the devs more focus on what the community needs fixing i dont think bless will find its place i want it to but i have a feeling bless is bound for the graveyard sooner than most failed mmo games if you want to try it now is your best chance because i doubt it will be around long i hope some day in the future they rerelease bless as a finished and fixed product i think the best thing right now for the game would be for anyone interested to try the game and then voice constructive feedback to the devs make sure htey know what needs changed
i will admit i got hooked on this game since before it was on steam since the open beta actually the lore make much more sense being inspired by myths and legends and gods and the gameplay is quite nice i commend hirezs continued support and updates tho i dont get the one something gigs of updates for twenty three skinsso all in all i have only good things to say about the game hence the reason i cant recommend if you dont want to be hooked to another online moba dont play this its good its really good and that also means its gonna take up a lot of your time and it attracts a lot of toxic kids also making the community meh
so here we are i have started playing dota two in twenty fourteens and from that time i have to say it has drastically changed we could have seen many updates and map changes going through the history but by time the community got worse with each update that has came since people started playing just the overpowered heroes to complete their quests for compendiums and other but dota two is an amazing game with a lot of possibilites you and other four heroes are defending your towers against other five enemy heroes and you try to destroy their towers leading to destroying the ancient after that you win and you can go play another match again if you have friends that dont mind to spend few cold nights with ya playing dota two just grab them and start having fun there are over one hundred heroes in the game so it will take you a lot of time to master all of them after my 3k hours i am far from mastering one of them heh then there are frequent updates that keep the game fresh loads of mods official ones or community ones game is maintained and is definetly one of the best games for free you can find around i have found that the game is quite distracting or way too complex at the beginning for new players the tutorial just isnt enough to get you going so if you have a friend with some hours already played ask him for a help because trust me you will need it matchmaking still needs some work since it is unbalanced sometimes aswell as some heroes this game is about keeping going if you give up you have no place in this game if your nerves are strong enough and you can cooperate with your team i know it isnt always possible since the teammates suck often you will have much better experience than people that keep raging this game is tuff the only thing i can do is to wish you good luck and have fun bring some friends and start the party overall eight hundred and ten
"early access reviewused to be a go to game for me updates and game balances later it turned a pretty nice game to a heaping mess of grinding two million, four hundred and seventy one thousand and ten for concept010 for execution"
trove is a great game to play with your friendand to use one hundred and sixty bombs to blow up a ton of stuff for no reasonbad part is the people crying about the queue they are trying to fixeditthe queues are getting alot betteredit againno queues for a long time
so this is a port of the mobile app like a direct port i mean this game displays friggin horizontally as it would on a mobile display pass on this one everyone either play this on your phone play yugioh duel generations on your phone or the best option download ygopro
early access reviewthis game is amazing to say it is only in alpha definite must buy for anyone who likes games like sto star conflict or elite dangerous also its a great price at only â seven
at first its fun to play its damage system research shell etc but later i tend to play with one rank above mine its so difficult to give some damage let alone penetrate sigh this bad matchmaking same as well as wot but i do prefer this one than the other one
this game is pure for the company to get money from the players i am a tanker in realistic simulator and arcade and i dont fly anymore because stalium on planes and since youre not getting much research points i get about eight hundred rp in realistic and twelve hundreds rp in arcade simulator is a timed event so you cannot go in your favourite tank at any time in simulator also counts for planesthey also got a bad system for ranking tanks and planes with a seven br difference possibility so when you have a tiger one you face of with t44s the team is not realible because they all want kills to get rp and get the new vehicle the tow hook for example is in game already a long time yet nobody knows about it and the spawnrape is real expecially in realistic and simulator a bad system for teamkillers how do i know i was about to shoot a enemy and clicked to shoot bam teammates shows up behind a rock and i get kicked for that aciidental teamkill and all i get is a loss in lions and go to the main page where i just can go directly to a new battle the post war is real m8 you got vehicles that dident even existed in ww2 and mixing ww2 vehicles with post war ones doesent make it accurate at all not only that they also wanted to make a realistic game with not realistic armor on tanks and planes and planes that never flew or left the designer table prices go always up and so do reserch points needed and now im talking more about rp it takes me atleast a week or two to get a new vehice with many hours spent alot of people will get frustated with all the above so they would pay to get to the high tiers for a free to play game dus people are leaving the game more and more making it emptyer and so they increase the br difference for fast games making unbalanced gamesthe only good thing is the lion gain and the graphics and the models and thats it
it is pretty hard to give this game a solid yes or no considering there is a lot to love and to hate about this game pros amazing graphics realistic world of tanks doesnt even come close to this level of realism lots of different vehicles welloptimised not as pay to win as one might thinkcons technically speaking however it is pay to win average toxic free to play community unlocking tanks can be a real grind game developers dont know what creating and maintaining a community is
this game is so amazing honestly it is the best fps game i have ever played and i would reccomend it massively it isnt too great for new players and it can be hard to get into i think with just a little bit of tweaking to the introductory system and maybe more optimizations it can be amazing to get into just a fair warning to new players you will die a ton i have over two hundred and seventy hours on this game and i still die a ton but that may just be because i suck anyways its a great game one thousand and ten would reccomend
summaryan idler clicking weeb game my gripesno steam achievements gives no incentive to play but for a few moments requires a mod to make the ladies uncensored ratingstale hentai idler nothing special here210
love this game sort of a good cross between pcars and assetto corsa no muss or fuss sit down and start racing the dlc model is a little complicated but once you figure that out youre good to go
first impressions are very impressive drives really nice force feedback is excellent the track i was on was exceelent and ai behaves very well free to play and if you like it theres loads of dlc you can purchase its worth downloading just for the free go i highly recommend it and this race sim is way up there with assetto corsa and project cars
ive only played three hours of this and it is already one of my favourite games yes it is a little weird controlling it but it wasnt originally ment for pc so i think this game is definitely a must have game also this game is free and for the quality game it is that is an incredible thing nothing on this game is pay to win so do not believe people who say it is becuase i have gotten things that are very good without paying a penny and the only ever reason to pay in this game is if you are unapreciative i know i proably spelt that wrong of its content or are too lazy to be bothered to play fore more than ten seconds and want to finish the game on your first day playing it anyway thank you for reading my review i hope you all found it helpful and bye
early access reviewknowing this is an alpha product usually means i expect trouble my experience was smooth the game is pretty engaging with a reasonably low learning curve for getting right into play short videos from the main menu helped the community was immediate welcoming teamspeak is a good pairing and greatly enhances the game very excited to see how it progresses
lets be honest the only reason im writing this review is because i need to write a review for the fall sale badge that being said i do really enjoy this game hence the twentysix hundreds hours its a great little time filler between other things i do definitely worth the only downside i think is that the packages are sooo expensive for some really good items and crafters edit i very much recommend this game its not meant to be played quickly it requires a long grind but the grind is quite enjoyable if you dont try to force it
i used to play mc a lot not as much as some but i played and enjoyed it unfortunately i couldnt always play as often as i would have liked to be good at mc you really need to play regularly there are alot of things that you have to remember crafting recipes to really enjoy the game sure there are tons of mods that add all kinds of functionality and stuff but then your dealing with mods which can be tricky and difficult to stay up to date with plus with mods everytime they update the game you have to fix all your mods its a commitment so eventually i just stopped playing it at all along comes creativerse the first thing i noticed was that i didnt have to remember a bunch of crafting stuff or install some scetchy mods its right there in a menu ingame if you have played any first person shooter game then the controls will be very familiar the game developers seem to be very open to new ideas and the community of players are very helpful and involved you can choose to play on one of the public worlds or spawn a completely private world all of your very own or do both the survival element of the game is there but seems to be less of the focus people just want to build and build and build and then share what they built with others the devs seem to be perfectly happy to provide a place and the tools to do that the game is still evolving and growing and as such has some issues little things like sometimes you can see right through a section of blocks to the caves below but if you try to move that way you walk right into the wall and sometimes the liquids just dont quite act right there is other stuff but nothing major just bugs that being said there is one thing that is really starting to get to me though the critters generally i dont play survival im there to build stuff and explore not hack my way through a horde of beasties so in the settings i play with fiendly and sparse creatures turned on that way i can just work without getting attacked all the time except now they just walk right through the middle of everything and tend to gather in large groups to stand where ever i happen to be working at first i was entertained and intrigued when i heard that the creature ai developer had a cat that hung out at his desk and used it for inspiration but when you are several thousand blocks into an intricate build and every few seconds you have some thing just walk right through you and the space youre working in it can get damn irritating you just might find yourself screaming incoherent profanties at them pulling your sword and straight out massacring every thing you can find i really need to figure out a way to keep them away sorry anyway the game is a lot of fun it is very easy to build whatever you can imagine the community is open and welcoming and the developers have alot more stuff yet to come i recommend creativerse to anyone that enjoys an open world sandbox kinda game
chaos utter chaos if you like large scale battles with hundreds of other players on large planets where each faction is vying for control of terriotry then you might like this game if you like to actually feel like you have a purpose like your making a difference in the war then you probably wont the battles are so huge with so many people that its hard to tell whether or not what your doing is actually helping you oftem feel like another foot soldier thats simply cannon fodder and ultimately isnt making a difference in battle unless you role with an organized crew a couple friends or some sort of clan then its highly unlikely that youll feel like youve actualy accomplished something in this game the gun fghts do get pretty intense and when your not constantly respawning because you keep getting shot from who knows where then it can be fun
early access reviewfreejam has continiously shown that they have no vision for this game and dont know what theyre doing theyre blatantly ignoring the majority of player feedback and stubbornly continue to stick to updates no one enjoys or wanted in the first place they remove large pieces of content on a whim megabots2 gamemodes and the f2p model has gotten greedier and greedier as time went on furthermore theyve changed their payment model but if you purchased items with real money that are now available with in game currency you where never refunded for them wow crate rewards are far too low and we need to be rewarded more especially in deathmatch and the losing team is always screwed over with a crap crate even if they individually performed very well freejam seems to believe that it should take hundreds of hours to get to any sort of endgame so if youre fairly casual this game simply isnt for you
after one hour of trying to get the steering lock working it does work in several other games i wanted to restart my pc the game crashed as i wanted to quit it which led to the game not starting any more as i am not willing to download 30gb of a buggy mess again i just uninstalled thats how you dont make new customers and i cant believe a five year old game got such problems fortunately i was able to get this bad experience for free
the game is actually really fun bullet reg is on point guns work well and for a free alpha game its moving along fairly quickly the only concern is how often the game crashes for people including myself its a free game in early alpha stage get over yourselves
two types of people before the downdate this is going to be sick please add volvo this will be a disaster tf2 is mostly casual it doesnt make any sense why thewy would add thisafter the downdate both parties were forced into the melting pot matchmaking takes forever and i just want to play in pub servers revert the updatei kinda agree
i have always loved this game i love the idea of owning my own home be it an inn or prestige and being able to decorate it lots of endless possibilities i love doing the quests crafting raids the most unique part of this mmo compared to others the guides they are there to chat listen to your concerns and they take time out of their day to also run quests a game i will continue to play
the best thing you can say about this game is that its free and when i say free its one hundred free in no way will not spending hold you back at all that being said why play a free game if its no fun the game as most of its type is grindy but thats fine if the story is good or the dungeons varied in path of exile the story as far as i got was well not a story rather just a few npcs who would make a funeral more depressing and you keep finding yourself skipping the text before you fall asleep the dungeons are no better maybe the lead dungeon designer got bored after making three types underground forest coast and thought noone would notice the lvling up system is quite interesting using a final fantasy type spider system allowing millions of different combinations which would allow for hundreds of styles of play but in reality only a few will work for every character so caution is required as making a mistake on your leveling pathway could mean you end up with a dud many hours later expect for that it really is just a standard arpg with poor graphics that even free is not recommand over van helsing or torchlight
online is broken like dayz standalone hardly ever works and always failure to join friends and random tabs out tried everything from all sources of help and come realize this game is just poorly made the game play itself when you can play is great though but thats a if
early access reviewall im gonna say is get ready to get mad at how t the guns are its litterlay who can fire first when your using a mp44 and the guy snipes u with a shotgun something need to be fixed here
realm of the mad god jee saying its name brings back old memories when i would play this game using flashplayer enough blabbering about my life realm of the mad god is a top down pixel rpg everything i just said is like all you need to know oh wait add in a couple thousand people grinding their off and may i say this community was so friendly i had a blast playing this game by myself and with friends grinding our characters away yeah that sounded weird as hell but you get the point just play the game if youre looking for something free and something to kill your time with you wont regret it yeah thats basically it
i am a vivit league of legends player but i can enjoy to play this after league its such a difference that i can play the two next to each other without it being boring if the other game becomes boring in my opinion that is a good thing also best online community ragers and annoying people are really not that much around great game would recommend
its a great game but its a paytowin i was going to buy realm gold but it wouldnt even let me buy it its not completely paytowin you can get every item in the game by playing to get them
early access reviewgood game with potential wont reccommend though because technical support is poor seems to be no active forum mods at all no forum replys lack of support for game related payment issues will be the death of this game

ive played a lot of this game outside of steam i switched over to make patching easier its a niche game it also does cost some real money to get geared up and about 3month for full access playing this game via microtransactions isnt the way to go if youre starting get a bundle fifty will get you solid amount of gear and a year of the full game they have cheaper bundles too the free to play part of the game is closer to a demo though with rotating species and in game currency its doable if youre really that broke however the cost to play does go back into the game and it has grown significantly over the years ive played it there are a huge number of reserves and species the game itself is probably the best hunting game around i dont know of another that offers the same realistic and challenging gameplay stalking and making your shots count is very important and getting a trophy or rare animal feels like an accomplishment due to the challenge of even finding those types of animals if the steam achievement percentages mean anything only about twelve of people will play this game beyond a couple of hours thats ok like i said its a niche game and not for everyone but for those who like slower paced challenges and a fairly realistic hunting experience will enjoy whats there dont let the mixed reviews dissaude you from trying it out theres enough of the game there for free to decide whether its for you
early access revieweternal is the game that wizards of the coast should have made works cross platform on my ipad nexus four pc and macbook air with a fluid account system crisp fast intuitive ui single player mode excellent card design satisfying effects and above all engaging and fun gameplay also worth noting is the innovative draft system where you can come back to the middle of a draft a week later and continue picking from packs as for the iap products themselves i bought a sixty bundle for two boxes of cards i was happy with the amount of rares and crafting material i received to build new cards and decks i bought the jekks bounty expansion for ten and was happy with the campaign and the cards and i will probably buy every expansion if they continue this level of quality
early access reviewi will start by saying i have played this game before it was out on steam ive enjoyed this game as well as pubg i am a big fan of both they both have their differences but i like the end play of this one better it is a huge thrill having to climb up the ladder and hope you strategize correctly to not get shot to board safely the storm is also a different twist making it more random then a circle within a circle you have to play different to stay infront of the storm but also how you move within the map instead of a parachuting from plane to pick your location you pick before the game starts you also no longer look for backpacks but choose your mobility perk at the start when choosing your location which decides how much you can carry a glider can carry the least but move the fastest in the map hikingrappelling which moves slow through the map but can carry the most sense the map is all snow the last mobility perk is a snowboard your carry limit is in between the other two there is also ski lifts through out the map the new update improved weapons movement and all around smoothness of the game i believe the biggest loss with the new update is the way you upgrade or customize your charactersequipment its not as easy as using experience from your games played free game for me so i am not worried about that just the action with friends and the game playover all the the game is awesome action packed best played with mic friends and scopes add me ramitinashol
welcome exile im just gonna say this say goodbye to your good grades social life wife and kids and welcome the hours of free to play content stash tabs are the best upgrade but not necessary the rest is up to you exile may the goddess of justice bless your eternal labyrinth run
product received for freeearly access reviewedit do not download installs malware with gamejoin game find m1camp in housesome idiot walks in does not see meshoot him eight times in the back he turns and oneshots megg jpgthe game runs well and looks good but the armor appears to be baised on some sort of random drop most games end with getting spawn killed by some guy with full armor i have never found any overallneeds work and could be good with work not worth playing as is
free is a lie you need to pay in order to be able to trade so its gated behind paywalls also mtx takes priority over game functionality on the dev teams side and the community is more toxic than that of league of legends most people are bitter solo players and i only find some slight enjoyment in this game because a have a roomie to play with in the pay to play private leagues free to play myâ â â â â
fun at first and playing the ai is engaging enough after that no different than the rest of the ccgs pay to win pvp is player after player who has legendary and epic cards in their hand unless you p2w also you will enjoy pvp as far as rarely getting a hit on the enemy or watch them play a few cards that dominate the match in less than ten rounds if you like that kind of frustration eight out of ten rounds then this is the game for you
one hundred ways to do the same build my favorite arpg just for the customization of builds alone if youre someone who enjoys coming up with builds youll enjoy this if you dont but are still one who enjoys arpgs theres plenty of builds on the community forums you can use as well
early access reviewcuando salió era medio malo pero ahora esta hermoso super mejorado y divertido lo único negativo es que sacaron el server latino pero si mas gente juega seguramente lo pongan otra vez
take pubg battlefield and john cenas steriods and put them into one game thats planetside for you night battles are bloody amazing best non triple a triple a game in the market65 would wreck my graphics card again
i still cant believe this is free to play amazing game huge battles lots of playstylesvehicles bases and on top of that if you choose to you get to play organized as a platoon comprised of four squads of twelve players each with amazing coordination if you find the right people one of a kind its not ptw but cosmetic upgrades can only be purchased with actual cash aside from that anything that is relevant to the game can be bought with in game currency that you earn playing the learning curve is a bit steep so give it some time
early access reviewgood easy controlseasy to tell friend from foeinteresting ship designs vareity and rolesteam work is important but you can still manage on your owncombat is challeneging but that also depends on your opponentthe game isnt super fast paced so you dont have to play like an mlg pro neutral its only five v five sometimes that isnt enoughpopulation isnt as big as it needs to bedont expect fair fights haha good luck trying to get a one v one goingsector map is kind of plainship blowing up animation could be way betterbad early accessno party system at least that i know ofno custom controlsno other game types or scenarios no singleplayer campaign screen feels clutteredenviorment isnt very interesting there should be some defensive stations on asteroids the stations themselves or on satillites that should attack youno evacuating your ship option i think if we are about to blow up we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our respawn timesniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths maybe im a bad sniper in this game but one play through left the worst taste in my mouth long range combat isnt very engaging or rewarding so im sticking to closemedium range conclusion despite the longer list of neutral or bad you must understand a lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later personal story i decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much i enjoyed playing it the most epic yet traumatic moment ive had so far was when i finished capturing an enemy base i spotted a weakened enemy vessel and i went ahead to pursue it in my enforcer when i heard more enemies are arriving i glanced to my left and saw four yes four enemy ships warp in i said oh f me and i was dead in seconds hahadespite my most epic moment was me being destroyed i only went two with five deaths and three kills our team even one even when the other team was far more coordinated with their assault and maneuvering
good game overall but but you are going into this with the intension of being a free to play player stop dont play this game konami only cares about money the meta game is full of pay to win decks that free to play players have no chance of beating they dont balance the ovr powered decks and dont give out any gems for free to play players to use to buy cards komoney
early access reviewthis is honestly such a fun game you can spend hours on this and not even notice you make your own world its awesome only downside that it heats my computer macbook pro up a lot and drains my battery quick but all in all its a great game
early access reviewno longer a must see updated to remove options bland nondescript time to play fortnitewith any game an update will please some and displease others but the jury is out on this update what was a clever and interesting twist on the latest rage of battle royale games has stripped back everything that made it unique and clever and left behind a mere relic not only has the class system with class weaponry been removed now you get forced into a random skin of a character regardless of what you might like what is far more annoying is the developers have decided which weapons you should able to play with meaning that often in games i find only secondary weapons and am not allowed to run two of them no longer are you able to run an heirloom rifle and shotgun or burst rifle and pistol at the crafting forges you have no choice over what is produced you simply say create gear and you might get something useful or waste your time instead of two abilities that were difficult enough to choose from the selection you now have only one again limiting your options movement abilities are now something that needs to be collected but some previously normal abilities are classed as these so again you cannot run roll and withdraw as the devs have decided for you there is no reason to want to engage and then run away either you want to go in or be a scaredy cat there is no room for anyone in betweeni have been pushing people to play with me but with this update its uninstalled and i really wish i hadnt wasted any money supporting them
early access review7318 alpha build reviewafter working myself up to diamond three and a playtime of thirty hours i figured i should give a little review for this game rather than listing every single pros and cons that are subject to change during the alpha and beta anyways i am just gonna point out the major things that realm royale in my opinion is doing better than every other battle royale out there1 the forging system the forging system incentivises you to stay on your toes throughout the entire early to mid game you are forced to actively look for fights to craft your legendary armor and weapons camping in this game is heavily punished in the late game as you will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the players that actively did look for kills to craft their stuff2 map and circle with an average gametime of around twenty minutes per match realm royale is probably one of the fastest battle royale games out there the circle actually hurts like hell in this game which means people will rarely unexpectedly sneak up on you from behind as gas camping is nearly impossible in this game the map itself is relatively small compared to other battle royale games which means if u will sometimes unexpectedly find yourself outside the play zone it is not necessarily a death sentence3 the five classes in realm royale you can pick between the class which all are unique and fun in their own way while certain classes like the engineer are easier to get into than other classes the variety of class specific abilities aswell as class weapons creates a very high skill ceiling for each individual class4 overall gameplay unlike other battle royale games that incentivise you to find cars around the map each player has their very own horse they can ride to move faster from forge to forge which as mentioned in point one leads to more fighting and therefore low downtime between all the stuff you have to do in this game the sound effect are very loud it is virtually impossible to sneak up on somebody as you will be able to hear their footsteps or shots from miles away this in my opinion leads to less frustrating death experiences as its promotes a fair chance for each participant of the fight these points alone make realm royale the best battle royale game that has been released since h1z1s early beta and offers everything i was always looking for in a battle royale game fast gameplay more fighting than looting high skill ceiling no wall building bullsht cough fortnitekeep up the great work hirez
malwarewell cant say much about the game played it didnt like it but thats just me its not a bad game though but after i uninstalled the game not everything was deleted there remained a tiny little annoying piece of software called gaijinagent alway loading on windows startup and not possible to uninstall i had to delete multiple folders even hidden ones from my harddisk and entries from my regeistry too by hand sorry but installing malware on my pc i cannot accept
it have an unfix bug like always dc after one min in game its really mess upmost of all service is so bad i look un facebook page and more same problem same at me and then they ignoring them allplease fix the problem i think you have amazing game and you have more fans but this is you please do you best to the game i think this game is better if have better customer service
early access reviewhard to reccomend i can see the potenial in this but its been in beta for years but it feels like it has a few more years to go before it near finished and balance i had some fun with it and put in about eighty hours over a few weeks but id say most of them hours were spent waiting to play and waiting to spawn the thing that i dont like about it is that at the time of writing this there is next to know cooperation in the fps part of the game no in game communication except for text chat which is hard to do when in a battle i really want to like this game and will check in on it again in a few months after one or to buildsupdate patches to the game to see if it has progressed
oh man its just soooo much fun putting so much effort into a vault only for the game to crash and erase all your progress im glad i didnt have to pay for this give this one a miss as even hammering rusty nails into your fingers would be more productive
most dissapointing game of the year i was really lookingforward to playing this but it takes forever to start up there are constant loading screens that take forever for no reason the gameplay is slow obviously for children and the character maker has all of about ten options
its fun it gets some points but its a clearly example for an unbalancedgame to earn im not asking for a everything free just take a look at dota two its a true f2p game of course a lot of pp pay thousands dollars for dota two but none of them can win the game by paying money i dont get it the mole rat which can use kage bushino jutsu and amaterasu while human which can stand and stare back to those mole rat with the gun in hand the armor on body
this is my first time reviewing a game and the only reason i am doing this is because many mmos on steam are very simular and most of the time badly produced and executed but this game is an exception on that stereotype heres why the game is really fun and surprises you in some categories the combat is surprisingly fun even though im just holding down a button and using my special moves from time to time the building is super in depth but it may not look like it at the beggining there are insane ammounts of decorative blocks and objects to place in your levelling system is what you would expect its quite slow but if you dont mind spending some time into the game to level heres where it gets complicated at the start the levelling is super fast and fun however i found my self spending a few hours just clearing dungeons from time to time and started getting repetetive but where i am now is the reason i had to write this review i wont spoil it but you get some cool stuff and you no longer are clearing dungeons to level you always have your own personal goal to do and have a normal goal too this made it so i was distracted from the tideous parts of the game and now focused on the personal quests and goals and awesome parts of the game this has easily become my most played and loved game on my steam library i highly suggest this if your into mmos
theres no other game like it no other game can give you a true open world fps its a game that will make you come back again and again unfortunately its a bit dated the graphics arent amazing the buildings look a bit like starwars stuff etc its an old game that is still being updated to this day it lacks the style and grit that the battlefield games have i wish companies would make games like this it has so much potential for now though this is the best truely open worldfpsmmo its one of my favorate games ever also its horribly paytowin and thats the only reason i dont waste my entire life on this game but try it and youll love it its worth your time
more complex than hearthstone hs less than mtg with a very fun meta game right now you can play it f2p and i personally feel its much fairer than hs in that regard but not as generous as duelyst or hand of the gods the visuals do appeal for me personally but some might find it too bland i think fans of the elder scrolls franchise will be quite happy though
wanna play a real world war two flying simulator then give war thunder a go the air combat is fantastic and amazing however the game has some serious flaws one there is a soft rp cap meaning if you get a victory and like thirteen tank kills with premium you will still earn about six thousand rp this is rediculous and makes grinding the main thing you play for horrendous two they have abandoned the air for the game which is what the game was founded upon three the ships closed beta is utter garbage and the gameplay is terrible and i believe they have abandoned it4 the new helicopters are an unfinished cash grab terrible flight models and damage models5 they refuse to keep fun and engaging gamemodes the enduring confrontation game mode is amazing but only shows up every so many months also their infamous world war mode is still in testing and in the past five months they have manage to make only very few advances in updating it i keep coming back to play this game because i have always loved it but after so many hours and money sunk in gaijin has not lived up to my expectations and i feel like they have abandoned this game
i heard about the game didnt realize it was free and was looking for something to play i saw this pop up and saw it was free remembering hearing pretty good things about it i decided to just play i decided i was going to just try to play mindlessly and go with a necromancer since that would let me play at my own pace and get to know the system when i felt like it since when you have your own small army doing all the work you can take your time and do whatever i have come to thoroughly enjoy the game and would say anyone starting out should try the same because you can still use magic if you want or not and you can use other weapons or not i found that being a necromancer of the three characters i have made thus far is the least punishing because you dont have as much need for strong gear or proper skill order it lets you ease into the game and try a lot of different things without having as much backlash for making what would be a mistake for another character type in the end i really like the game and will continue playing it and suggesting it to friends
disclaimer although it shows i played less then sixty hours on steam i have well over nine hundred hours outside of steam http i imgur com9r7mdrs jpggreat graphics great performance gameplay is awesome terrible balance bad match making incomplete game full of vehicles that behave like ufos i have played this game for more than two years waiting for their promised changes to take place only for developers to retract or outright lie in the begining they said the focus would be realism and historical accuracy but over the months more and more arcade elements were introduced and the realistic and simulator community completly on simulator community in particular is good as dead thanks to the complete negligence of developers they exploit broken content to get moneys and realese an endless stream of clone premium vehicles that add nothing to the game the worst moderating team and pr that i ever seen on any game ceo comes to forum and said some of the most stupid things ever to the playerbase it looks good it plays worse then wot when it comes to balance match making and net coding it is just a damned frustrating mess that shows no signs of clear direction or intent every patch they tinker with stuff and that was uncalled for it is clear they dont know what they are doing and they bit off more then they could chew patch after patch that is nothing more then content dumps most of which always badly balanced or unfinished and then takes three to four minipatches to get things to a minum acceptable level also they base their balacing around player statistics and that is why this game is hopeless in that respect gaijins motto we try fix what is not broken and instead break that also not worth the timeupdate as of ninety two thousand and sixteen this game is still a pile of garbage if you are planning to give a try stay on arcade mode and nothing else sb as been forsaken by devs and rb is a waste of time especially rb with planes you will waste twenty mintues hunting a enemy fighter so that then he drags the fight to his base and have the ai aaa kill you with super accurate fire this is not a game for those looking fair chalange p s tank battles are more cancerous now then in the closed beta enjoy getting spawn killed repeatedly as gaijin has no spawn protection mechanism and all maps are tiny and therefore easy for fast vehicles to exploit
this game is addicting and fun and always has you coming back on multiple weekends a month for event chests and lets not forget about the updates that take place around every holiday valentines day saint patricks halloween thanksgiving christmas winter and summer events also one more thing unity port coming soon
after many years and hours this will be a timeless classic till the end of days it has its flaws but makes up for those with endless charm and entertainment nothing but unconditional love for this game its like a slightly abusive relationship
early access reviewmuch more depth than a lot of the other online card gamesout right now having the ability to use the whole card pool instead of locked to class really opens up possibilites youre only really limited by how well your deck and whether or not you can support the resource requirements there is a ton of single player content to help you get familiar with the game from puzzles to a capaign and even its own draft like format rewards arent bad either so it may still be worth it if you have already got the handle of the game i have only two gripes with the game some cards are just blantantly pushed overloaded with abilities and stats that other cards just dont have some even to the point that in certain game states if you dont deal with the card as soon as its played you lose also the seventyfive card deck dize have a tendency to really screw over your draws both of these issues can lead to some non games where the chance you had to win is astronomically low another thing thats a not huge gripe but just odd is that the mechanics arent very well defined sometimes you have to play a card in a situation to see if it does wht you think it will i think a lot more clear card text could help while it does have a crafting system much like hearthstone it rewards you way more often not only do extra cards give you crafting material every pack you open gives you a decent amount too every win gives you a chest that gives you at least a common card and some gold good for buying everything aside form select cosmetics with a chance of giving more gold higher rairty cards never seen anything past rare with legednary being at the top or even packs these chests can also be gotten through daily quests special events and end of month ranked rewards every first win of the day gives a pack too there are cards that can only be earned by playing the campiagn purchasable with real money or in game gold that may be frutsrating for some players card art is meh very little of it looks intereasting and its probabnly because they dont have a ton of space to work with premium cards are just a basic filter or some distortion brining you own side of the board allows for some unique custoimization but its nothing really amazing to look at all in all i think its one of the best online ccgs we got out now and i hope they fix some of the issues to make the game really great
product received for freeearly access reviewby now im sure theres tons of reviews saying why this game is bad in its current state so ill be real quick here1 game doesnt require premium to play however you are gonna need it to minimize the moutain of grinding that awaits and thats with premium so imagine this game without it2 devs still havent fixed bugs that have been in the game for a long time and they dont seem like they are going to3 the only way to get the parts you want are to either get exceptionally lucky and get it in a crate and your gonna need more than one most likely so good luck getting more this way or grind more than you would in a mmo for crates that you then will take what you get out of them and deconstruct them for the bare mininum of points till you can finally get the part you want then do it a bunch more times cause youll only get fourteen a lot of the weapons are unbalanced they are either to weak to be viable or so strong that they will be almost all you will see in combat now currently the dev team says a rework of the crate system is coming i dont know if it will actually make things better i doubt it this current system is a money hungry and i doubt they will completely fix that but if you are considering playing this game id atleast wait till then however as of now i cant recommend it even slightly
incredible game tes legends has a great play style and is fun for all kinds of people its also a great game to play with a friend where you can batte eachother and make your own superior deck which u beleieve will destroy your friend usually resulting in you getting rekt but hey its still an incredible game best f2p game in this genre personal opinion
early access reviewmy only complant is there is no shooting range there needs to be a way other than playing to train your aim with the bullet drop off and all that sray patterns and such but i like the game alot and hope they keep emproving it
early access reviewwow where do i even start neowiz has had more than ample time to address some of the concerns with this game that have been plaguing it for years this was by far the absolute worst launch i have ever experienced and i own archeage diablo three and many others that go down in the history books for such the combat is an absolute joke this semilinear tab targeting combat system makes you feel like you have somewhat of a variety but in reality youll just be spamming the same two buttons constantly when i say spamming i mean youll hit r seven times and then it will finally use your chain skill there is an undeniable lag from the input to actual action that makes you feel like youre on dialup the ui is possibly one of the worst aspects of this entire game there are literally games from the late 90s with better and more customizable uis asherons call the realm online etc completely ignoring the fact it takes approximately nine hundred and seven tries to get the game to actually launch once youre in youre plagued with constant crashes graphics lag and other terrible graphics issues such as the game freezing for a few seconds just from opening your quests journal inventory or map as if it wasnt terrible enough at this point the game wont even support its advertised aspect ratiosresolutions if you choose the wrong settings on the launcher it will crash your game when you launch it the pure amount of technical issues with this game the absolutey poor response and acknowledgement of these issues on neowizs behalf and the fact that there are apparently no plans to address any of these issues is why i cannot recommend this game and i am requesting a refund literally fifteen stars
early access reviewtl dr game was ruined by money hungry devs who dont listen to thier fan baseok man this is hard to write lets start from the beginning imagine little baby me when i was ten finding a game where you could build robots and pit them against eachother in a arena my ten year old mind couldnt handle it i was freaking out it was the best thing i had ever found i played this game for a couple of years day and night thinking about what crazy design i could make when i got home from school i then went on a holiday with my family i came back and tiers had been removed that feeling of anticipation when you neared the next tier was gone i was pretty so i took a break from the game for a couple of months and when i came back armour cubes were gone no compensation for the hours and hours that i spent farming those ers no warning i soldiered on though and kept playing then the crates ooooooh the crates that was the last straw robocraft was no longer the game i fell in love with i write this review with a heavy heart and little faith in what is to come goodbye robocraft
another boring f2p idle game no sound no music system requirements are way off my hardware is below the requirements an i experienced zero issues besides the lack of fun just feels pointless even for an idle game
early access reviewi dunno how many cheaters there are but from what i heard with pubg the games wher we are forced to play with utsiders are filled with cheaters like the ones i did see jumping thirty feet in the air from the â â â â â â comment responses i see i assume the devs are attacking negtive reviews and i assume since they can do this the super jumper had on bunny shoes that must have been a dev wearing a dev created item and not a lowly modder he had amazing shots for jumpign up and down thirty feet over and over if i jumped out a second story window it would damage me slightly so he must have had unlimited health yeah so region lock the game and lock the devs out the servers xd
all you do is click in this game i setup my razer keyboard to left click for me repeatedly sure you get a small piece of satisfaction from building up coins but like thats all there is to this stupid game
hi guys i give this game a five starits great game just laggy some times and it has so many dragons to choose from although once you get toothless once your membership runs out i wish you could still ride him lots of good updates
yes what diablo four could be if blizzard got their act together basically plays like diablo two with a modern day mtx system for cosmetic stuff the layout is similiar to guild wars one in that you have mmostyle gathering hubs with instanced areas just for you and your group
"i love the realism of this game however i do not like the prices at almost one thousand, eight hundred for all of the dlc averaging ninety per plane ten per campaign which you have to have the plane for said campaign purchased and the list goes on the price tag is ridiculous"
solid game that keeps improving with a fantastic business model with no pay to win new systems and mechanics that think outdie of the box add lots of layers of progression and content on top of solid aprg farming mechanics currently the best arpg on the market without a doubt
as a long term heartstone player that quit a couple years back i find myself loving this game far more than i ever enjoyed hearthstone the meta in hearthstone has always heavily leaned on paying for the adventures even if you did have all the cards the gameplay just feels stupid compared to this game having the lanerune system in this combined with more reasonably statd cards makes it feel like more like a strategic card game and less like a race to the face i do not understand the mixed reviews as of late and hope this game is supported by the devs for a whileedit im level fifty and have many more hours than steam shows bethesda client and all
early access reviewvery fun with a really involved dev team that releases regular news and updates i got this game on the free weekend and absolutely recommend it even if its still alpha its exciting to see what theyre doing and where the game is going i have high hopes for the future
tf2 before and after the meet your match update before anyone could join a server really quickthere were free sandvichesthere were friendliesthere were partiesafter you have to wait in a queue just to join a single gameremoved quickplay sadlyif you are not a competitive type you have to play on community servers which there are a lot of adsi have to say the only thing good about this update is there is no autobalance anymore
playing a few ranked games every night gives me enough coins to do a few arenas on the weekends at this point getting cards i want is a slow grind but im having fun with my deck so its fine game is very addictive at first but after around one hundred and fifty hours im starting to get bored and looking for something else i wouldnt spend money on packs but i would happily buy more story campaigns
not sure if my negative review got posted was a really long one but ill just add why am i still playing this then idk very tiny glimpse of hope they get this game fixed up and done right that or im just outright bored to death its really not worth the time wasting or any money
this is a game that ive loved since i stumbled onto it it is an idle game but one that actually has a lot to do in the game and with the events its something that seems like it might have a whole lot more to come the humor is good and plays off of a lot of things the progression is interesting with both specific challenges to push you further and the general free play ones that just let you move forward in other ways this game keeps me playing daily for over a year now with several thousand hours in
early access reviewas you can see i have sank some time into this game so i hope you will put some stock in this review dont bother to play this game they have a p2w module that you can circumvent by regular play but it is an incredibly slow grind i enjoyed this game before this latest couple of patches i cant stand it anymore though i played medic when i first got the game and you were a welcome addition to any team a while back they gave stupid fast regen if out of combat for ten seconds and that eliminated the need for a medic because people just run away heal and come back i moved to plasma launchers which were a mass shot of exploding projectiles absolutely crap against nimble enemies high speed cars or jetflyers but anyone caught in the artillerylike blast was doom sauced it got turned into a rapid fire mini explosive that does next to nothing for damage i cant play this game anymore good luck to those that can but i cant be stuffed to even keep it installed anymore
well i used to play fallout shelter on my phone but all it ended up being is one deathclaw attack after another so i deleted the game so i decided to try the pc version and once again once you have a population of seventy everytime you log in it is a deathclaw attack followed by a raider attack followed by a mutant attack all right after logging in it has happened three times in a row after logging in and you spend the next thirty minutes trying to get the vault back in order each time it also make no difference what level your vault door is they just walk right through it so that is a waste of caps to even upgrade it the pc version will now get deleted since it isnt any fun trying to build up a vault if all you do is rebuild revive or repopulate after every log in
i have never heard of the new z before it coming out on steam and tried it out for the first time yesterdayfirst off i want to say this game is free meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to reviews you should play it and see if you like it or not for a free game its actually alright there are no pay to win elements what so ever except being able to buy premium which is like unturned premium yes you can buy meds and ammo for real life money but you can also do so with ingame money which is easy to get in my three hours i have well over one hundred and fifty grand which is more than twenty dollars can buy this game is mainly pvp with meds that have cool downs to use during fight barricades to block off bullets and a sweet arcade feel for combat that is not realistic at all killing zombies is quite rewarding as well and there is a skill gap in this game you can find clans that go in together and run parts of the map on servers so skilled gamers will enjoy this game remember this isnt a survival game but a shooter with zombies where you find loot like meds armor guns etc and then go to pvp thats the whole game but it is fun to play and free all negative reviewers are ing stupid or are rating this way to harshly overall seven hundred and ten fun to play with friends every now and then and free
not really very good when you shoot a guy thirty four times and he doesnt die because hes spent hours longer than you its not a good fps what sort of advanced kevlar does this guy have that allows him to take thirty four thirty caliber bullets to the chest turn around and shoot me with his submachine gun play team fortress for the realism vs heroes generals its not really worth the time
in duel links konami really has thought about what makes a great mobile game and how to make yugioh work on mobile its also gone about creating a game that has massive room for expansion and as such will hopefully be around for a long time to come duel links is even extremely generous with its ingame currency meaning most players will find themselves never having to spend to acquire new cards or to enjoy the game to its fullest if you love yugioh this is an easy recommendation however even if you don t then this is the perfect card game experience one wrapped within some of the best presentation you ll ever see
after playing this game since two thousand and fourteen i have to say that i love this game dearly this game has alot to offer as an fps possibly the best fps for pc not only that but this game takes skill alot of it so overall this is a fantastic game and i highly reccomend it
its a good game if u r willing to grind hours for cards or if u have a smartphone that has 5gbs free just need something to do while waiting for the ing bus that probably doesnt even come
early access reviewold school style mmo with an interesting tab target system ive never seen before has some optimization issues and a little ruff around the edges but a decent game from what ive seen its not the great game evar but its fair if you were to divide all the mmos into good or bad bless would be on the good side id recommend with the warning that its still sorting itself out
if you love outstanding physics intense tank battles realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay then you came to the wrong game welcome to war thunder please insert money to continue for some reason the developers seem to think russia and germany won wwii as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen ive done my best to enjoy this game but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing its somewhat impossible to do so ive seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble twelve year old xbox live children angry they cant get a kill however dont take this review as such the game requires some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable if you enjoy watching paint dry then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research but have no fear the waiting does not end there as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching but if that doesnt tickle your belly button then dont worry i have more good news those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players youre matched against who seem to be far above your level so the excitement of researching a bad tank is short lived as youre eiffel towered by tanks three ranks above you or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the pay two win tanks this includes having to take fifty shots at a single tank to get a penetration but if you drive over a rock prepare to spend fifty seconds to repairbut the greatest part about war thunder is their servers plenty of ping to go around the developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of endor as youll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map however if you do pay for premium your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research oh crap i ran out of premium already as their system charges you by day instead of the typical monthly payment be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your pc to keep your benefits coming because the moment they run out the game progresses slower than an african sloth trying to climb mount everest so grab your friends but not more than three because they limit your squad to four people and huff some glue because the amount of braincells youll sacrifice lose from doing that is miniscule to the amount youll lose to broken physics monkey run match making and confusing deaths walls dont wall properly in this game i recommend a spare keyboard as youll most likely bash your face against the keys a few times
found a deer didnt have the license to kill it broke the law five years prison much butt touching just kidding couldnt shoot it because my guy was scared of breaking the law you cant shoot anything without paying real money110 likenoreally
its alright a bit pay to win but we dont talk about that especially now when ive actually bought some stuff for real money btw i supermonkey wizard and banana tree bestâ â â â â
im just straight done with this game totally done here is the list why1 hackers even though the forums will deny up and down that they have seen a hacker in game for nigh two years or so they exist id almost bet the deniers are hackers when someone can take a machine gun one that should have the worst recoil and accurracy at distance and fires at a full speed moving jeep and one shots the full health gunnerwith heavy set medal at gold with a head shot from clearly away from easy sight the likelyhood of that just being a really skilled player is slim to none its totally bs2 dev bias the developers have a clear bias for certain factions regularly when a update comes out its for the german or soviet faction never the allied go ahead take a look find the last time they announced any kind of weapon or vechicle update highlighting something for the allied faction if you find it id bet its all the way back in early days of production and with that bias comes3 unbalanced factions you will regularly hear any allied player complain about being one shot with a gewer in the chest and yet it is one hundred impossible for any allied gun to return that favor the amount of pure damage guns outside of the allied faction can deal is unbelivable its rediculous and makes the game completly impossible hell you cant even get a decent scope for a sniper vehicles all have this same problem allied armor is weak in comparison last i checked thats not how the war went this used to not be as much of a problem a long while back when you could buy the weapons the enemy faction had as your starting weapon well they took that right the fk out now there is just a wall of bullets you better hope you can get around4 devs just dont care the devs are just cold and uncaring i had an issue where they did a big update and it wiped out all of my xp for my sniping gun i made a support ticket i think i waited three months till i actually heard something back by then i had uninstalled the game the devs response oh yeah we will fix that in a rolling patch later heres a camo skin for your trouble oh and the only unlocked it i still had to buy it with in game money this game should be ripped from steam just look at the mixed reviews even hardcore vets of this game are just done with the nonsense dont waste your life on this soon to be washed up studio and their cut rate biased game
this is such a good game i dont even have two hours played yet but i am already a quadrillionareone thing that is annoying is that the amount of coins i need for my first gem is rapidly going up faster than my production rate and i dont know whybut if you are looking for a good free game to download then get this
the best thing about this mmo is that you can totally ignore other people and play it as a singleplayer game this may also be its greatest drawback as there seem to be few opportunities for the social interactions that give other mmos a sense of story and belonging the most standout feature of realm of the mad god is its permadeath system but once you get deeper into it it turns out that it doesnt actually have permadeath rather than building up the character you are playing as realm of the mad god is actually about leveling up the little pokemon who follow you around the really good pokemon pets whatever we know theyre all actually pokemon are the ones that heal you and the best class to play as would be the necromancer whose attacks not only effectively damage enemies but also effectively heal your character once having unlocked the necromancer why would anyone play rotg as any other class rotgs class system suffers from the same problem as final fantasy vs job system there are a few kickass jobs you max out before too long and then a whole bunch of useless jobs you dont really need to bother with because what they offer is either too similar to what youve already got or else so specialized that they can rarely be utilized effectively anyway i cant recommend this as an mmorpg but i can recommend it as a casual game if youve got an audiobook to get through and want something mindless to grind away at while listening then realm of the mad god is the perfect mmorpg for you just ignore other players get some healing pokemon and be a necromancer
worlds okayest moba edit i quit the game and uninstalled beware the community is cancer worse most of the time youll be fighting your teammates in the chat rather than enemy gods on the field mute everyone and youll be fine
"early access reviewi have no idea why the dev released this game in this state its broken period weapons are not balenced serers are extreamly laggy the only redeaming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disatvantage was this game fun yes it was does that mean its a good game nogameplaythis game makes me think of counterstrike and cod had a baby and somehow that god aweful game combat arms also came in it plays alot like counterstrike you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points but the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights there is only one u s server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap now dont get me wrong i did enjoy some of the matches but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are unexseptable the maps feel bland you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action spawn camping is another big problem if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped soundthe game tends to be glitchy at times the guns also dont sound all that amazing the music you here when you start up the game is nice but after that is all guns and thats fine if the guns were nice to hear communitywith this being a pure online based game i have to adress community the community is there but its not booming i havent seen too much hacker name calling while in a game as of late but when thegame was first released it was somthing you saw alotfree or pay2winthis game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar but theres no gunsammoor anything that would make it pay two win what is there is slight cosmetic gear such as face pain and masks graphicsthe graphics are not anything new exciteing or all that special but they are not the worst i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good final verdictthis game is fun and with more work could be great but at its current state i just cant reccomend it the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own serversgames and let others join that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers the final verdict is a thirty seven thousand, five hundred and fifty okay"
this game is everything you would ever want in a video game a story of clicking on anime waifus death redemption and overall a story of romance when i first downloaded this game i expected nothing but after playing this game has changed my views on life i can walk on water i can fly and best of all i can love again10 out of ten this game will forever change you
early access reviewfunny to think that a free to play can be so much more responsive pretty graphically speaking and better developed all around than a game like pubg which might not be saying much considering pubg is a piece of garbage anyways this should hold out until blackout releases and hey holes its free
i would reccomend this game if you know at least the basics of flight and how to fly a plane but going in blind and using the tutorials that arent helpful at all make this game a nightmare remembering the controls is almost as difficult as flying the planes themselves
early access reviewhitoday i will make a review that i hope wont bother you too much this game is one of the most special games i have ever played on my pc the mechanics of the game i stunning as well as the graphics which are well optimised for amd gpu now that sound good i guess the problem is find with the game is the lack of realism and the control of the ships you should have the spaceship is stunning but the interaction with other ships and the outers pace environment is not that great the metorits are too easy to avoid and they are too big maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship now the next part is of course the game play now this is interesting because it was difficult for me to decide first of the loading times to find players is ridiculous but understandable for a game that is not a hit yet the interface inside a battleship match is not as user friendly as you might expect but it is okay the game is actually not boring at all but fun as heck you can enjoy one game of fractured space and it will feel like you played for ten hours this is good for those gamers who dont have more time than one hour a day to play games now last problem i have is with people that are afk there should be a system that bans them after theyre kicked from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour i would say that this game is worth playing you can enjoy the game without putting a penny in buying the great editions of the game i would give this game a six hundred and ten this is pretty good score for a free to play game enjoy the game and thank you for taking your time to read this
product received for freeearly access reviewafter the recent update all obtainable robot parts come from crates which is purely chance i got a legendary yellow weapon from a rusted crate and ive never gotten above a blue from gold or higher crates its bull parts dont sell for enough to make obtaining things in a reasonable amount of time remotely possible i started playing with a lvl eightyeight promocode and luckily i had lots of good stuff from this patch but for new players it will take them months of nonstop play every day to get anythin good and its unbalanced as hell
infestation the new z seems good im not a pro in survivalpvp games but heres my review title infestation the new z developer fredaikis ab publisher op productions llc fredaikis ab release twentytwo november twenty sixteens graphics 3d genre pvp price freetoplay rating six hundred and ten the game this game is an openworld zombie survival mmo with a heavy focus on pvp infestation the new z is an official reedition of infestation survivor stories a zombieapocalypse survival mmo pvp game as its predecessor it is set in colorado and california the new z is the third edition of a zombie survival game that has been released several times gameplay infestation have a large openworld map where you can explore abandoned towns and cities and trek through desolate mountaintops and national parks while scavenging for supplies the graphics seems pretty nice they seemed soft and work well with the other players and zombies the new z offers beginner and warmup servers so new players can more easily get acclimated to the harsh environment or you can try your luck on battle royale servers pitting a number of survivors against each other in closequarters death matches community features make it easy to find your friends and you can create a clan for safety in numbers you need to be prepared to engage in actionpacked pvp almost anywhere in the map arm yourself with a variety of weapons from sniper rifles to frying pans its easy to get a gun in a few minutes i got three while i played the game runs well and i didnt see any problem just some fpss oscillation but nothing too big this leads me to think that the game is relatively well optimized bugsaspects need to be improved however there are some bugs e g sometimes there are crashes of updating the scenario or characters the items go beyond the walls which for me is severe because it can compromise a whole game someone can be discovered in a hiding place because of this needs a quick fix one thing i didnt realize is how the character runs so slow there are a lot of zombies and you run slowly and you still have to slow down to regain stamina this could be improved positive points free good interface design large openworld map an enjoyable variety of guns and melee weapons theres a lot of servers to choose from you can get in to a superpopulated one or try to go it alone private servers rent passwordprotected servers to play solo or exclusively with friends mlg anticheat the game is protected by an anticheat engine developed exclusively for the game negative points bugs need to be fixed like the crashes when updating the scenario unbalanced giant zombies they can stay alive after three explodes and two hundreds bullets from machine gun the world is big and you run slow and you have to take breaks to regain stamina it can take a long time to get from one place to another and most of the spaces between zones are completely zombiefree and lootfree so just big stretches of holding the run button watching your stamina drain so much time devs arent the best and maybe four years from now well still be reporting the same bugs good game to play with friends as it alone can be hard
you could get bored in an instant when u finally get ur cars alot amount of stuff or even games currency pvp come on it didnt gives u a money and no ones will grabbin all of their stuff to bag if ull lost ur stuff when someones killed you overall five hundred and ten without a friends it will just be a waste
name
early access reviewthis is the first game ive taken the time to review because i am so excited for the potential it has yes another br but i love everything about it so far i hated the building and cartooneyness of fapnite pubg hadhas too many issues this is a great balance of realism and the devs have been listening to suggestions excited to see where it goes from here
when i first played this game i was a bit confused on how it works but the more you play it slowly gets more and more eary and creepy with little popup jump scares and it progresses to being chased i do for sure recommend this game only one small issue bug was being chased and trying to go through doors i sometimes got stuck but other then that small bug it is very fun
early access reviewthe game was a lot better back in twenty fourteens but the development team are amatuers at best failure to learn from their mistakes and there are many which has been proven again and again over the two years of updates ive suffered playing this game match making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players the outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design the problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in twenty fifteens battle arena update which broke the game overclocking mechanic and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times the removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together this relates to the poor match making mega bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve failure to add key features for the community like clans this could make the game if they bothered to implement itthey treat the playerscustomers with little consideration when they release major changes often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws they only care about new players who spend real money membership exists but it offers such poor value i suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer if you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility the most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item the items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price effectively you can grind the free to play model convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new cratesitems for real money at extortionate rates they have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players this game is now looking more like free to install and pay to compete
well i been playing this for a couple of hours now so i ready to tell you what i think for the a free to play game im impressed you start off with four ships all seem good enough to get the job done you can earn more as you play prices seem reasonable the game play is casually competitive with some ship roles that change the way you tatically need to think the ships comes along with your own crew that provides minor bonuses to it seems this crew is some how customizable but i have yet to get a new member the game has a reward system for play up to six matches a day every match you play earns you credits to buy new ship as far as the pvp matches go they seem balanced and most the time pretty close or right down to the wire i have yet to play a match that i have just wanted to surrender has coop vs ai if you like that rout all in all for free to play this game i would recommend it and even think of a future purchase cause of how the game is structure to make it ends meet so if you like space action ships and a team based game then give it a try
this is an interesting concept im still not completely sure of the point besides upgrading yourself and getting allies and clicking as many times as possible also the trading card feature is odd as a freetoplay game trading cards are only awarded for spending money in game there are not enough dlc content to acquire the usual half you should considering that it takes nine to earn one still it is a good time waster and it is free at least at the basic model
if you havent played clicker heroes first and havent played a clicker game then go try that one before using this one this is a clicker game thats also like a tactics game it is fun too but i think it gets stale to a certain point as does all clicker games
played this game for a few hours im kind of a casual mmo player who enjoys stories lores and exploration im not so much into pvp so far im enjoying the game im up to lvl twentyfive now and its been pretty easy maybe too easy theres a lot of weird mechanics like if u pick up some special loot chest you need to pay real money to open them however those loot boxses seems to only give out cosmetic drops which arent really needed beginning at lvl twentyfive youll start reaching the limit on your inventory space im not sure if you can buy bags with gold coins but i dont think you can over all the game reminds me a bit of the old golden mmo days its fun to play but i probably wont play the end game after reading that it will be a money pit however i may spent some on invetory space or subscription as a courtesy to the game developer since i did enjoy the game a bit i prefer subscription model over p2w model
early access reviewbest battle royale game ever and its free to play i have played pubgfortniteh1z1last man standing and by far this is my favorite oneit has some different things from other battle royal games i suggest you highly to try itwhen u start playing you wont be able to stop im fn addicted to it ddidnt see any cheaters for now great gameplay and not bad optimization1010 hope to see this game grow and some tournaments in future
early access reviewi am done with this once a promising game now screwed up from everywhere i dont even get what is the goal anymore its like removing the soccer ball from a football game devs are hungry for money more than they should be the last few updates ruined the game first removed robitsgalaxycash2nd removed megabots3rd removed tiers4th added tons of useless crates why not pay real money for the best crate for a chance to win legendary and epic stuff when a noob can sit afk and still have the same chance right five totally messed up matchmaking no words x6 removed the i dont even know how to say this anymore gamemode and now i dont even know how to play this in conclusion once a great game now ruined by its own creators hungry for money i strongly do not recommend this to anyone except those who want to lose their time and money
early access reviewwas the awesomenes construction simulator two thousand and fourteen that is what this game was note that im a tier nine and have just recently played this game to update my review i have built m35 mako from mass effect 1m44 hammerhead from mass effect 2ut47a kodiak from mass effect three terran diamondback from starcraft two terran ar e mercenary siege tank yes the siege breaker from wings of libertybut none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established the weapons continuously nerfed until being six feet under rewards being lowered with improvments to the system and a plethora of other problems back in early twenty fourteens i strongly i repeat strongly supported this game strongly i emphasize this say it with me strongly supported this game but with every step forward freejam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time clone warsso lets first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start this included the hoverblades plasma launchers railguns and thrusters from level one upward of level three yes this happened freejam didnt change this until seven months later when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back double edged butt erynow prior to this they also made some modifications to the reward system adding a repair function to the game which put a drain on casual players tiers six and up back then what was the kick in the balls here a twenty five decrease in rewards yes both rp and tp robopoints and techpoints hero zero next up was the hero system which allowed you to get the full rp and tp from a match you died in if your team won but wait at the cost of the entire reward system getting another twenty five decrease at this point managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle and at a fifty reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day its been a massive pain in the turn up for hatenow next up they remove repair cost yet yet again another freaking reward quantity decrease you getting the pattern yet dont worry ill explain it in a second at this point it got rediculous but oh no theres even more from intense to indensethis game was always a onelife team death match game the respawned and overclocked update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused moba wannabe even worse is that theyve now set the original mode now named classic so far on the back burner it can take from five minutes to three hours just to get on a match gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up but heres the final blow to the old mode a eighty decrease at this point to the profit you make from it classic is now as worthwhile as dumping your in a toilet or on a development team think thats the worst part oh no im not even finished what is wrong with my ing keyboard the controls with any movement design other than tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask yeah thats right the subtitle of this paragraph as of the ro update wheels are incredibly sluggish rockets provide minimal momentum hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even one aerofoils are a disaster to use walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place and believe me its going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot and lastly the rotor blade design is sluggish as well this genuinely brings my pss to a plasmatic boil the challenge should not be in handicapping the ing player give us ur monieswhy all the reward debuffs because they want money they want to force the playerbase to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate this game never did have a fair free to play model but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief and also no its not even classified as pay to win its pay to ing progress give us ur monies 21the introduction of easy anti cheat or eac instead of using steams vac system which worked very well and still mostly does made no sense either they decided to use a third party system that not only people have always secondguessed but never trusted and never been comfortable with you see where this is going yeah they drove off a number of their player base stating if you cant get into robocraft to play because of eac that is a small price to pay for the issue of hackers trying to ruin our game the only people who tried to help fix this was eac themselves as i recall and even then only under the pressure of the robocraft community which had already started leaving give us ur ferkign muneez11elevenwhy did eac have to fix it because freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves aside from the matter of the development companys profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place but it doesnt even end there they wont respond to crticism kindly light or dark which is why im not sugarcoating this not even an ounce they wont listen to reason no matter how kindly you put it if they dont like your you better be prepared for the ban hammer because they silence any and all feedback that involves any kind of actual review with a vengeance and hell this hasnt even ended yet keep reading this is starting to look like the robocraft holocaust shudder nerf em to the gravenow the final kick to the balls here and you might not get up from this one is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff finally theres the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete promoting the uncreative design of gun bricks with tank treads and tank treads only ill give an example from speedy to needyi made a vehicle called the masterkill bstard frankly cant put the word itself in which operated on two things wheels downforce and rocket asssisted forward momentum as of three days after the ro update my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a treaded tank and thats with the thrusters on i guess people cant stand having to exercize their arms hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their railguns and enjoy the game because this actually happened without rockets its even slower than a tank believe me ive tested this one the day i learned of the horror inflicted on the physics engine which i think its safe to say its nearly nonexistant now final thoughtslastly like i said i strongly strongly supported this game hell i even put ten into this game just for hangar bays but as of now freejam has botched their game so much yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly that it is nighunenjoyable this game had so much potential a year ago but now its all been dried up freejam has made it evidently clear they dont want to take a step in the right direction a year ago id give this game a ninety five out of ten but as of now i can only in good conscience give it a four out of ten a toxic community confused development team nonsensical gameplay poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a doubleedge to updates and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was all in the name of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this stay away from this hideous deformed child of a game you will be stricken with its godsawful moba wannabe gameplaymore on my review in the comments section
great game with good mechanics loads of vehicles great graphics and sound the problem is that the developers think games should be work not fun even paying for a premium account and owning premium vehicles it would take you thousands of hours to get to the end of the tech tree and at some point it just isnt fun anymore
total and utter ing garbage people running this game should just quit there jobs and give this game to people who know what there freaking doing the optimization is horendous and the game is recording and ing with my computer i havenever been so off at a game client before i was able to get on create my char and then go afk for a bit come back to my compueter being hacked in some way like they had control of it and the game all messed up like really pls hand this game over to people who actually knwo what there doing shall i also mention how it takes an hour to open and when it does it crashes constantly unistalling bye bye noobs
i have played lockon and flaming cliffs years ago now we have dcs world and more aircrafts to fly with more coming you really have to know how to fly and navigate or this is not the combat sim for you others who compare this to arma3 or other arcade games need to get a life this is a combat sim not a xbox controller game there is very steep learning curve and you really need to rtfm and do the training missons to know how to use everything in the aircraft i fly the a10c ka50 and huey alot i do have many years of flight sim experience so flying them is no issue with me i do recommend this to any combat simmer that has had real flight sim flying and or is a real pilot looking for sim combat fun
early access reviewvery fresh approach to moba genre with popular cosmetic micro transactions system absolutely no pay two win easy to get into but hard to master also very competitive and visually stunning worth trying out big thumbs up
a really great game i would love to donate to these wonderful people and spend all my time playing this game this is so awesome its such a great family game me and my sistermother and little brother had a lot of fun d
i have been trying to rearrange my deck many times but they were all useless since pvp ing real human always use the same badass deck ing furhair amazon aroma or what the ing else that might be thought as the undefeatable deck by those men this is kinda lame because it is not fun at all if you dont have any cards that have ingdaamn effects or traplike things you gonna lose for sure what the heck if they are in reality i swear to god im gonna tear down those ing cards you es all should be my irritation but okay you dont have to play it if you are poor dont have any money to spend for the gems for purchasing the cards you konomi good bye as the last time for me to playing this thrash ps the only little thing that i like about this game is characters songs and a little bit of some events but for duel carnivals i think its totally unfair like they dont pick the players to fight in balance rookie rank was picked to fight with the platinum who already own the ing hell deck please fix for your gaming balance unless there would be more decreasing of players except those fools who have ing deck bye you again x
basically same as all card games sadly nothing that different i got bored with story thankfully was fast forward on most of it i have crashing issues with it constantly have to click cards to get them to register to do anything was rather annoying for me
unless you have plenty of money to spend you cannot compete with other players check out websites of best decks all cost money or many months of playing to make one deck i dont mind spending the cost of a game twenty to forty if the game is free but this game is a cash cow spend lots to get best decks and game introduces new cards so you can spend loads more within five years games like this and most others at the moment will be illegal
a great game as the title suggests its full of jumpscares i cant describe how fun this game is to play with a friend whos just as afraid of horror as you are pros free addictive fun to play alone in the dark or with friends in the dark cons kinda short
thank you for destroying the game of dota you suck the only good part about this game were the graphics if you were an old school dota player then you are better off playing league or smite at least those are free and in my opinion better than dota two do not waste your money on
early access reviewi love this game so much and i like the fact you listen too the community as well i would give this a nine hundred and ten there is a few things a dont like here is the list1 i unlocked the grease gun as infactry didnt buy it when i switched to a tank crewman i had to unlock it again which i dont think i have to do since i aready did2 it says tank crewman can use a semiauto rifle but it wont let me use my m1 garand3 i dont like the repair system i like realism in a game but that takes it a bit far the reason i say this is beacause some battles a die a bit use some gernades ect and at the end i can get twenty four thousand credits but with repairs i dont get much back sometimes i lose money so i suggest either remove it or make it so it doesnt cost as much4i think you should increase the amount of gold you get a day you would have to do one battle a day for twenty days just to get one hundred gold and some people just dont have that time so i suggest you increase it to ten gold per first battle so it cuts the time in half5 i can feel the unbalance in battles it seems the germans have too many tanks and the soviets have to many half tracks i know you guys are working on this and i am grateful for that i think it should be like this the germans have good tanks but not much of them harder to get the americans should have ok tanks but plenty of them easier to get like how it really was in world war two as for the soviets i dont know i dont know what they had in ww2other than these few things i really enjoy the game and i hope you kepp on improving and updating the game nine hundred and ten ign would definatly play again
early access reviewabsolute i have been playing this game since two thousand and fourteen not via steam because its nine hundred hours on the clock the game has been killed by the defs if you are new do not bother playing this game veteran players will gankfarm you as easy kills with their fully modded weapons and golden badges you are no more than canon fire even as a vet myself it is a absolute ing frustrating nightmare leveling new soldiers especially on the usa side it a horrible experience and not fun at all the grind for levels and weapons and their mods are insane these days unlike two years ago where it was still manageable germans are the safest bet and easierst as they got the most real money investers veterans soviets are a second bestus are mostly freeloaders noobs and are painfully often the underdog against both soviets or germans you will get massively frustrated guranteed do not think you will come far with a ironsight weapon everything is so scoped up that you have to use a scope because everyone is a sniper in this game tanks have a massive zoom and are often sniping he from mountains i kid you not your stock iron sight weapon is a freaking joke this game has moved away from the classic ww2 themed games and instead go for their own cod style interpertation with scope options for nearly every weapon even the weapons never used in ww2 at all you will be disappointed and frustrated with this game period
early access reviewwhen the game first start out it is nice gun are easy to get as in the cost of buying the gun are cheap but after tons of patch this game only have one rule in devs mind give me your fking money the game dev is greedy fker they make the cost of gun so high that it will take age to get one gun yes one fking gun well not just guns tank plane etc so u may think that after all the time grinding for the money needed for the gun mod will be cheap hell no other fking pay wall so a gun cost like 10k the starter once the gun mod it cost around 5k or up if u want to have a nice one oh gun mod dun last u need need to repair them so yeah im done with this crap pay to win game
early access reviewthis game is perfectly designed and its easy to play tho but its under the early access so we gonna see a lot of updates so be patient if u kinda hate that wait till it complte all
early access reviewa very solid game that borrows heavily from magic the gathering with the user friendly ui hearthstone spearheaded the game is easy to pick up if youve come from other cardgames and the tutorial and puzzles are there to teach and reward those who have never played cardgames in a fun and effective way depth is great as well decisionmaking and order of execution end up mattering a lot more than early tempo so the better player does end up coming out on top a lot more than in most other online ccgs a big barrier to entry in a cardgame is cost and boy does this game nail that by the time i was done beating most of the single player content id already cobbled up two of the tier one decks at the time because everything you do is rewarded in gold or packs no daily limits on earnings no copouts when fighting the ai in gauntlet free arena runs vs ai not to mention you get to keep all of the cards you pick in your drafts and arenas it will always reward the time you spend on it no matter what and it makes for a very welcoming new player experience a great place of refuge for those tired of the increasingly frustrating randomness of hearthstone or those who have graduated from it and crave something more complex
surprisingly great game at least for an oldschool arpg lover like myself for me it outperforms d3 main competitor on todays arpg market in every possible way needless to say ive already spent one hundred hours in poe and it seems that this number will significantly increase over time pros dark atmosphere its way darker than most games nowadays i dig it well balanced of course there are things that are still arguable plenty of choise i mean plenty you can build really crazy character that still doesnt suck even on third difficulty real freetoplay no p2w at all completely even char slot count and stash size are quite fine by default game evolves over time new skillsuniquesbalance tweaks every month act four in development all of this free of charge of course cons desync on third difficulty with ten exp death penalty it can be pretty annoying particularly for the melee charsclasses i wont be explaining this problem a lot here just google it theres plenty info out there
early access reviewi really like this game i have poor hardwere and it runs better than vanila minecraft game it self is in early access stage has very good future and it is free dp s i have xp windows and single core cpu
i would say one positive thing about this game and that would be that playing this game allowed me to learn that the only way to earn card drops in free to play games is by spending money on them something i absolutely refuse to do for this game it infuriates me to no end that there is enough of a demand and market for these kinds of nongames that this even exists i just dont get how people want to stare at a screen while they click rapidly in order to achieve so little let alone in a variation like this where you quickly become so ineffectual at clicking that it turns into an idle game that it tries to turn a profit for doing so little by making this into an adult game is a travesty but people are tossing some money their way that it was probably worthwhile for them to do makes you wonder why you even bother working a normal job when you can get paid to make something like this which im sure is a programmers wet dream of simplicity thats about as close to being sexually interested in this game as ill ever get
"it is a very good game although i think that tanks with high single shot damage such as the is or the kv2 on their ap rounds should have the chance of when you hit the enemys track by mistake for example there would be a chance of hitting the tank too due to the pieces of metal when the shell hits the tank the small pieces could be able to penetrate the hull and deal at least two thousand, five hundred and forty five of the damage"
early access reviewi reccomend this game it was so cute and fun at first but then i wanted to quit at the fact that the cuteness quickly goes away completely and you are left with eleven different monsters that want to either eat you take your soul or just plain kill you please play this game
early access reviewyou cant join a dungeon with a friend even though it says party dungeon the worst of the worst stay away from this horrible game the music still haunts me to this day
its a very chill arcady game where you run away from monsters in randomized rooms with the monsters having special effects to make running away hard surprisingly fun and can be actually scary for some people
answer me this why do you not have this game yet you dont even have to buy it just go ahead and click that download button now its right up there just one mouse click go ahead
although many have complained about the game not being free enough i dont find it an issue at all the game is still in development and needs some polishing but the game is playable by all means and five hours in i have not seen any game breaking bugs about the arguement over free to play i remember a time when free to play didnt exist when it came to top notch technology games with multiplayer capabilities this is someones job to create this game surely they deserve compensation for their work do they not they game can easily be played without spending any cash but the whole buisness model as for any other free to play game is for the player to buy exclusive items in the ingame store i cannot think of any free to play games with so many options and gametypes that doesnt have an ingame store so ignore all of these negitive reviews about the game not being free enough download and install this unique game and have a gaming expierence that you wont find any where else for free
it s not a good fallout game and it s not a good mobile game eithermy tldr recommendation is don t bother too much micromanaging to enjoy vault lifemenus needed a lot more polish before porting to pcloading screens are longgood god having people attack your vault is annoying category score plot two hundred and ten gameplay four hundred and ten graphics seven hundred and ten soundtrack ten replayability ten overall two hundred and ten plot 210if you come into this game expecting gameplay choices like you do in fallout prepare to be disappointed keeping in mind that this was originally a mobile game a medium that traditionally lacks the ability to dive into lore there s very little to learn about the world of fallout interactions with outside characters are thrown in amongst hours of tedium and impacts on the world are longlasting this game will leave you wondering why the hell do i care about this vault again also there s no endgoal so you re just grinding for the sake of grinding gameplay 410starting from a mobile game and porting to pc there was so much opportunity to improve on the basic formula many of the menus are very clunky and leave you clicking in and out my biggest grievance the bigger your vault gets the more you have to scroll out to manage your dwellers at the macro level unfortunately the hitbox or clickable area for almost all clickable objects in the game might not line up with the sprite if you re anything like me you ll end up having a lot of wasted clicks that pile up as minor annoyances into a gargantuan garbage heap a big improvement would have been menus or buttons for autoassigning dwellers actually no my biggest grievance is when your vault gets attacked you can only assign two dwellers to guard the door and the invaders will run right past them the rest of your dwellers just walk along or twiddle their thumbs while the vault is being torn to and you can t get dwellers even the ones assigned to the entrance to follow the invaders around also during the duration of that event you cannot let in new dwellers or get your old ones back from the wasteland very irritatinggraphics 710it did start as a mobile game and in keeping with the medium the style is cartoonlike and keeps with the quintessential spirit of fallout with all of its anachronisms and art influences it can be difficult to differentiate dwellers unless you assign standard outfits which will take a long time to collect to specific rooms ex all of the dwellers working in the hospital wearing labcoats dwellers working out wearing fatigues etc as a result of manygenerational breeding in my vault almost everyone has dark skin and dark hair they are very difficult to tell apart and due to the menu system sucking it leads to a lot of confusion the graphics aren t great but i suppose they could be worse soundtrack 010i don t actually remember music playing during the game except small cues when i accomplished something could be a bug i suppose the jazzy classic soundtrack of fallout three and four forget it you re not getting any of that here also points off for having blaring alarms while your vault is being attacked it s annoying after the first two minutes and you will be hearing it a lot over the course of the game replayability 010i haven t completed this game while i do have all of the rooms unlocked and built i find the progression to be very empty it s not rewarding and a lot of mechanics that should have been addictive fall flat because of the aforementioned awful menu system there s a lot of micromanaging involved and with one hundred dwellers it just becomes a massive pain in the overall 210i enjoyed this game for the first hour that i played it and kept playing out of a love for bethesda this isn t a good fallout game and it isn t a good mobile game either also though my computer is a bit outdated i have a gtx two hundred and sixty in my box i figured a mobile game should run very quickly not true there are still decently long loading screens when exploring the wasteland and making changes to the vault i would expect a game with such simplistic graphics programming and mechanics to run much faster even on old machine gamespecific commentsin the shortterm you might enjoy this game but in the longterm you will probably experience frustrations with the menus hitboxesclickable areas and loading times if you want to support bethesda put money into one of their games that has more than an hour of play in it hope you enjoyed my review of fallout shelter if you liked it please upvote
this game used to be great until it got released now it has taken away half the stuff i worked hard for and was given to by the devs thought random loot boxes i spent sixty hours to get that my friend who has played over two hundred hours has had the same thing and its more like why give people stuff just to take it awayit will be fine for new members but old ones got ripped off
anyone know how the hell to fix the checking for new updater bug at the launch of the game it goes through many tries try one two three etc but in the end it doesnt launch instead it just comes up with a message that it failed to connect with update server help
really cool game if you liked the movestv show it features several species both from the movies and show my only gripes are that several species specific diet and abilities arent in the game and that you have a species specific quest like the monstrous nightmares ability to light itself on fire the nadders spine shot and the typhoomerangs eel diet the species specific quest involves hovering and the only dragon that can hover is a gronkle so in order to complete that quest you need a gronkle this penalizes players who dont pay for gems and didnt choose a gronkle as their starter dragon this could upset players that dont have the money to spend on a virtual game but want to complete all current quests also you get a free whispering death in a later quest so dont spend your money on getting an egg
product received for freeearly access reviewso im a doctor in behavioral medicine and on my questionnaires that i give to people who play this game to determine their sanity i ask them do you like loot crates and would you recommend this game if people answer yes theyre maniacs and will need straitjackets on them immediately they pose a threat to society we will throw these people into soundproof cells and they will have multiple armed guards and scientists watching them but in all seriousness as a guy that spent more than one hundred on this game with loot crates please dont youll never be able to get the items you want unless youre really lucky and get them somehow
early access reviewearly impressions are wonderful custom games are even more enjoyable than the matchmaking ranked seems to be really tactical in 2v2s only thing i hope to see in the future are larger maps each legend feels fairly balanced and can be counter with a few changed tactics i highly suggest gathering friends up for nonsense hope to see brawlball get its own queue at some point 3v3 brawlball would be pretty amazing worth a download if you enjoy smash bros or castle crashers
this game is a blocky 3d aventuring game a bit like minecraft but with a bit less to do dont get me wrong there is still a lot to do tho its a simple game which is nice for casual players edit queues are mostly gone you can get in very easily now
so ive unintentionally played this for five hours today yes its like minecraft but its better in just about every way imaginable the crafting system is better the tool system is better the movement system is better the sounds are way better the only thing i find that is not better is the constant reminders to upgrade to pro thats pretty annoying its a big advertisement i expect i eventually will get pro because unlike minecraft i expect this game will go on sale at some point also twenty is a pretty decent price id like to hear some more reviews on the pro aspect before spending the money though for now its a very fun freetoplay minecraft2
its trash and p2w great combo played this back twenty fourteens or so when it was in early access and it was pretty good now its just a bunch of kiddies going pew pew and whoever pays the most wins the most this games path went down the samer road like heroes generals was great when it first came out but its p2w and so is this if you want to try it out go ahead but dont get sucked in because while building ships is fun whoever has the best cannons and the most of that best cannon is the one to win that firefight just another free to play dumbed down trash game for mindless five year olds
used to be my fav game of all time but with the new waityourmatch update i feel i cant play this game anymore now i know why tf2 youtubers started uploading overwatch videos more often than tf2 videos this game used to be one of the best games on steam now everyone is quitting it also i miss u mrpaladin used to watch ur guides now he quitted tf2no thumbs up for u valve until u fixed casual bringbackpubs and quickplay those good good ol days are gone
я потратил five часов своего времени на поиски оленя за это время я встречал разных животный которых не мог застрелить тк не было лицензии в общем игра подобна таким как warface и копатели онлайн без доната не выжить
"this game is quite fun but there are loading issues i have had to close the game several times due to this loading issue the quest missions and character menu lags and breaks sometimes but despite these glitches and lag issues i look at what the game offers it sorta is a cash grab but there are fun thing in this game fireball frenzy is fun and the dragon races are fun as well flight club isnt really that hard be careful with what you spend your coins on always have at least ten bait just in case you run out of fish and coins the lab is cool as well you do learn about materials and what combines with what and what happens to certain materials on certain things as of seventy one thousand, two hundred and sixteen the game is constantly crashing for meoveral7910 scorethe game would benifit from better graphics and for it to be a game and not a course in the sciencesstill enjoyable thoughi have no loading screen issues but the game probably has bad coding or should i say one hundred chance of bad coding bestpc2016"
early access reviewhaving played mtg for lots of years hearthstone and recently dabbling into gwent i can definatly recommend this game to any ccg tcg player the econmy in the game is very very generous compared to hearstone co and its possible to build a competitive deck within a week of playing without investing a single cent in the game you basically get a free pack every day for your first win and earn gold and cards from chestsfor every following win there is even the chance that the chests you get upgrade and earn you even more gold cards or packs the gameplay is very reminsicent of mtg which is no wonder considering that a lot of mtg greats like lsv or patrick chapin work on this game there are several game modes where you can play either against other players or the ai you can can play simple one on one draft forge sealed against the ai and there are events that are only open for a limited time and have specific rules for either gameplay or deckbuilding its even possible to grind for gold against the ai which makes it even easier to build a solid collection the game is decently balanced and there is a lot of variation on the ladder going on last but not least reaching the masterrank in eternal is by far not as big as a grind as reaching legend in heartstone or grandmaster in gwent and isnt just spamming a lot of games if youre sick of the rng and grind in hearthstone the pirces in mtg or the current state of gwent i can wholeheartly recomend this game to anyone who loves and plays ccg tcgs
early access reviewthis game sucks now the devs removed the megabots they added epic loot which is basically s loot this was the best f2p game i my opinion and now it s ruined
i will be straight with you chief this game is a monopoly rip off nonetheless this game is incredibly fun and entertaining to play with your friends be wary tho this game will ruin friendships nonetheless we boolin boy xd worth every penny bless up
early access reviewbefore starting this review lets keep in mind it is early access and label some of the bugs i have encountered bug one while going down certain slopes at high speeds while on the snowboard you can freeze and start lagging in place bug two while trying to perform a weapon swap and then immediately doing another action your weapon wont actually switch bug three vehicles moving at high speeds will glitch and teleport on your side of view compared to the smooth movement of the player actually driving now onto the good side of the game1 the game is fairly simple to grasp and understand2 the game itself offers a casual and competitive hairstyle to approach3 you are able to physically choose your spawn location than wasting about two minutes sky diving and praying you pick up a weapon firstand now the bad side1 since the circle gives your a freeze effect on your screen and tints the ring a blue hue it can be fairly difficult to cope with players camping the outside of the storm2 since bullet drop doesnt seem to exist just from what ive seen it might be a slight bullet drop trying to avoid gunfire while in the open really doesnt work at all3 directional sounds in the game are alright for now but dont expect a refined and top of the line sound functionall in all if you want a fun and casual battle royal that isnt super competitive pubg or inconsistent rng based fortnite this game is definitely a good choice
ign approved 1010after i playd this game i thought my life was not complete i was scroling through the free games and i seen the word sakura i screamed with pleasure and installed it i seen the game did not work for a month but i am determined to play this game for i feel like it is the key to my future it started to work so i get my lube and clicked furiously while fapping off my the skin flew everywhere as blood covered the hole of my hand unfortunatly at that moment my dad walked in and said to me youre a dissapointment so i jerkd off more blood flew onto my computer and blew the socket so i went onto my dads computer installed the game and kept fapping to my hearts content now im twenty years old still fapping to sakura clicker my sore from the moan of anime charecters being slain by my feriouse boobs later on i sent this game to osama binladin the date was 911and well we all know how that ended
one of the best free to play games ever but its developers are absolute scum theyre rude greedy and just dont really give a damn about their community getting new vehicles takes wayyy too long the core gameplay hasnt been changed in years and for some reason ww2 era tanks will be up up against tanks built twenty years later for a game that claims realism it sure is historically innacurate i mean im no history expert but im pretty sure bombers didnt fly off on their own without formation despite the communitys pleas for change in gameplay the developers simply continue adding more vehicles to the game and charging you sixty for them go play another game and dont waste your time
this game is great it inculdes a full game with a retro feel witch is great for anyone who played with the old consoles this game is comparable to old titles with a up to date graphics and soundthis game is just an all around great game to have and to play in your spare time
early access reviewi have played this game for seven hundred and one hours and two years now ive tried this game competitively i have reached the highest ranks as far as my region goes ive spent close to fifty dollars on this game here is what i think of this game brawlhalla is one of those games that you will tremendously enjoy its got several different game modes competitive casual and private options for multiplayer its got a training room which has expansive options for learning how to play the game this game has one of the best developers working behind it they even have their own esports department and tournaments are featured on the main menu frequently loads of options that you can have when playing this game free to play you will have fun playing this game if youre looking to play casually spend maybe sixty great intense hours with your friends download this game if this applies to you however to the forty of the population who wants to try this game to reach the top read on playing ranked is whole different game although it has a great esports scene this game is severely broken and terrible at the high levels the main problem is this there is no punishment for running away what makes a fighting game a fighting game is that two opponents are essentially forced to battle out in an arena with intense action and adreneline everywhere however in brawlhalla at the highest ranks youre essentially trying to bait each other out and parry defensive play is the only option if you want to win the game let me put it this way a good story has a beginning conflict rising action climax and a resolution in brawlhalla although there is conflict its often either you chasing someone you losing to someone who waits for you to attack first or you doing the above there is no rising action so when a match finally ends is more like a flop this game will feel terrible and theres nothing you can do about it some weapons are incredibly overpowered as well the developers do not make a good attempt at trying to make all styles of plays and weapons viable like the disaster game which is league of legends theres always a pool of weapons and legends that are considered top tier before they are pulled off where as some weapons make reading very hard ten different options to escape and punish back some weapons feel like five thousand and fifty or you lose the entire game in essence brawlhalla is a fun an excellent game that should be played with many of your friends its almost guaranteed you will have a great time however this game lacks extremely at the higher level just look at a clip from a tournament that happened yesterday a pro player has earned money from this game actually tweeted midgame because his opponent resolved to a style where he was just waiting for punishes https clips twitch trust me this is how sixty of all matches turn out tldr its an excellent game for playing casually dont invest time into it if youre going to play ranked
that skill tree is huge but the actual amount of choices is limited some call this game path of life nodes because if you dont pick a ton of life nodes chances are youll be a weak leaf unable to resist the slightest breeze by the time you get to the third difficulty that said the games done a number of forced skill tree resets over the last year and its a pain to have to restart such a huge build every time then again its nice to be given the freedom to do so because like many others i completely messed up my build by not holding to the life node rule glass cannon comes to mind all in all its a great game many times better than diablo three and free to boot and best of all unlike most f2p games the devs of this game have a strict no pay to win ever rule anything you can buy in this game is decorative extra inventory slots cool special effects and pets totally worth it because the game is fair to all players
early access reviewi beta tested this game and in its current state i wouldnt recommend it the grind takes too long and the game has moved away from having fun robots i played when it was only team death match there was no flipping method and only helium ive had fun since those days but the fact that they took away uber points and added so much grind is intollerable i grinded tier ten to have a megabot which dont exist anymore if they dont change the money grubing version of this game i recommend not downloading this game i will update this post if things change freejam im looking at you
couldnt play on pc windows ten whenever i hold acceleration button turning leftright doesnt work have to release acceleration in order to turn is it supposed to work like that
i have almost one thousands hours in this game and i am addicted to it yes but i am still playing in hopes that hirez can seriously get its together new gods are always over powered even after being on the public test servers and some old gods still need to be worked on and are over powered everything is now about gems which you have to pay real money for and this game is getting greedy as with issues of longer que times gods being under or overpowered and a decent bit of toxic players i wouldnt recommend this game unless you buy nothing and play the free rotation gods unless hirez does some serious fixes to their game and not try and produce a ing battle royal spin off oh and i almost forgot their servers are having some malfunctions where people dc from games at the start and have to reconnect which takes a couple minutes which in a moba the first couple minutes of a game is huge and then if people finish a game sometimes you get stuck on an endless victory or defeat screen that you have to restart the game to fix and then on your friends list if you and your friend get out of seperate games at the same time you cant invite them because it says they are still in game so that means that one of you has to restart the game in order to fix this issue thats my two cents peace
best game na first off running max setting sitting in a bush with a sniper rifle but cant see a damn thing then getting cross map snipe by a pistol is nice also good luck starting fresh imagine the fun you will have getting spawn camped like a boss with like two tanks dominating your team cuz most of your team have rifles of some sorts but dont have at stuff gg thanks love not winning games over and over and over cuz i dont anything other then my swinging to fight a tank with
"early access reviewi have played hours days weeks and it was to much fun to stop it was so adictive but sinse updates came some of the updates wer pretty cool but with this update it broke my heart they have ruined everything i do not recommend playing it now its not fun anymore and i dont see a point in playing it anymore first i rate freaking one thousand, one hundred and ten now i rate two hundred and thirty four thousand, two hundred and ten r i p my good old friend robocraft"
ive been playing the game for several years now as a tester the gameplay is up to the standard of any competitive multiplayer you can name its matured to the point the balance changes are made with the aim of keeping things fresh instead of putting out fires there are very few other games that can give you the same feeling that dreadnought provides and none that ive played recently the visual aesthetics are fantastic and with the steam release the game now has audio to match that gravitas i am a fan of the fluidity of the new ui introduced for the steam release as well it needs some refinement but over all it is much slicker and more modern than the previous iteration i reccommend this game to all fans of the vehicle shooter genre it is familiar enough that anyone who has played mech warrior online star conflict fractured space crossout roblox etc will be able to get into the hotseat right away and at the same time it is a different beast altogether i guarantee youll enjoy the feeling of unstoppable power that comes with piloting a ship the size of a city blocksome resizing to follow pc ui conventions higher res module icons better menu mapping to reduce number of clicks needed and get rid of that ugly edit ship button
early access reviewthe game has some problems but as the saying goes u cant judge a book by its cover u should give it a try and then decide wht u think me and my friend bought the game and we a curently injoying it i my my self bought three copys and i dont regret it i hope they keep updateing and inproving the game i cant wait to see wht becomes of it
the learning curve can be tough at times but i find myself in a strange addiction of always coming back to playing this game even if its only so i can get just a little bit better at it
hello possible future trovian do you remember playing any sandbox games in the past when i thought of sandbox games done right i always felt like terraria was the game i enjoyed the most and spent hours upon hours designing my home in my world or just my world in general so to me the nostalgia and excitement around the game always struck me now picture this terraria in a voxel3d based universe granted trove is rather new the blogs and updates from the creators make the game even more promising i look forward to be able to do world bosses or the such in the future this game allows you the freedom to switch your combat classesloadout as well as the exploration of the world in this game there are guild like groups called clubs some of these clubs will really blow your mind with music playing on actual tracks ive been really enjoying this game so far and although the marketeconomy is really ambigous its mostly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone considering it
if you love yugioh and wanted to duel with your friends youre going to hate this game its a stupid cash grab filled with way too many popups doesnt even follow the game rules nor do cards do what theyre suppose to this is an insult to a great game and i wouldnt even play it for free thats how bad this game was it took at least ten years to get through the intro course even after asking your level of familiarity with the game the deck creation is extremely limited and the navigation of the games menus is also broken and dumb not to mention the game barly fits your resolution and is in the dumbest aspect ratio this game is trash trash yugi would be spinning his grave
this review will be edited over the course of elsword updatesthis game is so awesome pros ten different characters to choose from with three different job paths for each one giving them a variety of different skills and playstyles the leveling up for starters is uper fast and once you get past level three thousand and forty the leveling gets more challenging theres an elsword website which keeps you updated on every single tiny thing added or announced so thats awesome a pvp player vs player mode which pairs you up with a random player to battle a dungeon mode you can play with friends or randomly matched people to complete ingame story quests the characters voices were originally in korean but now kog is slowly revamping each character with some fresh new english voice lines and they sound awesomecons the pvp system is kind of unfair you always get paired up with some elsword veteran who ends up demolishing you with an endless combo but i dont really see any way to fix that this game is kind of p2w having you spend money on the ingame currency kching to get the good costumes and stuffaside from that the game is great i totally recommend this 910banthus approved
"i love the scale of this game the maps are bigger than anything i have ever seen before in a game sometimes in open areas youll get pinned down behind a rock while fifty tanks battle it out around you my only complaint is it takes forever to get cert points this game kinda has a pay to win aspect over all though this game pretty epic eight thousand, five hundred and ten"
a wonderfully crafted cartoony arena shooter there are nine classes to choose from one the scout a bostonborn rude inyourface and speedy character that has a double jump ability2 the soldier a crazed patriot from americas heartland hes versatile and a great starter class to get familiar with tf23 the pyro a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related4 the demoman a scrumpyswilling explosives expert from the scottish highlands5 the heavy hailing from the ussr he is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in tf26 the engineer specializes in constructing and maintaining buildings that provide support7 the medic provides healing for the members of his team and has a special ability known as an ubercharge8 the sniper from the aussie outback this character provides longrange support with his trusted sniper rifle9 the spy this character can be rendered invisible and can disguise as members of the other team there are also a plethora of maps and weapons that can also be used to your advantage to gain control and defeat the other team tf2 is definitely one of the best freetoplay games to ever be
i was playing as my archer twenty eight and i joined a cemetary dungeon with a knight with full t12 tops and an exa hp ring he had one star and my archer took less damage from the skellys than he did he was level fourteen and died on the third boss rip thirty

early access reviewthis game is filled with nothing but lobbies of cheaters most people in game just complain about being put in a loby with a cheater rather then vote to kick them and when a vote is started everyone votes not to kick the cheater even though theyre single handedly making the game worse for everyone even worse from my perspective it looks like the devs dont even bother to bar them from playing they just give them a sub name cheater do yourself a favor and stay far from this game prosevery map seems to be a retexture of old counterstrike maps pretty cool even if its badlarge and easily accesible gun library to mess withsimple and easy controlsconscheaters in every lobbyyou get shot in the head a lot through the mapangles control too muchoverprices crap weaponsunderpriced overpowered weaponsno one votes to kick the cheateryour team will never winshader bugs in everymap make the fight onesidedlike above con each map is sided towards the warriors to win high ground and right turns with long tunnels to put a gunner downas you can tell i did not spend much time on this game due to the downsides provided above
this game is tedious and frustrateing but addicting in a bad way do not get this game it will suck one hundred of your like away faster than wow and is far less entertaining and i hate wow
astonishingly bad graphics and repetitive unchallenging game play the pop ups and reward systems suggests it as being grind and shop centric the mechanics of play looked like dnd 4e as a computer game i much prefered neverwinter nights two and id rather return to that very dated game than endure any more of this
game would be pretty cool if not the matchmaking system the matchmaking is a joke you get like five six or sometimes even ten defeats in a row with score like one seven zero seven very often situations like six people from the team are tier seven and you are tier six very bad matchmaking is what wg games are known from pretty well so no suprises here unless you use premium account the matchmaking seems to be better when you use premium account so maybe the mm system is made on purpose in such a way to get you frustrated and start to think i need premium account in order to grind effectively
early access reviewworst game ive played in recent years no balance only two weapons mean anything in the game and the most common tactic is just to camp absolute waste of disk space players arent toxic for the most part at least
early access reviewnot bad so far very clunky and slow there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships and the loadout upgrades feel underwhelmingnot compeling the servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well even on a machine that far surpases the tech specs for the game still strangely fun though think moba in space but not like you would a normal moba much of the skill elements involved in moba games are removed especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large slow clunky space ships the only near exception to this would be the blink ability flash from lol available to some ships recommended might as well try it and maybe it will get better
running for your life simulator two thousand and fifteen crank up the volume its no fun if you dont get a good scare or three and just when you think youve made it past jumps to much more deadly scares nightmares crawling up your rear while the room is a red haze theyre backthose damn maze rooms thats always where my friend and i get butchered and the damn controls at least you heal a little every second so you stand a fighting chance from floor to floor made it thirteen of the way through room three hundred and ten before eating it the last time pick it up for a free game that looks straight out of nineteen ninetytwos its surprisingly creepy
not really worth playing installed created character and thirty seconds into gameplay shot dead chreat the second survivor and get booted from the server first survivor now revivable and play long enough to type two messages into global when some one says every one is hostile and shot dead not worth playing a game with such a toxic gameplay on beginner servers no need to worry about zombies only nee to worry about players killing you when you have only been playing for the first thirty seconds repeatedly never got a chance to get weapons nor a chance to learn how to play the game will be uninstalling the game and not returning i will stick to actual zombie games
biggest rippoff i ever encountered spend approximately fifty euros played twenty drafts rarely had a decent game either mana flooded constantly or not being able to play second colour while my soo called human opponents play thirty four colours constantly and have surprisingly always the exact answer in hand that they need to turn the game around if i do manage to get on board yeah rite
this game used to be good then i checked it out and now its a massive grindfest and you gain basically nothing from a match like cmon some things cost like 100k and you gain two 3k per game sooooplease fixbut the robot building is niece310
this is such a fun little game they need to create more characters put a chat in and add some interactive game features to the middle of the board i feel like the dice are rigged too but overall this game is really fun
early access reviewthe people that claim that this game will give you a virus or steal your data are either fortnitepubg fanboys or people that installed hacks like ing morons the game is absolutely incredible from my experience so far if someone has actual proof of a virus or stolen data please comment thanks
3its a good game a better more hd version of minecraft also the devs slowly do it but they listen to what the players want and are less rude than other games devs im happy with the team and the game
early access reviewi expected this game to get better over the years but all the devs are doing is trying to make it more profitable with microtransactions now i just feel that i wasted all that time by expecting it to get better this game is now far past its prime and it will keep going downhill the developers are trying to force people to spend money when all they need to do is make a good game
game the concept is good but the devs reduce players capabilities so if they dont like you your bullets dont have as much effect and im not making this up the owner of gaijin said so stupid game would not reccomend
the best arpg ive played endless hours of entertainment sixty less than competing brands they continue to update the game free of charge i would say poe is about a twenty game for end game you will want to buy some stash tabs for quality of life improvements other than that the only thing you can buy is cosmetics which is entirely up to you if you want to earn free cosmetics take part in the races or challenge leagues where you complete challenges for free cosmetics if you want diablo four play this
am i playing a twenty tens mmo jesus christ usually i dont complain about graphics but having experience consecutive stutters fps drops for this quality of graphics this game is hurting my damn eyes well then again its free soooo
glad to have wasted 1k hours on this game endlessly grinding for no reason the objective of this game is to go from dungeon to dungeon killing enemies to gain xp and loot such as items weapons or gem boxes doing this results in boredom and makes me want to die there are several classes to choose from some being op such as high dmg shots or firing five hundred arrows a second and some being useless and never used its unbalanced but the developers dont seem to care about their game but rather how much money they can make within their updates the updates usually happen around special events such as christmas or easter ect and even if they do proper updates fixing stuff and remaking something they include a headsstart pack that includes things that are either hardimpossible to get while grinding for them overall the game is a piece of dont spend money on it
all these guys saying it is p2wits noti have nine spcspecial characters and over fifty green magic balls and i invested nothing in this gameits all about skilland you can just mute everyone who is toxic at higher levels youll find better people
spent more than three hundred hours when i got it from the bethesda store just dont buy anything in game because the purchases apply per save file its better without buying anything trust me it is a very admirable game i really like the conversations that happen between the dwellers and when you go for quests and raids sometimes they are whacky sometimes they are cringy sometimes they are just downright smooth i highly recommend this game one thousand and ten
early access reviewoverall a great game after several playing need to fix a little bit about accuracy and speed on shooting maybe after release we can get new skins new mount or new chicken overall its a great game
looks great in vr on the vive until you start to look around at populated areas an it turns into a juddery sickening mess and this is on a 46ghz 6700k with a gtx one thousand and eighty with the default low vr graphics settings unplayable on the vive
great game except when you get kicked and get a stupid message about game session active so u keep trying then your ip gets blocked for an hour and you cant even submit a ticket guess i lose my backpack and my sht ontop of getting kicked for an hour bs bs bs
honestly going into this i didnt think i would find this game to be as enjoyable as i did its just a really casual unmoddable version of early minecraft but with more emphasis on materials and with more of a vaguely scifi slant rather than minecrafts vaguely fantasy one theres a few quirks in the engine relating to being built in unity rather than java for instance unitys physics are a bit spotty and sometimes underground mobs will hilariously fly through the earth into the stratosphere as if called to rapture however from my end the game seems to run much smoother than minecraft does and its much easier to set up a multiplayer server the biggest negative i have for it is that it really spends a lot of time advertising dlc to the point it really starts to get annoying but hey at its heart its essentially another minecraft and who doesnt like minecraft
early access reviewwhat can i say about this if youre a magic the gathering fan its pretty decent and the only real thing that i has in common with hearthstone is the style as with all card games luck can and will skrew you over as well as bless you and make you feel epic to complain about rng in a card game is just silly i have not had much troubel at all with making decent decks on this game with gauntlet mode and forge making it easy to get a decent collection as well as the ability to frag all the extras and create what you want granted some cards are way over priced but think of it this way some people payed one hundred for a zapdos or one thousand for a black lotus in magic terms all in all decent card game with a mana system similar to magic but slower paced than hearthstone and its free to play so you can get a feel for the game before you decide to commit so give it a try
wow this game is complete dog completely luck based if you are someone with no skills in life a fifteen gpa retardation are fifty six and wiegh eightyfive pounds like robbie then you should play this game if you have a future in life dont play this game if you are over the hieght of fifty six dont play this game if you like in the play this game if you smell like cheeks play this game if nobody like you and you have no friends play this game if any of this applies to you follow these instruction trust me this game is really bad
very detailed sim and a joy to fly using a flightstick a big drawback is the inability to skip the guy talking or to restart the tutorial so every time you fail you have to sit through ten minutes of talking again
never understood the buzz of these games everything is behind a wall of time or money and there is no gameplay i can appreciate the art and lore but other then that its a cell phone game dont even get me started on that subject
a great game to play in the background while youre doing an assignment or playing another game or waiting for premeire pro to renderits a good time waster just dont expect much to happen
early access reviewwould one hundred recommend this game i havent been able to find any faults with it so far and ive played for a pretty good amount of time compared to pubg fornite and other br games it definitely feels nicer to play as in it feels consistent and controls movement and overall game functionality is just nice to use i dont think i can fault the game as of yet nor do i think ill be able too at this rate for an early access its honestly one of the best games ive ever played id even tgo to the length of saying its the best ive played this year good job
this is a game i have no doubt in my mind that this is a game this game exists i can not say that this game does not exist because well ofcourse it does i mean come on its a video game and it was made a video game was made at some point and they decided this would be that game now who is they well ofcourse its the people who made this game but why did they make this game i mean why because a game was at one point bound to be made thats right thus this game was made this game has it all a name gameplay music and i heard and saw all of that while playing this game now my opinion on those things is that they were put in the game and thus they are a part of a game and thus they are the game and thus they are indeed a game would i reccomend this game i mean a game is a game after all and thus i must say that this game is a game which is why this game is most definetly a game for me thank you for this game
overall rr is a great system it works has no bugs its smooth when you are playing performs great the way you buy content is nice if you are a online racer like iracing but much cheaper but with all that content especially the gt3 cars they really should add 24h cycle and weather would make a huge difference in this game and if you do that well peopl with vr would love it thats pretty much the reason i dont continue with this sim and if anyone reading this wanna buy content go to their site and buy vrp its cheaper that way as you wont pay the steam fees i guess so overall if you are a beginner to the simracing world i recommend buying it if you dont want to depend on mods and dont mind the static environment buy it too
this game is litteraly p2p if you dont pay you wont enjoy ten first minutes are okay then its garbage i wanted to check the lügher out well too bad gotta pay for it okay then i uninstall its a one hundred and ten for me ce jeux cest un pay to play si tu payes pas tu apprécies pas les ten premières minutes sont juste ok puis cest de la mert je voulais regarder le lügher pistolet allemand ben nan faut payer pas de problème je désinstalle cest un one hundred and ten pour moi
early access reviewyoull see a lot of opinions of this game the fanboys who will support whatever the developers do and explain to you that that freejam is doing everyone a service by allowing this game to be free you have the new players who probably think this could be a great game if they worked on a few things things that have existed in the past and have since been done away with you then have the old players the ones who put a lot of effort to get that last bit of rp to get the next piece of hardware to hopefully lift you to the next tier those players have seen this game turn into a phone app that says free next to it and then right underneath in game purchases optional but we all know that you need to purchase those if you dont want to be miserable for a while im one of those players and this is my first steam review of a game because i think whats happened to this game is unfortunate its a shame that all the feedback all the bug reports we have compiled have led to this latest update
product received for freeearly access reviewits just completely pay to win so get to the main game aka tank vs jet sorry propeller aircraft vs infantry comabt you have to be level five now the problem is its so hard to get to level up and ironically there is a membership program to level faster its a good game but its so pay to win
early access reviewthis game is very fun and exciting the first time i played i love sandbox survival games but i think it would be better if it had way more customizations for your character and house decor also more mobs it got boring really quick
early access reviewin my opinion the gunplay is horribile in this game doesnt feel smooth at all what other have said already about this games client running in the background is true after running this game and playing my pc would freeze get blue screen etc this was caused by the gaijin client that kept running in the background even after the game was closed even after opening up task manager and killing it unistalled the game and freezes and blue screens were gone
i have read in a couple places and they keep talking about adding motion control support for vive when exactly will this happnen i know people think that it would not work but have you playde time machine the motion controllers work fine with it the left controller is your flight stick im sure it can be programed easily for dcs the right stick can be many things has anyone tried universe sandbox with a key press on left stick where the grip is you can open up a display on top of the left stick without giving up control of the flight and select menus or selections using your right controller the right controller can also be used to virtually touch the switches and turn knobs all by holding down the trigger and using the motion of turning or pushing it can also be your throttle hold down trigger move forward for thrust or backwards for cutting engines if i could code i would be all over this in a heart beat thanks for listening and please let me know if this is possible
early access reviewwelp if isnt this game another one of gaijins money carving shovels winning in this game absolutely gets you nothing and really doesnt matter if you end up one or ten at the end of the day both of those poor bastards get zilch this game isnt anything to be taken seriously just play it in your free time and only and only for fun cosmics grinding in this game is just pure payupand btw if they tried to charge you for the simple free gameplay later on just pls stop playing and delete this let gaijin gets drowned in its own ocean of greed dont let them sink youoh and btw hackers are bombing the out of this game do something about it you useless pieces of and remove that in pan for lord stalin satans sake and jessssssssus ing christ dont let even begin about the ing hitboxes in this game
two is one of the deepest most satisfying and equally frustrating gaming experiences in this era i still love the game and its such an excitement to watch as an esport however it really should come with a warning playing or rather learning to play dota is a part time job the time investment in this game is huge you will get cussed out have terrible backtoback matches and a new patch will come along and make your favourite heroes a pain to play that said if you have the time youd be hard pressed to find a more satisfying feeling than getting that perfect initiation or landing a 5man ultimate and the comebacks it is possible to comeback when your team is getting their handed to them so dont give up tldr must play if you have the time and patience
if you like building games at all creativerse is definitly worth a try it is a bit slow going at first but you dont have to memorize any crafting recipees theyre unlocked as you craft things and remembered for you you can even favorite and track recipees which helps if youre wanting to make a lot of a few things theres no reason not to give it a shot since its free to play
a decent half court basketball game that actually has nice graphics skills and cosmetics the only problem is that there are pay to win elements within the game that gives some people an edge on the bright side this game was alot more popular than freestyle football so it probably wont close down soon
early access reviewive been playing cs for almost twenty years its my number one game in those twenty years i always looked for other fun games to play in between cs games i played hl deathmatch day of defeat all cods until mw2 moh unreal tournemant quake i enjoyed all of them more recently i tried and played several other games looking for something new destiny two hated it fortnite absolutely terrible the latest cod ww2 enjoyed the single player but multiplayer wasnt my thing i got all hyped for battalion nineteen fortyfours but until now it dissapointed me i will give it another chance though as they are still working on the game the one game i tried and kept playing was pubg although the game was not optimized well had all of its flaws it was fun to play for a few rounds what i dont understand is that people can play it for hours on end it gets so ing boring the recent update with the smaller map and more loot was a change i liked but overall for me the game is broken i ing hate the game it got great potential but the developers are just milking the cow now in my opinion hence i deleted the game and searched for something new enter cuisine royale free early access i ing love this game so early in development it looks better feels better and is optimized better then pubg spray patterns and hitboxes are already really good but can still be improved i like the random spawn points loot is balanced pretty good sometimes you can be unlucky with loot but if you play it right you will always find something to get a kill and steal there loot i personally like the funny gadgets and perks but even without them the game would be a lot of fun it could be interesting in the future the have several game modes one like it is now and one that is more realistic a mode without the bunny slippers actual backpacks instead of shopping bags realistic armor and helmets would probably attract a lot more players to the game what should be improved at this time is to have the lobby actually in the game cause right now you need to enter a game to be able to change your settings key binds are also not working for me i cant seem to change them also missing an option to bind every weapon on one key primary secondary all i see is previous weapon which i dont like in game the developers should just keep doing what there doing i think there doing a great jobthey keep bringing updates that fixes bugs and bring improvements to the gameas the game is free there is no reason not to try itwould i pay for this game absolutely yes
early access reviewgreat game great graphics fun pvp no op crap that i can see one on one is normally anybodies game instead of one ship just pulverising only downfall of this game is the ing matchmaking is broken half the time as in y ou cant connect to a match to save your life other then that great stuff excited to see where it goes hopefully not pay to win
really fun game with a minecraft sorta feel to in way better and more independant compared to minecraft ripoffs great for all ages if your into a creativebuilding games pros large selection of building resourcesfree free freeworlds seem to be completely randommultiplayer support with the ability to have passwords for privacycons requires account out of steampay to access blueprints and other features usefullcan be repetitve and stuckwhat i mean by stuck is once you have completed all the recipes for items and have maxed there isnt anywere to go besides buildnow that i think about it that pretty much every game
"i dont know how im supposed to start this review back in the days robocraft was my goto game and one of my favourite games robocraft has been such a great game i really loved playing i dont exactly know why the developers decided to change up the whole game principle with tiers one two and so on in my last days back then the boss battle i guess was introduced and i enjoyed playing it as well and then the developers crashed the game with introducing levels instead of tiers and changing the game mode from just stacking the whole team onto the other side and capturing the enemys base to this weird thing with these protonium reactor from wikipedia lol when i started the game today after a long time i was greeted with my old account and twentyfive cases i had to open 5mins uff the game went a long way from free2play to pay4win with cases and addons for ten thousand, eight hundred and ninety six i searched for a match and had to wait for about a minute because i left the last match a year or two ago h2 yeah so what am i supposed to say in conclusion h2back in the days i absolutely loved the game but in the current state i dont like it and i wouldnt invest my time into this game anymore50h outside steam"
i really did enjoy this game for a long time and its a really good idea of a game but the game is becomeing somewhat of a pay to win when you remove the ability to get a new class in a game thats enjoyabe because of its variaty of classes and only make them obtainable through in game purchases ruins the experience of the game
early access reviewcompared to other battle royals like fortnite or pubg realm royale is one hundred my favorite theyre is so many different mechanics in the game that makes it different the forge system armor mounts chickenrevives classes and etc
smite is really a mixed bag for me i stopped playing league a couple of years ago for a lot of the same reasons that other people did the fun in the game had long been sucked dry by people who throw hissy fits if they dont get the most kills or if theyre paired with people who are still trying to learn the game i was never that great at the game and found that i really wasnt able to improve when no one wanted to play with a noob and with that i left when i heard about smite in early twenty fifteens from jontron i was eager to give mobas a second chance i loved playing the game and found myself a welcome member of the community as much as i loved the game i stopped playing for awhile only picking up the game back up on steam in the summer of 2017after getting used to the game again i started playing pvp again holy how things had changed it really felt like i was playing league again with all of the ing at least once a day out of all the games i play ill see newer players bullied out of games in my opinion its a communitys responsibility to encourage its members to improve instead of just calling them noobs and all over them smite is an amazing game but i think anyone who isnt contributing to the toxicity can agree that the community has isolated itself from new players and finding the enjoyment that the game once offered is becoming increasingly difficultalso holy someone fix susano please
early access reviewi bought this game within a week or so after it came out on steam bought the harbinger pack when it did come out and recently upgraded to the vanguard pack because of how well it plays now as it stands right now i wish there was a maybe on the recommened button section i cannot vote for nor vote against the game it is not quite pollished enough for my liking but its still a great game which makes me torn over whether or not to recommend to friends pros good graphics at max settings 1080p getting six thousand and ninety fps with my current setupok balance between classesneeds a bit more tweekinggood overall selection of ships and skinslove the exp and credits mechanics which were nonexistent when i quit before cons missing skins what happened to the ghost gtype skin its missing from my invintory and know i had it before i lost interest in the game edit seems i was mistaken i did not realize that there were two versions of the ghost one being the premium ship i got from vangard and the one that you have to gain exp to get which i believe would have the skin i thought was missingall i seem to ever get are eu servers thought by now they would have implemented us servers or ones that are closerto the us for the sake of lag reduction for us based players honestly this is one of the reasons i quit the last time no way this is on my end seeing as i have a custom gaming rig and over sixty meg line plus i have seen alot of complaints from other people about this in chat since i started to play again really fix this soon or you may loose more people againprice point price is perfect if and only if the server issue gets fixed either faster server net speed or add us serversfrom what i can tell no way to make a platoon of more than two in a group i could be wrong since i havent invited anyone to the gamepractice test area vs dumb ai to test a ship would be nice which i would have thought would have been placed in this game and the way the key layout is would be nice to have this to test a rebind of keys on a shiprandom matchmaking throws me off a bit i remember ability to create servers and and remeber the servers identifying as eu or us based off the hostnot really a con dev killed me enough said lol honestly this is a cool thing devs actually playing the game that they design which to me surpised me and made me smile one thousand and ten would die against a dev again
early access reviewfor some reason i find minecraft boring despite my kids loving it somehow this game has spoken to me and its turned out to be great family fun at our house we purchased two copies for the kids and one for myself and the wife it may not be the most amazing game ever but its a lot of fun being able to build things and explore in a simple but yet complex dynamic environment the graphics are good in the sense that its a step up from minecraft though performance seems to be a bit laggy at times for unknown reasons not bad enough to completely impact gameplay overall if youre tired of the same old minecraft give creativerse a try
first the community here suck dont search for teammates second same thing because of hackers third full of bugg in server lobby and when you are finally connected you could lose hours of gameplay just because ther server isnt implemented and kick you because of timeout delay the devs did they developped a game at least are just here to steal money from some fanatics members finding worth to be at the top scoreboard and dont give a damn s for other players in a nutshell give you the opportunity to waste your time on better lands than those ones indeed
early access reviewit was an okay game but this update is garbage the update took away all that made this game slightly intresting in a battle royal andâ â â â â â on it uninstalling if i wanted a fortnight ripoff i would just go play it
early access reviewfor someone who dislikes the toxicity of multiplayer games eternal is to some degree a breath of fresh air the singleplayer content is awesome i love digital card games that embrace the singleplayer experience the game itself has the complexity of mtg but the accessibility of hearthstone i dont get why this game isnt more well recieved
early access reviewthis game was a promiseing game and a good time up untill the the last two patchs have just killed it dont bother down loading there are better alternitives out there good luck have fun
early access reviewbest game in the world what can i say fornite is garbage town pubg is two fps town this mixsgood graphics with cars epic guns and ing pans this has to bethe best god damn game i have ever played like no joke i got eighty hours on this beast and now they got cooking seasons what is next runs great plays great feels great keep up all the amazing working
early access reviewthe game is very fun at first but gets boring very quickly you basically have to beat the campaign to actually get started with new cards the campaign is fast and kind of easy and after you beat it theres nothing specific to really do the quests are alright but not that interesting for the most part
keeps on giving me an error while downloading the files in game two hours trying to download the game files read the real reviews about the game not the funny reviews dont waste your time or money on this game
great game great graphics and good for novice to experts if you want to use the htc vive you may want to disconect your vive from the pc before launching this game for the first time to allow you to go into the vr settings and select mouse as an option otherwise you may not have a way of navigating the menus and get stuck at the main menu once i eventually figured out i had to do that i was then able to set up my hotas and get flying caution may cause motion sickness around barrol roll number four enjoy
tf2 used to be my favourite game i clocked thousands of hours on it i bought hats crafted and fragged with the matchmaking update it often takes five hundred and thirty minutes to play a map of your choice despite an ample amount of compatible players searching for it i wrote this entire review while waiting for a game to start with thirtyfour compatible players in my country which according to the map selection screen was green meaning many players were available to play with matches you against teams with less players than yours making it no challenge at all or impossible if youre on the other side of that equation this is because they removed autobalance which wasnt the best system but at least worked well enough makes it very difficult to play with andor invite friends to your game in order to invite and play with a friend neither of you can actively be in a game invites dont pop up like messages do so you can easily miss such an invite because it wont show up in a game if youre in a game and invited to another game tough luck for you no more hopping into your friends game partway through even if there are four more players on red than blue it also makes it impossible to play against a friend on opposite teams no more grudge matches with your peers the update destroyed the world of community servers that made tf2 so casual and fun were six months into this update and subsequent updates and its still broken they could have left tf2 as it was for years it was an awesome game for years and years new games with better graphics and features came out but tf2 survived with a healthy community of players valve ignored a huge user outcry against the update and unfortunately tf2 will be one of those games we used to play and used to be so much fun we could have just gotten some more useless crates hats or weapons but instead they broke it they could have left it exactly as it was and people would have kept buying two crate keys spending thousands of dollars on hats and donating to community servers but instead they tried to make it better to compete with overwatch its awful now i only login occasionally at the insistence of my steam friends what a shamerip tf2 two thousand and sixteen
by far my favourite ccg and ive played a lot of them yes the transition to the new client was rough but sparkypants have quickly sorted almost all of the bugs and it feels a lot faster than the old client now looking forward to new features and the new expansion
early access reviewrealm royale is by far my favorite game of two thousand and eighteen its quite literally the only game i truly enjoy playing for hours after all the horrendoues game and community destroying patches realm went through because of hirezs foolish ideas im glad to say realm is back at its peak in fact i think it is even better then it was back in its prime when it was released in june two thousand and eighteen this game is loads of fun takes skill and strategy and is awesome to play with friends i highly recommend this game to anyone especially if you are a fan of the battle royale genre one thousand and ten love this game so much
early access reviewdo not play unless you wish to be disapointed id say come back in two to three years then maybe you can play it normally right now in its forever beta stage do not play do not bother spending money overall waste of time as of now that is
what a load of rubbish lost all my stuff after being disconnected from a server actually one of the worst games i have played dont waste your time many more zombie games out there better then this load of bull
started playing twenty thirteens and its still entertaining me best support with a reply within 1h free expansions every three months and a big community on twitch and reddit even tho the plebs on reddit are real
early access reviewi loved the game before twenty fifteens when it was only here for you to enjoy but now it has the money grabing system and id write a whole story about how bad this game is now but i have to go poop bye
early access reviewonly good thing is that the game is free but will try to take your money anyway this game has changed since i have first played it and i will probably never play it again
this game is super funnot the same devs as the original infestationeven says this in the description learn to readadvertised as a pvp mmo that is why there are guns everywherethe respawn timer is there for a reasonnot paytowin because of private servers you just need to not suck it is super easy to loot on fifty pop serversthe cooldown for medkits is not four seconds it is for other meds but not medkits dont be dumbthe beginner servers are there for a reasonthe third person view is not an advantage when everyone has iti can log into servers within ten seconds just get a better computeryes this games crashes but it is part of the charm this game is super fun if you have some friends to play with while it makes you super mad sometimes you will always come back it just takes alot of skill to actually play this game if you are dumb at all you will suck and die alot then you will go make a review on how this game sucks because you kept dying i played the original infestation when it was still called warz and i loved it then too it has always been fun and all the little not game breaking bugs just add much to the enjoyment of this game and honestly the graphics may not be the best but if you play colorado v1 and wait until night time you will see how beautiful this game can get
great game to play with friends and work together with real world strategies to outsmart your opponents whther you like to blast away in arcade mode or go full immersion in simulator mode war thunder does its best to suite all players
great strategy game for fallout fans i have been hearing a lot of negative reviews for this game but i think its great plus i dont have a smart phone so this compensates the game for me eight hundred and ten
like many of the remaining players who stay true to this game despite developers shoutout to artemisknives sergeytitovprops to russiancaliber for carrying the team on your back constant cheaters ddos attacks duping glitching bugs terrible swimming animations and people yelling brazil brazil in chat while throwing down zombie barricade riot shields down one after another etc the list can literally go on for the entirety of this review we continue to play this toxicity infested community crash prone survival video game i think the best way to sum up this game is that it was built on an engine that just feels right for the pvp intense atmosphere that we know as crashz i mean warz i mean infestation survivor stories or whatever emulator we happen to be playing at the time one thing that should be known is that one of the lead developers if not the main lead developer wrote cheats notice how i didnt say hacks cheats are a method of cheating or exploiting game using scripts or taking advantage of information received but not displayed to the client from what i understand he continues to write cheats in order to ruin other emulators and bring a larger player base to his version i think this is sort of scummy to do but i also think its smart i respect intellect and you definitely earned my respect ive been playing this emulator since it got an official steam release ive racked up two hundred and fifty hours so far and i can gladly say i enjoy this game but i will say if youve never played a version of this engine you will most likely hate every moment of it unless you have friends who can teach you the ropes youre in for a rough time for a free video game ive spent about twenty dollars on microtransactions so i could have a different player model and a few skins that i thought looked nice did it give me an advantage over any other players no if youre truly looking for a free pvp game where the essential idea is to take gear from other players gi and put it in yours as long as the current developers continue to improve the game reduce cheaters and the player base remains i will continue to play newz
good f2p mmo with a more active combat system then most very fun there are definitely some p2w aspects but if you learn where to find gear you can sell you can make a fair bit of money quickly and you can freely trade ingame currency for peoples zen built right in so with some effort you can get what you want it seems rough at first but you just need to figure out whats worthwhile to sell
i started playing this game on the first week of public open beta and have loved it ever since its like world of tanks in space if you like games like world of tanks or world of warships youll probably love this game
i never played the mobile version of the game but since i saw that this game came to steam and it was free i decided to try it out its really cool and fun and all for yugioh fans but now i want bleach brave souls and dokkan battle on steam now xdp s this is also a good substitute for
its a very short game and definitely worth the time some of the bosses are really tedious and youre suddenly running and just trying to get to the next checkpoint before you die the jump scares were really fun because i played this with someone that jumped basically every time if youre not the type to fall for those then there will only be a really fewinsanely creepy moments would play again probably gonna get the dlc during the summer sale
i very recently had to redownload this game due to my computer getting infected and forgot my previous username as a result i was not able to recover that account so i made a new one i am very happy with some of the changes such as the taxi being instant and available anywhere and im looking forward to redoing both the deathsong and groncicle challenges having previously finished them however i am very dissapointed that i keep having to shut my computer off in order to continue to play as it frequently gets stuck when im trying to complete my missions i love this game and i love the idea of it but this frequent freezing is extremely annoying i hope a patch is found soon
important notice to dota two 1waiting time for players loading screen is too shortdisadvantage to all low performance slow pc and connectioncyber cafe in most of asia having all this problempls reconsider to add more waiting time2courier hotkey inside setting is missing
early access reviewonce upon a time there was a small little gamecalled robocraft but now its known as pay2progess craft do i support this game not anymore ps even when you pay you wont progress
early access reviewrecent changes sure makes you question the future of f2p but overall this is still the best digital card game out there its fun and i feel like i can trust the developers and where they are taking the game
wouldnt recommend anyone play this its basically just a laggy glitchy popanimation version of maplestory also level five in like thirty seconds what i mean i dont really like grindy games all that much but come on it shouldnt go that fast only real benefit it has is the tutorial takes about the same amount of time as the aforementioned leveling
this game is stupid dont have thurstmaster wheel setup i have a thrustmaster ferrari four hundred and fiftyeight italia and doesnt work so this just sucks dont waiste time downloading sixteen gb of this crap
early access reviewthis is probably one of the worst mmo experiences ive had ever and ive been there for pretty much everything eso swtor vanilla wow ffxiv gw2 bdo tera etc etc the bad i highly recommend staying away from this unfinished unpolished piece of dung the performance is abysmal i was getting 8fps in town open world as long as no one was around i had a constant sixty got into a small camp with a few people it dropped to 30ish for a three year old game running ue3 cmon its twenty eighteens we expect better text in general was not properly translated in fact it was confusing i wasnt sure what my skills did doing the tutorial was very confusing because of it it was telling me to add stuff to my bars that didnt exist they had different names than what the actual quest text said the good the combat was actually entertaining it wasnt a big deal like nothing revolutionary but it was enjoyable questing was pretty standard a pretty ok ish mmo when it was working at least the voice acting was actually ok and well done which is amazing for an asian mmo honestly and the story though i didnt really get very far seemed interesting conclusion the launch experience i wont really complain about i really wouldnt mind sitting in queue if i knew the game was worth it but its not it really isnt its not a playable acceptable product and honestly early access doesnt justify all the issues stay away specs i5 6600k oced to 43ghzmsi 1070x 8gb16gb ram
im not a big fan of mobas but this game is amazing the graphics arent bad it runs smoothly it has many gods the game is strategic very fun i have been adiccted to this game i can not stop playing it it has various game modes one of my favriotes which were conquest its challenging and overall its the best moba ever one thing i dont like i bought some gems on this game only when it was on sale and if u are getting this game do not buy gems till theyre on sale theyre are way to overpriced
early access reviewthis is a much better game imo than hearthstone esl or many other digital card games out there it is simpler than mtg but keeps many of the same rules that are abandoned by more recent card games such as playing mana and instants unfortunately it has already fallen into the problems that led me to quit hearthstone long ago the fact that there are very rare patches and balance changes in the past thirty four months there have only been a handful of new cards and only a couple small balance changes in the current age of sharing decks online this philosophy leads to extremely stale matches against many similar decks i think this could be a great game if the developers took a more liberal approach to making changes in the game but at this point even if they did the playerbase has dwindled significantly since it released in early access
one of the worst communities in the world theres nothing wrong with the game itself but it is a multiplayer game and its a failed experiment getting into ranked games is literally cancer someone doesnt lock in game will start and someone will disconnect everyone will false report literally anyone its literally just a tumor on this earth and i cant stop playing save your soul and pass this up

early access reviewwas a fun game some time ago now its paytowin they also changed gameplay a lot and removed many cool features wouldnt play now even without all those paywalls
a maelstrom of anger fear disillusionment and sheer ecstasy dota two is all these things and more you ll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match in that short span of time grudges will be born heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a g r r martin epic and yet for all its emotional drama both highs and lows you ll still yearn for more just learning to play is an adventure into masochism everyone begins as a dreaded n00b unable to contribute anything but gold and xp to the opposing team a few weeks later and they ll have learned a few tricks where to place wards how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting give it a few months and they ll be rolling with the regulars double stacking recrowing and ggwp will become part of their vernacular immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin theyll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the worlds burgeoning esports scene consider the football metaphor pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots strips and footballs rooney messi and neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people if all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself what s the point of playing if you don t feel something in the end dota two delivers passion and fury in spades and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego just don t look at the item store your partnerparentscommon sense will never understand why you spent thirty five on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero
do not let the free to play aspect fool you what you dont pay with your money you pay with your health used to be a great game now its a profascist propaganda tool toxic community mostly us servers untolerable disbalance in favor of fascist factions in tank battles so youre stuck grinding for silver even tho grinding is already bad in the game excessive grinding in rank five and up even with premium paid overpriced content biased ingame admins who block users for no other reason than to just responding into chat unless they are profascistus in which case even cursing is allowed and goes unpunished ive seen it happen a lot content milking ie you activate a booster only to be mismatched against much higher opponents just so you can waste your boosters without profit even if you pay real money for it once realistic balanced environment now makes legendary tanks look like cardboard boxes with turrets limited coop which is at times severely restricted to paid content and forces players to play arcade game mode to even participate while supressing realistic gaming in the game sb with limited cycled events installs an agent client that starts as a service while it is only understandable that gaijin may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and uplay this agent is at times aggressive and cannot be stopped it also conflicts with security tools much more wrong with this game i wont even bother just stay away from it the only thing that is somewhat fun is simulator flight battles and that in particular if you play with friends everything else has turned into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege spare yourself and your wallet do not make the same mistake and play something more meaningful if this game continues on this path it will die as war thunder within next sixty eight months
if you want massive multiplayer fps then this game is what youre looking for experience global warfare stretching from 8x8 kilometers in real time and with a wide range of vehicles and infantry classes this game is a whole lot of explosive fun
early access reviewso cute yet so spookyscared for life calling people cute is an insult now d i am humiliated for being so for adultsages seven and under1
early access reviewi recommend trying but not investing very much time or money in this flawed product good game but the shuffling algorithm is absolute trash you will get games where you don t draw any mana at all for multiple turns no matter how many you have in the deck the response from most people is that s variance and it s good for the game the problem is this happens way too often as in frustratingly often it happens so often i have contemplated uninstalling the game multiple times however i have the sunken costs fallacy in full effect i have spent money and time so i don t want to see a waste in my investment i suffer on but quit my session shortly after starting due to these failures almost every time frustrated in such wasted potential from an otherwise fun game i would recommend people try this game but with the deck variance being so extreme compiled with a clearly terrible shuffling algorithm you will get a very large amount of nongames games with no mana for you or the opponent equaling an automatic loss for that party
early access reviewdo not buy this game it is a peice of poopalso the grammar is completely incorrect in the game of which has absolutely no good content warmode is just a ripoff of cs go do not buyplus the scope doesnt even work and when i started up the game it was playing at 480p so i had to change the resolution while not even being able to read the words for the settings so i just had to click on some random stuff and eventually got it to 1080p well i have to admit the scope does actually work but you cant see through the scope so if it do ever get this game which you shouldnt you will have to play it like cs go but you will fail and that is why i deleted the entire game after only two hours messing with the resolution and mouse sensitivitydont buy
"so overall the game is ok could use lots of imporvements such as when you roll two doubles in a row on a turn you should not have to go to the lost islands as it seems unfair instead our turn should just be skipped as well as the invite system hopefully we can extend the times in inviteonly games to make it longer and include a text chat for ingame and allow more people in a lobby for more multiplayer fun and if you can make a bigger board for bigger parties and the betting system in the private games i rate this game five thousand, five hundred and ten as i see potential in this game becoming a fun party game for large groups"
love thei filight sim i hold a commerciel fixedwing and helicopter dual rating and this is as close to as real flight dynamics as you can get on a pc dcs is alway progressing and improving the sim you just cant find anything like this out there when it comes to fighter simulations they just mad the su thirtythree more realistic i cant wait for it to challenge my skills i have been a customer for years and will continue to be while on this plane of existance
early access reviewreally good smash heroes remake i would say it is so fundevelopers are really nice peopleits free so try the game outmy sponsor http steamcommunity comgroupsarchreviews
if you like your study sims are willing to take a beating learning them give this a go you have nothing to lose with the free aircraftsadly you have a lot to lose now that ed appear to have lost their respect for steam customers banning members for making any criticism against the game and their business decisions sorry dcs but you have lost my review
early access reviewgood game i enjoyed keep in mind the game is early accessthe good thing this game did was fast paced action and classesthe bad thing this game did is movement and weponsthe ugly thing this game did was forging
enjoy not having the ability to upgrade anything and expect to have to pay real money for every gun you wish to own then this game is for you an obvious cash grab and a paytoplay style is completely unappealing installed it ran it and got as far as the the end of the tutorial before i realized i would never actually get to do anything other than kill one type of animal with a single gun you start with single bolt action rifle with thirty rounds and able to shoot mule deer if you are a f2p this is all you will ever do and this is all you will ever own and you cant even upgrade the sights without paying
the game is the best in its genre people need to understand the mentality of its gameplay you are not suppose to open and play it for hours its a side game a multi task game a coffee game to spend that ten minutes and look forward for the next day to send more dwellers into the wasteland build more facilities breed and expand its gonna be slow its gonna take time but it is worth it because this is your vault with your people some notes for new players the game is free but extremely fair you can cheat some premium items without any repercussions i would personally recommend itthis is a casual game as you dont need to worry too much if you make some mistakes but it has great depth and interesting mechanics to research and improve your vault and make better decisions with that being said it not without its flaws the managing of your dwellers can become a huge chore later on the ui doesnt help since its build for mobiles but that is my single complain i wish they make some improvements there but i dont see that happens especially since its exactly the same game everywhere ios android bathesda pc client windows ten and steam versions unfortunately for those wondering you cant auto sync your game with the mobile version even though all the platforms share the same kind of save file that means that the game doesnt support autosync but you can easily manually take your save files and use them in any other platform i played on different platform so i dont yet have a lot of time f to display here but steam has achievements so yay
early access reviewok my previous review was a bit to long i am new to this game but here it is was having fun shooting others around the same level as me then when i hit level three was put in a game with people many many levels higher using tanks and better weapons i went from a kill death ratio of one death and five kills to eight deaths and two kills uhh balance this already this game is a pay to win period its fubard beyond belief you can say its in beta but its been in beta for three years face it the company doesnt give a crap about quality only your money there are many issues read the following reviews it really isnt worth playing at this point to me i am nothing but connon fodder for those thats paid for everything there ya have it its a piece of junk
worst support ever dont play this title i thought one of the mounts looked neat so i bought one of the dlc packs for the game for me and a friend about a week later my account got hacked and i lost all my resources i had gained in the game i issued a ticket and got a reply what there support said is that there was no way for them to see if the attack was from me or another ip so they would not do the rollback i had high hopes for the game the idea is neat but if you are just going to be one of the many hacked accounts where no rollbacks are given what is the point in playing the game if eventually all your stuff will be gone and you will have to start over then what is the point perfect world has terrible support google around and you will see for yourself terrible response times and no real support when they do get back to you
i have been using several russian language simulators but it wasnt working for me then a friend recommended dota two i had a hard time in the beginning because i hadnt learnt the meaning of the word yet now that i have a whole world has opened for me its so much when except for when u are playing against drow bloodseeker axe viper sniper death pudge or riki1110 would play again
ive been playing this game for a while now and i can tell you that it is the best moba game out there in graphics and moneywise and game play itself i would definitely recommend it
the game gives no instructions at all after scaring off two deer because i couldnt figure out how to crouch i find one i found no button to shoot it runs off into the hideous wilderness and disappears after five feet because of the horrible render distance i say this after playing on the absolute highest graphics available the screenshots and videos do not in any way reflect this peice of crap you have to buy an insanely overpriced membership to get anything but the first gun or even play multiplayer and if you did get it any gun with a scope costs more than one hundred and fifty
all the reasons i can think of this game failed1 horrible lip syncing2 its a glitch simulator3 your parent must be less than three hundred and twenty four sheeps are stone extractors and turns the stone into grass
i like the old school pixelly goodness the variety of classes and mounts is fun too i am not sure how much irl i would commit there is much complaining in various forums id definitely check it out as f2p though
early access reviewhows this game even free such a cool game with no expensive preorder exclusives dlcs or monetization a full free horror game just freaking grab it alreadyalright fair enough this is my review after a first look at spookys house of jumpscares a really cool interesting and original psychological horror game with a cute and simplistic art style the game does a really good job of immersing you into the atmosphere with creeping looking corridors scattered notes and well timed music the jumpscares are spaced enough to not be too common but they do come up at just the right time to scare your off the multiple kinds of enemies to doesnt allow you to get to comfortable but the progression through them is very well made and with a few minigames to add some subtle messages to it this game is totally worth the grab even more so since its free totally recommend it 1010if youre still not convinced i played this game live on twitch so if youre interested to see how it looks heres the highlights http www twitch only managed to make it to room three hundred before my heart gave out but im really pumped to continue big congratz to the author of this fantastic horror game
a for graphics a good selection on maps animals weapons hunting untilities eaven hunting dog s and so much more cherry on the top they keep improoving this game on a regular base last but not least all this has his price
there seems to be a lot of negative reviews on steam about this game especially revolving around the pricing structure and while i agree that the price looks quite high i have to say that i think the items are so good that to me theyre worth the outlay you get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices graphically its stunning especially with everything turned high and running at 60fps with twentytwo cars on the track for which im referring to dtm experience but the hot lapping in the base game with ai turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on i can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because i get lower fps on the same tracks with only a couple of cars out than i do with the twentytwo cars in a full race of dtm same graphics settings for both but with a ten fps drop in the base game sounds are incredible ive never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars gameplay is great especially on the get real setting althought the ai needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake im currently using a razer sabertooth gamepad and once setup it works perfectly but i can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and its the game which will likely push me to make that commitment its that good that ive bought pretty much most of the buyable stuff except for a couple of livery options within just a few days of trying it edit may twentysixth 2016after having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games i can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the pc i own most if not all of the pc racing sims but theres something about raceroom that makes it very special to me and thats the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates from the sounds to graphics to driving feel once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with ai that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience
early access reviewthe tldr here is that if youre looking for something less broken and trash than pubg but you dont quite want to play fortnite with twelve year olds then i guess this game has you covered oh and no youre not that good its just that this game backfills matches with bots this is another battle royale game its right there in the title right next to realm realm royale isnt really doing anything new or exciting outside some minor tweaks to the gameplay of your standard battle royale game you drop into the map from an airship you land find chests to get weapons and abilities then you kill your way to being the last person or squad standing one thing realm royale does do differently is the class sytem in similar games you more or less drop in as the same person no one person has some edge over the other except for skill and mastery of the glitches in the game in realm royale however there are four classes mage assassin hunter and warrior they each play the exact same and can use the same weapons and abilties however they do have small buffs to certain weapons if used and drop into the map with different starting movement abilities the mage can fly the assassin can blink the hunter and dodge roll and the warrior has a super jump there are some other movement abilties such as invisibility or a charge attack but those will have to be forged during the round or found in random chests the other thing the game does slightly differently is the lives system in other games when you take too much damage you go into a bleeding or down state and have to be revived by a squadmate or in the case of solo queueing die instantly you can be further damaged in this downed state and killed but eventually youll bleed out if someone doenst revive you in realm royale however when you go down you just turn into a chicken you can still move and take cover albeit with reduced movement and unable to defend yourself and eventually youll b e back in fighting shape if you arent killed while youre in chicken form you can be chickened three times before you die for good but then you can still be revived by a squad memeber at a forge granted they can afford the revive and arent killed before the rez timer counts down i will say that the choice to put loot inside independantly lootable chests is a great idea it stops me from missing things on the ground because i didnt notice the muddy black texture on top of the muddy brown and it stops the friendship destruction by making them independatly lootable so theres no debating over who gets what you can share the loot if you dont want it and the game smartly places a pickup timer to stop people from stealing your if you turn your back for a microsecond but after the timer runs out its free game this system is actually pretty good i think they need to do a better job letting me know which loot is mine in a pile of new items but overall its decently well implemented i mentioned above that this game backfills with bots this is something i didnt know going in but became really obvious after a single match bots often run straight at you and either have precognition and aimbot or get stuck on geometry and just eat bullets until they die this game doesnt have a lot of players right now so i imagine a large portion of the matches i played were over half filled with bots often the last few players were the only real humans in the match to begin with im not really upset with this because it means that you wont be queueing forever if the game cant matchmake enough people but it is something to be aware of heres the thing right if you want another battle royale game theres probably worse options out there somewhere but right now this game only does just enough to differentiate itself that id only reccomend it if you have a couple of friends willing to download it with you
making you and your best friend worst enemies since warcraft three moba game where you will feed for your first fifteen hundreds hours of gameplay your teammates will hate you and you will furtherly play the games loss on them for your next one thousands hours of game play you will complain on forums and ingame alike how your team is bringing you down and you will â â â â â about elo hell which doesnt exist welcome to dota two youre stuck here now
a diablo style game that seems to have made a ton of fun design decisions i vote it best in class there are many game varieties and i recommend that everyone race as often as you can its a game the achievements are challenging no matter which level you are playing something great could drop at any moment a ton of character build variety you can find a basic item and turn it into an incredibly better item with innovative game currency and relatively cheaply easy to group when you are in the mood the game is frequently updated and the developers are active in the community truly free to play support is responsive the ingame armor and weapon visual effects that you can buy are more expensive than i would like 30ish dollars us in some cases update i deleted the bit about lag being a problem if you have good internet then the newly added lockstep improvements make the gameplay super smooth and responsive so many great changes with the recenly released version twenty the awakening one of the few companies that is continually giving the community what they request
early access reviewthe game is fun but its full of fing noobs who does not how to play mobas plz put a servey in the start to ask if they have played mobas and how good they are and make a tutorial for them plz
"this game rules the variety of specimens makes for great gameplay constantly keeping you focused the notes are a great narrative device the story is great and the cultural references are awesome boss fight at the end is a little too easy but fun none the less one thing that could improve the game if you kept the notes and could view them at anytime once you had picked them upalso spoilers b a sequel with the player from this as specimen fourteen like in the bad ending would rock with like a portable catdos or something of the sort ultimately a great game nine hundred thousand, one hundred and ten"
early access reviewamazing game without a doubt the best f2p ccg that actually doesnt lie when they say is f2p you can get to the top without spending a dime and building competitive decks in a month or two the gameplay can be boiled down to say like magic with the aesthic of hearthstone also the devs take advantage of this being a virtual game by creating cards and effects that would be otherwise hard or impossible to play on realityphysical format once you get throught the tutorial and all that jazz go for the free trial twitch prime and claim the eternal package that contains like thirtyfour packs and join the discord people in there is really helpful and will aid you to get the ropes of the game so try it out in the worst case that you dont like how it is played you can uninstall is free one note tho do not buy packs as you try to build your collection play draft eternals equivalent of arena instead you open five packs choose cards and by the end of the run you get to keep all the cards you picked even if you are bad at it you can just pick the more rare cards and still get good and better value out of it
"take care people once you get into it its like you just signed a pact with devili dont know what im doing with my life anymore i got crush on a eight thousand, five hundred and ten grill we talk a lot n but doto wont let me get any closer than that shes taken too fml"
this game with its cute little out of the wall popups that scared the living light out of me i like it very much i havent played it lately but this is a very good game i like how its a funny jump scare game and it is very very fun but the story is pretty sad so good luck and have fun in the rooms d
early access reviewthe good multiple soldier classes to choose from meaning multiple play styles to utilize and select from separate resources for soldiers and assault teams the ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skills to specialize them how you wish the ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicles by investing time and experience into the previous levels the ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat such as faster reloading reduced damage taken and carrying more ammunition three nations to choose from allowing different gear between factions with few exceptions each soldier can earn more for fighting based on their rank providing an incentive to continue to improve and rank up the ability to give a generals gear to other soldiers of the same faction once said soldier becomes a general the bad each soldier starts with no experience base gear and must play through the same tutorial to start earning credits in battles just by playing experience gain is painfully slow with gains and rewards becoming more insignificant over time until they start becoming not only more miniscule but more timeconsuming as well each experience tree not only unlocks different perks but different items and do not intersect often holding new items in the middle or later stages of the trees each nation unlocks different things in different orders meaning some nations will be able to unlock better equipment at different points such as tanks at least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the generals part of the game unless you purchase a general or highranked soldier using realworld cashall weapons vehicles classes and assault teams can be purchased using realworld currency the only exception is ribbon levels and perks which can be unlocked faster using boosters or a premium accounteach player is thrust into matches with highlevel players randomly upon reaching rank three with one soldier meaning they often face off against vastly superior enemies very early on even the balanced matches are not balanced because soldier numbers on each faction in battle can be uneven to an extent all three factions are treated as separate entities making a game based off of the second world war seem more like a freeforall game spawn points can be easily camped by enemy players using tanks making for a highly dissatisfying battle vehicles can be spawned sideways upsidedown or in the immediate line of fire making highaction points a nightmare to use especially when said points are the only remaining ones to spawn from weapons can be modified to allow for instant oneshot capabilities no matter where the victim is hit frame rate and connectivity is a huge issue especially during high activity in small areas weapons can be modified to allow for extreme fire rates making it nighimpossible to react before one is killed allied players are able to repeatedly kill their own teams with little to no recourse noted as of yet other than a minor loss of experience gaining any type of currency is slow and tedious on top of the high cost of modified and specific gear players can join battles late and end up earning absolutely no reward for participation even if they play a significant role in the battle players can buy the ability to equip two perks a fourth weapon and gain a boost to resources and experience earned through a premium account certain perks either do not seem to work right or are considered overpowered such as the ability to remove the kill camera which is actually the ability to see where you were killed from players can enter matches in which they will be forced to fight against tank players even if their team have none and oftentimes cannot do anything about it other than be crushed this happens even in the balanced game modes ingame wars last an average of twenty three days requiring players to select their server and faction all over again every time one ends even if they themselves did not participate paratroopers cannot jump out of a drop plane that is currently plummeting without incurring a suicide penalty meaning whomever shot down the plane gets a free reward for killing them edit you might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit but you still die instantly once its started to plummetfighter planes have little to no variety and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls players earn a miniscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing and would need to play one battle every day for two hundred and ninetyfour days in order to purchase the lowestranked war bond in the shop which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to three hundred and ten days worth of firstbattle bonuses over half a year meanwhile the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of three hundred and fifty days worth costs under eight usd for whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in early release still please note that this is a personal opinion and an early release review on top of that meaning that as more patches are added this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time as it stands though i cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highlyexperienced or skilled player but also the one who throws money at it and yes i did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point
this game is great but it is so boring to the point where i was yawning while playing this game the huge big flaw is that the early duels are way to easy i have seen no one exept for the legendaries put a card down in defence mode or put down a spell or trap card if you go second in any battle you basicly win if the game decides to give you monsters you can throw down and not just spell or trapsyes that can actually happen i lost twice do to that happening like i said its way to easy early on dont know about later on but when i fight thirty some different people not pvp i should not see the same monster over and over just thrown in attack position with complete lack of any absolutly none not a sigle piece of the ai doing strategy no spells no traps and no defence this makes almost half the spell and traps cards useless because you beat them so hard you dont even need spells or traps except pvp where spells and traps are really important dont just do what the ai do this is basicly a battle in this game the ai throws down one card in attack position and thats it then its your turn to basicly steam roll the ai with actual good cards with traps and spells can i ask who thought that having only three spots to place you monsterstraps and spells on the field this has no regard to strategy even against the legendary duelist beacuse they only rarely put down spells and traps even if they do that half the time they dont even use them so just keep attacking and you win you can win even without tribute summons and fusion summons just use the lvl four and below and you can basicly beat almost every duelist except for pvp which actually has you going against people that know how to play well pvp is so terrible as well its good only if you can stay in a match to completion and not get disconnected and get counted as you lost the game even though you didnt quit then the game kicks you out and you lose just how in what world is this system even fair the ai is pathetic and the only good duels are pvp if you can actually finish and not glitch out this game is good all it needs is a ai update and change the feild so you can put down five monsters or five spells and traps and put in an actual shuffle code so we dont get useless traps and spells when we need lvl four and under monsters plus the pvp fix so its not glithcy and you cant just drop out and lose these things should be easy to fix take the game f e a r even after thirteen years that game still has the best first person shotter ai show me a first person shooter game that has better ai than f e a r the point is if a thirteen year old game still has better ai than every first person shooter than this ai should be even better or at least as good so they just dont throw one monster down in attack once that happens you win they can never get the control back these make it so whoever goes second pretty much instantly wins do to the huge advanteges you get for going second the player who goes first dosnt get to draw a card at the begining of the game and cant attack but the second player gets to draw and attack after the second player goes then the first player gets to draw which im hopeing i dont need to explain how stupid that is all this game needs is a couple of updates and fixes and you have a great almost perfect game but for now stay away from this boring trash
early access reviewcompletely the same as cs go but more fun and also free great game to waist time in anticipation for something runs well find yourself spending hours playing to unlock a beast sniper and having the round end ont the best to play with friends as teamates do nothing in this game but sit there and steal your kills 910freebetter then cs goruns greata great timemultiplayer can be repetative and annoyingsame thing as cs go
early access reviewgunplay fun and overall funhowever whoever is in charge of designing the maps has no idea what he or she is doing at allthe maps in this game are all horribly designed please fix
why this why mobile game on steam i remember playing original world of tanks couple of years ago i grinded so ing hard to get better tier tank matches took so long and you were getting so little experience and credits i finally managed to get to tier five american m4 sherman iirc only to realize how much that tank sucked and then i saw how much more grinding was before me in a bad tank to get anything better thanks but no wot is awfulthen i played the mobile version on my phone and had many more tanks in shorter time also grabbed free tank slots on promos so im not that limited this game looks rather bad is dumbed down but its at least a bit more reasonable in grinding fest it could be better but its still fun especially that you can play on mobile and have same account game still requires a lot of grinding though
i got this game back when it was a paid model and i have to say i do not regret paying for it the devs have been very active and were very generous to the people that help support it when it was being sold before it went f2p thanks for a great game and keep up the great work almost twenty eighteens and still going strong
i truly consider this the great sequel to diablo ii being freetoplay is even greater but do not compare this game with diablo iii for they are different games diablo iii is a game in its own right it deserves the attention for it is very polished and well conceived path of exile has the exact style of diablo ii and although i dont agree with the spamming trade system complicated class skill tree and inability to reroll skill points easily i do praise the developers for starting the game and continuing diablo iis dark legacy in a different lore and graphic engine deserves a one thousand and ten from a diablo fan like myself
early access reviewits a smash bros type game and is pretty easy to get used to the controls but time to time you wil learn that timing and pace is important if you want to climb the ladder in rank other than that have fun playing with friends or people online warning this may destroy friendships
early access reviewall talking is text no voice acting intro is hilariously bad once you get out of hell you fight this op demon night who then throws you ten thousand miles and it shows your body cartwheeling through the air and its downright ridiculous i giggled but what really put me off is the controls and the names i mean really robina the hood and mouselook is only possible if you click and hold and arrow keys just make you turn or go straight i understand this game was engineered to work for mobile as well but it should have been a port not a main focus would only recommend for the most basic easiest to impress player
so far this is the best econmics simulator to i could find online i have seen or been able to simulate door to door selling monopolies pawn shops and one of artwork masterpiece selling its all in the game and you can trade on websites or on a server dedicated to it i cant believe someone could duplicate the feeling so well also a bunch of people on my friends list insist that i just have to try the first person shooter mode of the game maybe ill get to that someday
early access reviewfantastic potential really fun to play just join a game earn points for kills and use points to buy guns and armour in that game hope the gun balancing stays the same and they dont implement a pay to win policy on the guns fingers crossed could do with some bigger maps and a bit stricter policing of hackers which often ruin multiple games in a row that said its free its fun and its definately worth a try
early access reviewwhen i was eight years old i used to play the hell out of aes games specifically dragonfable i then moved on to aq worlds which pretty much sold me into the ideas of mmos now this this is pretty okay but falls short in its current state its not the best game out there but im sure what its lacking will be brought in as the beta progresses one thing that is bugging me right now is that you cant change your characters eye color it is always blue for some reason another thing that is bugging me is that there is no dodge button this may be because i am too used to guild wars two but i feel like this is an mmo where that feature would be perfect active dodging is always a plus rather than rngbased dodge because it requires skill another thing bugging me quite literally are the bugs in this game sometimes the ui messes up and keeps tracking quests when they are abandoned sometimes it messes up by tracking quests ive already done its really annoying now the last thing i will talk about are the graphics i realize that this game was made to be crossplatform but i see no excuse as to why this game must have horrible graphics on pc when pc is the main platform that this games playerbase plays on hopefully these things do get sorted out so i can finally relive my childhood happily
one of the very best online card games more depth and less random than hearthstone game is really rewarding with cards and gold single player solo arena is a fun feature to play at the beginning
early access reviewthe game was so much better when i first played like three years ago now i have a five minute ban because of the new beta i bet they rushed to get released i couldnt connect to a damn game because someone keeps getting disconnected and when we did get disconnected we get a game abondon cool down i literally have the whole thing recorded from trying to join a game to getting kicked and banned
early access reviewthe foundation of this game is awful meaning no fixes they will do will ever fix that problem too lazy to write a real review but just want to add to the stats and help people avoid this game rip my soul
early access reviewthis game is suck and awsomethe part of suck from this game is so hard to earn exp you must kill a player then you gonna earn ten exp the part of awsome from this game is this game is freeand i spend half hour to find a ing single match
early access reviewi like this game its fun i like the art style and i do like the simplicity its addicting havent spent a dime and havent felt i needed too though i will probably throw them a few bucks for the work its beat so expect bugs but nothing a relog wont fix the ui is getting changed as well as most other things i have issues with when ti comes to the pc version i hope it gets popular the community is friendly and helpful when it comes to mobs and quests and the mobs can be tough which i like instead of pushovers like in some mmos
it takes a little dedication to get used to the game the handling is sometimes a little quirky especially when new to the game though when figuring out how the steering exactly works and lap times are going down the game really stimulates you to continue whether on the same track in the same car or in the same competition i didnt buy any vrp currency yet so i havent bought any new cars or tracks but already i managed to spend over twenty hours into the game and i dont play games that much so for me thats a lot if racing is really something you enjoy i would recommend you check it out probably a lot of you will ragequit out because the handling is a thing to get used to however with a little bit of practice even the two free tracks are good to drive on and even when experienced those tracks are great fun and still full of challenge nevertheless if racing is not your type of game this might not appeal to you fully
the game is alright however it would be soooo much better if you just had to pay for the game instead of paying to win you simply cant progress without spending more money than this game is worth its a fun game however its kind of annoying with the ptw aspect
early access reviewbe careful with privacy and data collection the developer intends to collect all the information you have to offer and store it outside the european union where you are not protected by law do not give it freely to them beware of this trick i made it to the start page where you are asked to accept the privacy and data collection and declined therefore not playing the game
one af all my eng its not the best in the world so forgive my grammar mistakes to the game now if you are starter you will see it all good in there grafics gameplay sounds and most of the players are very coaporate with you the problems start when you reach level eight and higher then you start battle with all the payers in the world force you to do the same if you want to survire in there let me make my self clearest if you are level eight or ten or after five hundred hours level twenty and more you will face players with level sixty eighty or one hundred and then the party start there is nooooooooo with no way you can blow up some player in that rank no matter the nation or what kind of tank are you have or they have i found my self shot plenty of timesboys with level sixty and up like i say i fired at them at least thirty shells all kind of shells at every possible weak point the enemy tank have and still no damage in i matter of fact what damage no damage at all and if the enemy shout back on megod help me if i find my pieces out there one enemy shot is more than enough to blow you out i ask about that some others players in there and out there and most of them have some cheaps exsuses that i am not use the right shell i dont shout at the right point and staff like that i try to explain to them that i shout more than thirty times at every possible point and i am not playing alone out there i have witness some friends of mine and all the others try not to see it or undestand it finish in this my complains is huge and no good gameplay or the thousants of payers in there cant hold me for reject this game for good if you have money and want to be the best then that game is for you if you want to try to play with your balls then avoid it like i plague so black for me and i am not suffer to be i puppet out there i want to play equal and fair with everybody else
early access reviewto ensure my sanity every time a card boardcut out pops up i run in t it and kiss it but bout the game i would ay that it is one of the scariest games i have ever seen i would give it a one thousand and ten but if you have heart problems or u are easily scared i recomend that u deffinitly do not play this game
early access reviewthis game is fantastic if you play cs this is a really nice change from it the gunplay is amazing especially the shots just feel satisfying if youre looking for a super realistic game this isnt it but if youre looking for a general shooter with ok graphics and nice fps this is the one for you you cant go wrong its ftp after all cons not many servers russian and us onlyno competitive gamemode only skrimnot many featurespros small downloadgreat gunplayfast load up from my desktop i can be in a game in around twenty secondsits still early alpha9115 one 32am this game may have changed since this post
do not waste your timegame is very glitchy dont spend any money on this game my entire vault after five days bricked and is gone contacted support for refund five days after purchase and was denied for an entire week they finally add items back instead of refunding and one of the packages instantly disappears after i redeem with none of the items applied to my account worst experience with steam and a game ever im going to go outside now and smash my head against a wall its more rewarding than this game
absolute trash ai always lands on the perfect tile for the time either to purchase it just before you land a turn later to pay up or to magically avoid eight of nine tiles you own twenty times in a row9 of ten players use some game engine sh t so you land in jail on first turn and miss all property tiles the first eighty turns until they have the entire board and you have nothing at all play a few games youll catch on to the bullshτt quick edit take my advice and dont join games with any players from or in brazil every person i suspected of cheating just magically happen to be from brazil all nine cheaters all from the same place whod have guessed attempt number two started a game and got three guys from france all friends vs just me all attacking just me some guy who used special characters to avoid a steam ban name was vulgar fr except circles around the vulgar text and the arrow was an actual arrow all of which cant be typed on a keyboard his sockpuppet you59120 and his other sockpuppet keszofr vs only me every chance card went against my three very poor one house cities all while they avoided each other and didnt give a in fact to push things further as soon as id lost the two puppets forfeit the game giving t untypable text name vulgarfr no spaces all the chipsattempt number three faced one of two hundred and twenty eight thousand idiots on steam named tape face with a black hair black white stripes shirt image that appearently hundreds more idiots on steam use incident he landed repeatedly on world tour five times in a row in a ing row and consecutively as in so many times he went from no property to owning the entire same line london to newyork yes picked each tile and landed on world tour after each purchase no fail then landed on chance from newyork purchase on doubles and drew select city for world championships which i then landed on london which just happened to be a festival that he just chose a turn before to be the championships yes all turn by turn no fail no pause pure impossible tthe rest the game he landed two in seven turns on a twenty five thousand property while i landed upwards of three times per pass on those same properties london to newyork its always the cheating ing dip that use either non keyboard text in their name so you cant reportblock ect or the choose a name thats used by a million other users with an image a million other idiots use that use cheats and stupid
i used to love this game a ton i even spent s little money two years later me this game sucks everything is unbalanced and buggy the game has a dppressing and weird feel to it now developers have really ed this game up short version used to be fun now it sucks
team fortress two is a great game with a great community what i love about this game is the large variety of styles classes and ways tp play each class not to mention the large amount gamemodes i would recommend this game to anyone who is a gamer three love this game
this is the game ive invested more time in game and planning than in any other game ever amazingly good and huge game updates keep it interesting and somewhat balanced all the time and there is always something to do or atleast to try there are not enough time to even try all the interesting builds because new ones pop up all the time poe community ingame and in reddit are the most awesome ever if you have problem you can ask for help or buy services like hard boss kills from other players you can play with up to five friends through game or just some time mapping with your best friend or you can be the ultimate lone wolf and maybe play in ssf where you cannot even trade with anyone other than the ingame vendors and masters skilltree where to begin with that it is huge and complex and huge there is always something new to learn and its good thing in these games you can go different routes to same notable and decide to take hp instead of damage or change it later if you just wanted to try out something there are million choices needed to be made considering only the skill tree options are almost limitless tho some decicions are a bit more build enabling than the others you can invest only few hours or couple thousands of hours and i promise that you wont be in the position where you can say that you know everything andor you have tried everything new challenges skills uniques and other mechanics which affect the game and how you can should play it keeps updating every once in a while and new leagues start about in every three months thumbs up good game you should really give it a try
decent port of the mobile game audio sounds higher quality and more crisp extra information on the sides is nice wouldve been nice to see a little bit more utilization of pc hardware but its a mobile game on pc so i cant complain importing data is as easy as importing to any other device so all my progress is synced with my phone and tablet only thing thats kinda bothering me is the lack of japanese voices the english and korean voices are there but not the japanese voices for some reason
i like this game its not poors wot only noobs cant play this this is harder to play whit android phonethis game its great and i like it so muchits better than wot whit less cheaters
excellent game i much prefer this to minecraft its fun to build and its fun to explore there is a great selection of blocks some available as dlc but i have been playing for years and still have not finished buiding everything i want with the blocks that come free the game looks great for a block game making wandering and exploring very fun there is a daynight dynamic to the monsters you can encounter but they cant dig and never blow up your buildings so early on you can easily avoid monsters you are not ready to encounter yet it has a few bugs but they are easily overshadowed by the fact that this game is fun i have played this for one hundred and thirty hours so far which is about one hundred hours more than any other game i have ever owned
cant even get into this game without it crashing nothing but a complete joke pick ya god damn act up absolutely pathetic would never recommend this to anyone nothing but a joke and a complete waste of time
pay two win basicly sums up the gameto get sub classses payto use most of the stuff u get in starter gear pay to wincoupons in the game u get from starter gear still need to paylittle explanation about some things but other things greatly explainedso yah pay two win
ok so for the past few games ive been logging onto trove only to find out i cant click anything that being said i cant craft anything have to force exit the game and cannot join my friends parties on top of that the camera glitches so bad ill be running somewhere and suddenly the camera will turn around has this happened to anyone andor how do i fix this problem because i really like trove but with these problems im getting sort of annoyed to the point i dont want to play anymore i used to play this game no problem and not pay for anything i would just grind to get what i needed now youre telling me i need to put my life savings into this game why
for the record i played this game for at least six hundred hours before the steam launch the only reason i started playing was because i happened to get the alienware ra skin right after beta had ended i didnt expect much from this game at first but since it is a moba and the only other moba ive played was dead island epidemic i wanted to try it i dont regret my decision at all i love this game so much and i will never stop playing it i usually never put money towards any free game but this was the first exception and i definatly got my moneys worth the only cons i see for this game are the same ones that are present in any multiplayer game badsalty players and people that complain about the cost of things because mommys credit card cant handle it anymore glhf and happy smiting
my opinioni understand the negavtive reviewsbut i have spent a lot of money on this gamebut thats becouse i enjoy it you can play whitout spending moneythey give new free species to hunt every weekand if you want a good budget expirience you have to pay like twenty five at the startfor a good riflei recomend the 300suiti recommend bone crocket and callers and then ten per three months if you dont want to play it anymore you can just stop paying so that is my opinionhave fun and hunt on
do you like planes and tanks are you tired of games like world of tanks constantly on its free two play playerbase did war birds not have enough variety for you then this is the game for you how does it control it has both arcade and realistic game modes to suit anyones needs a very fair f2p system tons of interesting battles play this game
pay to win garbage fun until you run out of medalions and you have to grind in assault mode against people who have better units than you pros colorfulfun for a little whilegood conceptcons p2wnear impossible for new playersgets too grindy
i cant play the game beacuse the tutorial is glitched for me and i cant fix it there are only thirtytwo cards in my collection but you need fifty for a deck but the game thinks i have fifty
its incredibly fun in a realistic wowthisishard but rewarding sort of waythe planes are lots of fun to fly by themselvesthe missions are different and keep you on your toesyou dont need crazy expensive controllers to have a good time with this gamei use keyboard and a twenty five logitech extreme 3d proflying with friends is awesome you can edit the single player campaign to make them coopalways people to fly with in multiplayer and most seem to be willing to help noobs like myselfa little advice expect to get rekt the first few times you play the learning curve is steep but well worth it once you figure out how to play
my mother had purchased the fifty membership pass after adding funds she got the email confirming the purchase but after the wait time was over the items were not transferred to my account and i tried to get help through a ticket i received a response but it never went farther than thatupdated and restructured the report i made because the grammar and other things were hurting my eyes0my stance on this game is still negative but i will still play it without purchasing anything
good simple fun graphics are excellent community if friendly and noninvasive best of all its free while there are microtransactions you dont need them if youre patient
early access reviewi believe that this game has a tooooon of potential especially to outweigh some of the other competition the fact that this is on steam where many people heavily rely upon to play the majority of their games the chances of someone trying out the game increase tremendously in addition itll be much easier for the developers to get purchases of battle passes and whatever else they may add due to the fact that the steam wallet is much more flexible as people are more likely to have leftover money after purchasing other games or items on steam this is my list of pros and cons during early access specifically alpha pros gameplay pros clean ui easy to understand symbols balanced classes for the most part and also from what i can tell marked points on the minimap show up as transparent pillars in the map very useful at all stages of the game a different style of dropping no parachuting which is a nice touch for the pace of the game dispersion of chestsloot is nice as you wont find things too close or too far away from each other variety of weapon choices class specific weapons abilities if you kill another player you will not be able to use their stuff if it is class specific tiers of weaponsarmor common uncommon rare etc forging is very unique allows for gameplay to be more indepth toggleable mountvehicle for longer distance travel i like how it disables when you go indoors as well as the cooldown damage indicators pretty good hitregistration for its first week of play map pros very detailed map with different biomes like an ice one forest desert etc in the four corners graphics are pretty nice for a free game topography is shown which is super cool lets you know how elevated a surface is so you can know if one spot is a mountain or not etc labels for places in the map as well as specifics where every forge in the map is and block coordinates a1 a2 b1 b2 etc other pros region selection for matchmaking not paytowin party finder for those who do not just want to fill lobby customizable options for crosshair reticles audio video etc controller support for those who would like a challenge i guess haha player rating does not affect matchmaking queue as of now however i would like there to be a list of ranks so we know how were rated report feature voice chat i personally havent used it that much but it seems fine the horse is very buff and the chicken is awesome d cons gameplay cons limited inventory to two weapons the three max abilities is entirely fine no indication of weapon statistics after picking up when opening your inventory the only option is to swap its slot from one or two is now in the game no indication of the flight path before dropping no manually reviving teammates the chicken mechanic is nice but not always ideal sound cues are not always accurate or loud enough this goes for me as well as a couple of my other friends who all have different headsets turtle beach logitech razer etc when opening chests potions and other items may appear stuck inside of it which makes it tricky to find an angle that lets you pick it up auto pickup when running over it now unable to drop potions you can drop them with ease now only third person five thousand and fifty sometimes these royales are better or worse with only tp i am personally fine with both choppily moving zone however thats expected from an alpha game map cons minor bugs with the landscape ive run into a couple floating bushes or things didnt render properly uncommon though also note that i have the highest graphics settings no current zoom mechanic on minimap other cons no current qa or common questions people may have regarding mechanics may lead to confusion or people to believe something that is false such as the chicken thing and disenchanting qabasics as well as patch notes ingame good stuff model stiffness sometimes the animations just stop and the character goes into the gmod tpose fixed now no colorblind mode yet which would be extremely helpful for people like me who have difficulties differentiating the colored tiers of items tabbing out can take some time occasionally crashing the game not sure how often this will occurtaking all of this into consideration the game seems to be going in a pretty good direction i hope that the developers are very responsive throughout development and later in the games progress i personally am not a huge fan of battle royales i tend to play them more casually however i expect this game to be pulling in some more of my hours overall this game is a nine hundred and ten and you should definietely consider trying it out especially since it is free
early access reviewhello if you hear me can you unban me maybe you dont understand i am from lithuania and ten for a video game that is not very popular or amazing no hate your game is challenging and fun and ten for a free game is alot i am not like you you millionaires
created 092516fractured space is a game about driving your gigantic spaceship into epic 5v5 team battles on vast maps with sectors of up to one hundred kilometers length there are currently thirtythree ships available to play where they are split into three manufacturers wich each boast their own distinctive artstyle and unique systems games can be played in the two currently available gamemodes conquest and frontline where the first feels somewhat like a good old moba and the latter like a fast king of the hill match with basecapture elements ships can manouver almost completely free though you are unable to roll and only limited tilting is possible though this goes to ensure that certain ships can function the way they were designed and combat gets more challenging more on that later movement between sectors is achieved via a phaserelocation also called jump wich keeps both your orientation and momentum fractured space features a very high depth of mechanics wich might not jump your thought immediatly and will require some getting used to such as the concept of armor and breaking armor causing you to take increased damage from enemy fire fractured space due to its high depth delivers lots of potential for very tactical play and thus has huge potential to become an esport in the future here are my personal scores for the game graphics nine hundred and ten the unreal engine delivers again and so do the artdevs from edgecase games beatifull lookssound solid eight hundred and ten despite the usual no sound in space thing fractured space features a really immersive soundscapedepth nine hundred and ten in terms of depth fractured space beats most mmosas ive yet seen may be a bit to much for the casual player character design nine hundred and ten the ships you play feel very very unique and become so even more with loadouts and crew gameplay seven hundred and ten gameplay is a bit unintuitive at times but a well done tutorial helps with the tremedous depth of the game now do i recommend fractured space hell yeahits one of the most revolutionary spaceshooters ive ever seen and the unreal engine makes it just so nice to play and look good the game is fair and balanced no cheaters to bee seen since the game started there is payed content to the game but this completely restricts itself to skins giving you the cool looks but nothing else while you can also buy credit boosters to simply get your next ship faster that being said a more expensive ship doesnt mean you will have an easier time having a newer more expensive ship gives you absolutely no advantages over other people now there are some players i defenitly dont recomment to touch fractured space because the game takes quite some effort to be successful in so just quickly jumping in for the pure ownage will likely not work out
"fighting depression was hard really hard i had to suffer through life being builled by fat s and y brats until i found this game this game opened the lock to my heart i never felt so alone again i now have vitual waifus and playing with only one hand this has cured my depression and lost my parents trust best game in humanity one thousand, one hundred and ten"
a very fun alternative to crafting games such as minecraft its very original and i can respect that all worlds are online making playing with friends easy the way its set up encourages you to venture out for that one thing you need in order to craft that one thing that will help you this game has a huge variety of creatively designed mobs and im glad to see if theyl add even more to the game
honestly a really fun grinder game with lots of different tactics and styles you can set up so many kinds of builds the game itself progresses relatively quickly compared to some clicker games not to mention while this is free it doesnt force its pay elements down your throat rather its something i personally bought a bit of to support the team behind the game give it a shot
"i actually really like this game i play it with friends and we play it a lot for all the people out there that complain about the game being too expensive the f2p side of the game is basically a demo to see if you enjoy the game if you like it you can buy the fifteen membership which gives you all the basic essentials needed to play the game the game needs money to survive and become more developed its not like the game could be successful if no one bought anything and everything was free i think the fifteen is well worth considering you can hunt everything and they give you everything you need to hunt everything but thats just my opinion well developed and updated game nine thousand, five hundred and ten scary as when charged by a bear"
this reminds me of valves new artifact game everyone was excited for half life three but they got a crappy dota card game everyone was excited for elder scrolls six but then we got this anyone else see the similarity its not a bad card game though either
early access reviewthe new patch ruined the game for me the damage changes has made my mage feel extremely weak i run out of mana after thirteen mobs killing one mob takes freakin 1m game going a bad direction now
this game was fun until the job costumes wore off and the realization that any of the actual costumes must be paid for with actual money finaly sunk in basicly to build the character you wanted from the start you must buy buy and buy all of the costumes for maximum customization would be a good game but still would not recommend
early access reviewwas fun until they blew it first they got my money for one game and then on a single monday night turned it into an entirely different game probably done with hirez
if you do not like grinding games this is definetly not one for youthat being said if you like to collect items and different cosmetic styles this is definetly a game for you they have recently added pvp beta and shadow towers like small raids and the game keeps updating altough i think the game is great no game is without their own problems server downtime is one of those but and this is a big but the servers are getting more stable every patch the game has come a long way since last i played it and i have gotten hooked on it again altough i can get random crashes for no reason the game is fast to restart annoying yes but dosent matter that much but aslong as you send reports the issues will be fixed eventuallyyou can also build like in minecraft and make music and so on there exist alot of clubs to just hang around in and explore what others have built all in all this is a great game
product received for freeearly access review fantastic cooking fungameplayyou are dropped into a random part of the map after a loading screen of clouds first thing you will notice is the game is actually really decent looking with odd running animations the game already has parkour and many many gunsand pots and pans to cover your a opening doors is very loud which is good and bad it might be louder just on your own client the game only has thirty people in it for the moment which seems to be great for the map size the map is fantastic and looks alot like francegermany in ww2 which is not surprising as this is a ww2 mod the guns shot well but could do with some improvements the end game is scary as hell wierd noises that sound like youre mothers bedroom on a sunday night the starting screen leaves alot to be disered but its still early days the best thing about the game i would say is it has its own spin on it and no boring building tl dri would give it a solid seven hundred and ten needs more work and all that but its great fun
best game this game is the best horror game of the timeline holy my dad still hits me though
a cool hunting game i can confidently say looks good feels good and most of all you can hunt with your friends now for what i really think this game should not be free to play because its really not you have to pay if you want to have anything more then one gun and two licenses for animals you will never find it should be called free to download because its far from free to play all to make money i guess false advertising to draw you in then its pay to play from there i do not recommend this game because of its pay to play style if there was a up front cost i would have a different opinon
early access review1 much better to have algrothm for auto equip the pick up weapon parts2 compare to circle the pologon is harder to determine if player is in the safe zone or not3 very interesting reflection algrothme concept for water metal and floor
been playing smite since beta and it get better every single patch the art work the modes and the new gods are incredible since they are all tied to real life myths and legends also hirez is the king of value the god pack gives you every single god in the game and every single new god forever not to mention the constant barrage of free gemfavor and worshiper events fantastic free to play model where i never feel bad buying something ive been to the hirez studios in atlana and the passion they have for this game is undeniable you cant go wrong with this game download it
daft little sim build game set in the fallout universe it uses their quirky satirical humour as you try to build a sufficient fallout shelter to save as many as you can at times i run out of moneythings to do as this is more of a facebookfarming game than anything else but its still pretty engaging
early access review1510better then mc in my personal opinioneasy to create a world to play with your friends or alonesetting restrictions on chests and similar stuff to avoid thiefsgreat perfromance without lags or fps issuesgreat gameplay land wink winkvery nice crafting systemupdate one downside i have now is the premium introducted to the game which essentialy makes it like mc paid game as a f2p user you have pretty much no control over your server settings which is very sad but other then that i still stick to my previous positives writen above
rus я не могу сказать что это идеальная игра но это круто там есть танки и ясно что игра о танках я честно советую кто хочет расслабиться и поиграть в танки eng i can not say that this is the perfect game but its cool there are tanks there and it is clear that the game is about tanks i honestly advise who wants to relax and play tanks

"absolutely not worth your time i promise you the game is made so that you will be outgunned nine hundred and ten games and you roam from match to match losing all your tanks immediately the shell hasnt done any damage voice line will be burned into your ing brain from my experience i feel as if the game is purposefully gimping you with the already dice rolls this game heavily relies on luck the game is based around a br system x0 x3 x7 ten thirteen seventeen and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down one point of br which is ing broken most of the time id like to see tanks around my level or one abovebelow mine instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are one whole br above you meaning your best tank is worthless if your best tank is worthless all the ones below it are useless the second i researched a tank past thirty thirty seven i immediately saw an insane rise in my br battle rating versus everyone else once in a blue moon i can penetrate the tanks i find otherwise i am either getting ed by enemy armor or my own team not defending a point i went from getting five hundred and ten kills a match to getting maybe one or two sometimes zero this is not a matter of skill because i can outflank the enemy team like a ing mythical norse god and still be useless because i put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank while this guys brigade of super heavy forty seven tanks turn around and all over me i cant count the number of times ive seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through forty ing trees arcade is ing useless it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by five hundred if there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game the second your name pops up fifteen tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn heat shell with the accuracy gungnir if you even attempt realistic without three thousands hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier if you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every ing aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you robbing you any chance of having fun so they almost have a good game here but they wont fix the dice rolling they wont fix the matchmaking range they wont fix to make a good game i dont mind the grind at all which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers they wont because it heavily insentivizes people to get premium and buy their way through the grind in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their 105mm wand it is such an incredibly fustrating and unrewarding experience once theyve roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that one hundred and ten game is not worth it i rarely got matched with high br until i really got into the game dont even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single ing stray bullet i would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging theyve got going on edit tanks and aircraft are also seperated in ranks these ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about one thousand, seven hundred and twenty seven in br although the ranges vary based on the nations you play my point being is one hundred of the tanks in france rank one are unplayable and i am not exaggerating in the slightest to compare the worst i did with a tank in rank one germanyusa in war thunder was something like twelve spawns and seventeen kills i never had more deaths than kills in war thunder until i tried the french the french are so bad i had a tank with seventeen spawns and two kills another tank with seventeen spawns and five kills one tank with eleven spawns and one kill the only only time i could get kills was pure and absolute luck with finishing off someone elses target while i hit weak spots in the back which sometimes took many shells or shooting a notoriously terribly armored tank bt5 it was baffling how these tanks were incapable of penetrating even the worst of tanks non of the starting tanks would yield their sweet death to me including the japanese even when i managed to penetrate the amount of time it took me to lob fifty eight shells into a single tank only gave teamates enough time to finish them off just because you couldnt finish off their crew im sure if you google french rank one tanks you will see everyone agrees"
early access reviewit used to be a play to win game and it was fun but then turned into a pay to win and now is just and the game is also buggy edit two february two thousand and seventeen decided to give the another shot to the game at the first match the game gave me an error that made the game freeze and then crash it took two weeks to have a reply of my ticket turns out i cant play at steam and i lost a 24h premium that they dont have refunded so yeah this game is not worth your time
early access reviewwriting this review i aknowledge that this game is still in its infantry beta phase so obviously it is a very unfinished game but with that said this game needs a lot of work even in beta the first noticeable thing are the clunky cameracharacter controls controlling your character just feels akward and the fact that you have to constantly readjust the faulty camera doesnt really help theres little to no soundmusic fighting enemies gets boring awfully fast and the graphic style is kind of lackluster in short this game has a long way to go you can play and give your feedback if you wish it is free after all but if i were you i would just wait for it to progress
trove is the lovechild of spiral knights minecraft and wildstar put togetherthis game is truly massive it has lots of unique things to do i promise you this youll play for one hundred hours and never get bored the possibilies are truly endless with this but dont take my word for it try it for yourself
for me the fact that this is a direct mobile port to pc isnt too big of an issue my only gripe with this game is that it arrived in north america censored well that and its freemium pricing tactics
just started this game and i am now addicted to it it have a really nice visual and the battle elements the landscape and the way you can create party with friends is so damn fun if you are bored and you like games that are semigrindy but have an rpg element then this is the game for you so jump right in
fractured space reviewimpressions video version https www youtube comwatch v5bpzcxike7agameplay moba overtheshoulder shooter with abilities different types of ship wasdspacectrl to move mouse to aim and shoot crew tactical comms captain engineer a i navigation officer intro fractured space is first and foremost a freetoplay game it was developed and published by edge case games and was released on september twentysecond two thousand and sixteen winner of the pax west award for best moba in two thousand and sixteen fractured space is a game where you are assigned with badass spaceships to take over the other team s facilities and enemy base with the help of your fellow comrades and ship crew gameplay for starters this game is hard even while playing against an ai the difficulty of controlling the ships is as hard as if you were controlling an actual big ship your team consists of four other ships that go against five enemy ships your crew includes a tactical a captain an ai a comms am engineer and a navigation officer that will communicate via radio alerting you to system destruction facilities taken new enemies in sight or allies down your team must create a strategy in order to take down the enemy ships and use their respawn time to take over the facilities in each location to follow until you can get access to the enemy base and win the game while needing to pay attention to the enemy ships that spawn you also need to control your facilities capture new ones beware ships that are shooting you take cover and make sure you re not destroying the ship by hitting meteorites on your way phew seems like a lot to do just in one go just wait till you see the minimaps there are five locations in each round these being the home base beta one and two alpha one and two gamma and enemy base on the minimap you can see how many facilities are in each location how many are under your team s control how many under the enemy s and how many teammates are there as well as the number of enemy ships battleships there are different kinds of ship such as attack defense and utility even though you can relate to most moba that these types are the usual dpstankhealer system each ship has their own way of handling shooting and gameplay attack ships are as expected specialised in ship destruction but they can go from sniper to bruiser ships defensive are the ones that hold the front line and have their own squadron of fighters to help them some even have repair drones that surround them during the combat making them tougher to deal with and utility are ships that focus on supporting their comrades not just by healing but with abilities that buffs and clean debuffs their speed and attack effectiveness also change depending on your ship of choice and abilities vary according to the ship you choose you can give the ships a try and see how each of the abilities work i strongly recommend trying them because on the firing range there are tips of how to play correctly with each ship presentation the ship s design looks great specially with the various skins for each their texture and color palette turned out really good and you can appreciate them from each side and detail shown in the ships the scenery is amazing some locations seem to have been taken from a scifi film production though it doesn t seem to vary that much i felt specially satisfied with the jump sequence since it has been well planned for the game and reminded me of the millennium falcon hyperdrive or the enterprise warp jumps the game s sound effects are flawless and wellexplored though the voice acting for the crew seems a bit too robotic and a quite stereotyped the epic soundtrack brings you the feeling of being in a real scifi space war conclusion considering that i played this game for nearly five hours and i plan to play more of it in the near future the amount of twentyfive dollars worth five hours were definitely worth the hours spent playing for free seeing the final product its easy to notice that a lot of time and effort have been invested in this production since it s a free game our real question here is whether it is or isnt worth wasting your time to play it well i ve played this game for four hours and was getting as excited as a child to see my ranks and stats going up i got impressed with it s visual art and gameplay even if it was a bit hard at the beginning you may get a bit bored from some repetitions in scenery sometimes it may be just a bunch of asteroids on the way and that s it and your crew s orders and reports it is a fun game to play with friends though teamwork is important here in order to create a strategy and make sure someone don t just pop into a location and gets killed because they were alone well seing the overall it is a very fun and beautiful game that you can enjoy playing nonstop for hours it s cost for the buyers is lower that the cost of production and even if they wanted to establish a price of say twenty dollars for the game it would be worth it since it s free i don t see a single reason why you shouldn t spend the next five hours having an amazing time with this game what are you waiting for go download it live long and prosper y allreviewed by almatari
what it used to bethe entire system is designed to entice you into paying for something so naturally balanced and engaging gameplay is of no concern to the developers do not waste your time or currency on this if you are looking for a proper game
early access reviewugh another one of these if you like battle royale well here is more of the same this is more of a cartoon stlye game with a class systemno base building like fortnite power up before taking on your enemies
gamigo just bought trion and now they are gonna do what they know best milk it until it diesthe game itself was a fantastic idea it didnt deserve those companies running it also it went downhill since the gem boxes updaterip trovef
early access reviewpots and pans for armor world war ii occupied france as a setting with german soviet and american weapons dank food for heals booster items that will make you giggle like the kneepads of speed or the bunny slippers of bounce the engine is super well optimized for a game that started out as a joke makes some other game look like a complete joke itself when you look at it gameplay feels amazing and killing other cuisiniers feels super rewarding the player count per match might be lacking but that can be fixed over time i hope they add poutine as heals too sometime in other words this game is awesome some might not like it but i sure damn do kitchen warfare at its finest one thousand and ten
if you like capital ship combat arenas like dreadnaught or even the idea of piloting spaceships in general then you will like this game the combat is great with many ships to choose from whether you like to be the big and slow leviathan or the small and nimble hunter the daily reward system does not punish you for taking a break from the game there is a surprising but somewhat shallow level of customization there are quite a few gamemodes to choose from and the option to play either pvp or vs ai there are quests that encourage you to break out of your shell and try ships you may not normally play there is a satisfying grind to the game though it can get a bit shallow once you unlock the one ship you only play as the only issue i have had is frequent crashes but i play on a laptop and there is the ability to reconnect to matches you have lost connection to overall this game is a great example of a ship vs ship game and i highly recommend it to anyone seeking a new free to play game to play
im deeply wondering how the hell this game with so many bugs issues gets a very positive reviews even just from regristration and the faxemail support from the perfect what the hell world is really frustrating a note for game master youd better delete it if you didnt want to fix those bugs you bug
early access revieweven tho the game is in alpha much smoother than competitors and much more fun no build system and feels alot better still a litttle unbalanced but hey its an alpha enjoyed every second so far
this game is pretty fun a lot of the reviews say you need to pay to do anything but thats not the case you can get the things you pay for through quests wastleland quests little quests found while exploring and objectives i get on the game usually once per day to collect resources level people and skills up send people on quests and into the wasteland and collect supplies from people returning i usually turn on this game and collect things while i read there is a bit of waiting with training and people going to explore and get to quest objectives but its a nice thing to keep up in the background while reading
i really like this game its a refreshing change to clicker heroes there are many classes that actually specialize in certain things and give you the ability to create a loadout of heroes to properly deal with any situation you come across the quests for each level are straightforward and the objectives help you gain gems the ingame currency pretty quickly for any clicker veterans in the end this is a great freetoplay and id definitely suggest it to anyone looking for a new clicker experience
early access reviewbest battle royal out there iv played pubg fortnite and son i was even playing roe when it was only avalible in thailand the map is amazing and the variety of transport is great car snowbord glider gondaler and skimobile the wepons are great and has an awesome variety the game machanics work great and are super smooth you don not need to buy the game pass to win but its there id you want it this is a true free game with some micro transactions but you dont need to buy them to win im addicted to this game and so are my friends its great fun playing solo or as a squad
theese are one of first games i played on my gaming pc and it worked just fine but then it updated a lot sense i lasted played and now it lags like crazy if you have good internet this is the game for you
the game is very fun and a good time waster although its becoming more like its bigger brother in other words its evolving into a pay to win game or should i say devolving its quite obvious that wargaming wants your money nearly all game developers wants money but it shouldnt be this extreme i know its not that extreme but as of the looks of it it will become very extreem indeed the game also needs alot and i mean alot of work on the matchmaking the tiers are very good indeed but when it comes to tank types it needs heavy work its not fun coming in a game with only lights on your team and the enemy is only heavys and tds for example as of right now the game is recommendable at a debateable level but if it keeps becoming more pay to win ill unfortunatley not recommend it dont go the british heavy line lol
early access revieweven though this game is just in alpha early access the game has been very well maintained and very fun to play if this was the work of hideo kojima id give it a one thousand and ten
elsword reviewthe game overall is perfect the controls to the gameplay i have been a player of elsword since its early days of releasement way before it was even considered a steam release i have been playing for all well over a few years of this game and i can say alot has changed through out the updates like how chungwas added to the game and etc all that goodness overall great game just that i stopped playing for various problemslike my premium items that i bought for unlimited time like no seven days stuffis all gone so i got and bored at the game but other than that little complaintthe game its self is great
it is a pay to win game uneven match making putting tanks that have no uses on teams that cant hurt the other side where machine guns kill you faster than and seventy five cm shell it is a money sink cant sell you old tanks trying to force to too buy new slots
early access reviewthis game has a lot of potetial but since it is in early access it still has a long way to go personally i found some of the dailogue to be pretty funny the thing i dont like right now is the lack of items in shops compared to aqw
quick pros and conspros its nostalgicits extremely fun at the startfalloutits freeit kills free timecons you can pay to get everything fasterit gets repetitive and boring if you dont payif you buy something and delete the save file u wasted your moneyno skill involved710
i dont know where to start this is the first time i feel the need to write a review i spent thirty minutes reading reviews on forums and here in steam eight thousand and ninety negative and that comming from players with 2k to 7k hours spent on the game about the last patch and as someone who has played this game since dota one ive seen a lot of changes some were good and some ofcourse not but you couldve get along with them and even start to like them however this last update seven hundred is not like them it completely changes everything to add so much new things in one time its so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero is different now the supports are carries and the carries supports its like i have no knowledge of the game about the visuals the new hud is really small keep in mind many people play on standart laptops size one hundred and fifty six and the health bar is hard to watch when its on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar it will really be good if after all the changes you get the option to adjust all of those for example to expand the hud like the map size i would like as many others the new update to be a new game like dota three so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch six hundred and eighty eight we all like but i know this wont happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional players dont say something if the idea of this update was to draw more people to the game keep in mind is it worth it and will they be more than the one leaving it i personally wont be playing it unless some drastic changes take place which most likely wont happen
early access reviewthe game is good but the crafting system is awful you have to wait a long time to be able to get the item you crafted even at low level what the hell and this game is nothing compare to aqw
this game cannot run with my logitech controllers plugged in neither of them can be plugged into my computer or they will completely override the games controls the screen will always move to the right no matter what if either controller is plugged in logitech extreme3dpro joystick and logitech dual action game controller nothing is being pressed down on either one not one button is being used i have disabled both of them in windows yet your piece of game still thinks they are moving the screen around and the buttons for a b x y on the game are flashing rapidly as if someone is pushing all the buttons and holding them down again not one freaking button is being pushed and i am not about to go behind my desk and unplug two good controllers because your piece of game cant figure it out deal with this now
never been ban from any game nor have i cheatedhacked in any game my account however got hacked into and the person who did proceeded to hack and cheat getting my account banned when i contacted hirez for support they did nothing and left my account banned
if you are looking for a ww2 flight simulator this definitely its not your game of course have good graphics and some physics but its all seems more a call of duty with plane skin and youll see planes with doubtful flight model weapons not working realistically because of hit detection problems and other issues multiplayer missions and map designs forcing players and planes to act weird different than an aerial combat of ww2 high altitude bombers flying low strafing ground targets interceptors attacking ground targets ground attackers joining in dogfights bombers joining in dogfights bomber hunters afraid to attack bombers planes of the same team attacking each other in rarest times you can see any cooperation as aerial squadrons and so on and dont get surprised if your prop plane of the ww2 got in a match against a jet of korean war era its pretty normal there well they said game still in beta phase so they need fix and implement a lot of things yet if you want give a try be my guest
i play it on first mobile 200hand i play it this on notebook 300hnow i play it this on steam hit is a really addictive stuff be careful i have spoken this to good to be real for free for the bug if you lose your save you need to sign in one another pc and thats download the cloudsaving for me thats working if i have thats save issues bug meet pleasure
so heres me a big kid bascially hung over one day and this game this game made everything so much worse unresponsive laggy and just a quick knock up of what could have been a really cool game
early access reviewwhen i played this game last summer it was very fun and enjoyable and i dont remember it being much of a grind it was a complete blast to play with friends but unfortunately i can not say the same now this gamelike almost every free to play title has now decided to go down the pay two win route if you want to get a gun it will probably take you hours upon hours just to unlock it that is unless you want to pay real money of course it is a damn shame because this game had a lot of potential for a free to play game but unfortunately falls flat on its face due to its heavy shift towards pay two win
early access reviewplayed this game since set one drafting is fun and balancing the ladder games are not too tedious and in general it is a game i play on and off pretty much every week and still enjoy so for what thats worth i think it is a very solid game
do you like card games do you like the elder scrols universe well this game is going to be a blast for you its free to play and in my opinnion pretty rewarding even when you dont pay anything i feel that i am still doing well in pvp even though i havent spent any money wich is a big plus for me should you play this game i would say yes i been playing it every day before i go to work just a couple of games and itâ s still for fun for me off course like i said in the beginning you need to like card games for this being a title you should pick up i made a longer review on youtube wich you can find here https youtu bet29p9x5yguc
i love this gameits so much fun three monster and three spelltrap card zones dont even bother me i dont have much play time on steam because i always played it on my phone good port
uodated dec two thousand and eighteen fun free game with appealing graphics but kind of pointless after a while updated for dec twenty sixteens patch the devs ruined the game imagine you were a shop keeper in the soviet union sounds fun huh not price controls were implemented to prevent people from being too successful and having fun why on earth would they do that
not going to lie this game is pretty fun why a negative review you ask because of how unbalanced this game is i am following someone for so long putting thosands of shots into them some plane comes out of no where and puts two twenty round bursts into him and he dies guess who should get the kill after three criticals the guy that comes out of no where and puts two bursts into him for some reason im fighting people in tier two with p51s and yak7s and i have two planes that are the last one in tier one also this game has a major russian bias i play realistic and everytime my squad gets instantly one shot by yak7s and there is nothing we can do about it eventually i got tired of the bias and said if we cant beat em join em so i got the first yak you can get and im amazed most countries dont get cannons till the middle of tier two but hey the first russian plane you can research has a twenty mm cannon i took it into an arcade match and i could shoot three bursts and the plane would litterally tear into peices do not play this game
soooooo very not free to play you have to buy zen in order to do anything or get anywhere in the game cant take professions without purchasing profession packs andor keys for the life boxes in addition to the free to play not is the constant constant crashing of the game client or the severe lag suffered if you can miraculously stay connected at all i really like the game quests and world too bad it is not maintained and expensive to play
bad reviews are based on the fact it is not entirely free to play and for this game the money is worth the membership this is a hunting simulation the best hunting simulation out there might i add with a large variety of animals to hunt many very detailed hunting reserves with stationary hunting towers pretty well full customised loadouts for your hunting trips a massive arsenal of weapons handguns bows shotguns rifles and even muzzle loaders ie black powder you cant go wrong if you are into these games this is the best one ok so these people made the game put their time and money into it and a very well made game with amazing graphics and realism whats wrong with paying a few dollars considering the base program is free so many people do not even understand the concept of this and that explains the bad review i have played this game for over three years now on the non steam client and i will continue to play
early access reviewthis is straight up ballsack i do not reccomend wasting your twenty minuites downloading this sack of you have to literally pay like twenty bucks cash for the basic coins package because its in pesos or euros or some stupid wtf blizzard010
""
well mini update i dont play this anymore for the time being i stopped liking grind mechanism but my point on the review stands still recommend it lets list some things free to play with some premium content as expected at least they give you the oppotunity to earn some currency with ship these items missions sometimes the premium content is deceitfull when you lack one resource the refill button inside the craft menu is for refilling only the necessary mats to craft it not the full storagegood artwork and slight animations music needs improvement lot of content collectionist can rejoice here actually cooperative no pvp the small pvp factor is only there to help your city grow without harming the enemy citytimers yes long timers at higher levels but they advance while offline so you can log in a few times on the day while doing other things irl this feature for some players may be a chore
an amazing flight sim not for the casual gamer i would suggest but for players who want to spend all the momey into getting a top notch flight sim and like some other top flight sims out there some body looking to spend the money time efort into learning how to fly weather it it is recreational flying bush planes or working your way up to flying for an airline i myself am a real world pilot and been flying bush planes for twenty plus years now and i am always on the look for a top notch flying sim to keep logging hours in different type of situations i might find myself in my own plane getting into and being prepared for the worst case scenario possiable and to not panic when i have cargo or customers on board that are relying on me to get them to there destinations and back safely and also enjoy sitting back in my flight seat and picking all sorts of air planes from a twin otter to a seven hundred and fortyseven and flying from a point of intrest maybe half way around the world to another place or airport that seems intresting if you are a serious flight simmer i would recommend this to all and the great add ons it has to offer plus the many other top notch flight sims out there so sit back and enjoy the thrill
early access reviewthis game is a extremely good game if you enjoy grinding even though it is in beta still it has good graphics and gives players a lot of fun when they do play
early access reviewi could easily write a 10page essay on all the issues bless currently has item duplication exploit that has been present and known ever since korean release terrible optimization as soon as there is more than five players on screen the fps goes down to 30s even or powerful top end systems game having a large emphasise on pvp having such low fps is unacceptable buggy quests bad translation and voice acting missing contentthese are the most game breaking issues there is many more issues but im so fed up with the game that i cant even be bothered ranting about them
early access reviewhonestly only played one game but its pretty damn fun and smooth a great free two play br game thats still in early access but install it and see if you like it
early access reviewi started playing this a few days ago as a new player i have observed that a lot of matches are onesided stompfests if you dont spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match a waste of time unless youre willing to drop cash to roll for epiclegendary items before ever setting foot in a match edit after putting more hours into the game i find the gameplay to be flawed every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind so long range weaponry is useless on most maps this compounds the problem with the game i mentioned earlier not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed but you need specifically shortranged ones it is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps
a proper magicclone with a good card economy the ability to play on pc phone and tablet really makes it great free initial campaign nets you several cards to get started with and there are multiple modes of play against ai and other players only drawback is 1v1 only but for a free game with several mechanics multiple expansions a fair ingame market paid options consistent connectivity and events cant complain too much
was fun learning the game but over all got boring fast for me most of the real time based games are limited early on by slots and or heros you can pay to unlock more slots for quests and crafting items but you can unlock them with gold at different levels i got to level ten before removing the game i am sure if you pay for slots you can progress much quicker but by that time you will be really bored anyways of this game i installed the game again and got into an active clan it seems there is much more to the game only thing that really bothers me is i find that when i send heroes onto quests armor with a thirty chance to breaks does so very often
when i frist started playing everquest two it was amazing its still great the players were friendly and mature there were lots of things to do still is but now days groups are tough to come by because of the population decline about a year ago update six hundred and twenty two thousand and eighteen population problems seem to have been evened out due to server merges the shadow oddesy was the prime of everquest two imo i suggest playing this many people have made life long friends and even gotten married irl because of this game i still have so many great memories from people i played this with but bridges have been burned and i cant relive them so i have to make new ones its so sad for me to see so many people i used to play with leave for other mmos and never return the best time of my gaming life was when i was playing my main at the time on the everfrost server merged with another server so it isnt call that anymore in a guild called stormsurge this is a game where you have to be respectul of other players because there arent millions of people loggin on every day like ff14 or eso you unknowingly begin making a name for yourself when you begin playing get this game maybe you can have great memories like i do everquest is an mmorpg unlike any other unriveled in its content update six hundred and twenty two thousand and eighteen i have been playing eq2 for ten years the only reason steam says i have less than three hundred hours is because it hasnt been on steam for the full duration of its release so if i had to guess id say i have around three thousands four thousands hours on everquest 2my main is called scuttlebutt and he is on the antonia bayle server hit me up if you want to play
three hundred and thirty hours on here but i think around 1k more on glyph progressively makes yourself wanna neck the more time you put in but once you get to what you think is the light at the end of the tunnel its pretty chill theres a quite a hefty lock that holds the p2w of the game and you can force through it but the game does a really good job of making it seem worth it which most of it isnt i dont really know whether to say i recommend or dont recommend it but i think for the miniscule size and f2p you have nothing to lose if you like it thats good if you dont dont force yourself because it will be a horrible time
maybe this just isnt my style of game but i didnt find it engaging enough after five minutes to want to continue im not keen on games in which everything is done for you just select what you want place it wait for resources repeat no challenge the waiting thing is a nono for me as a gamer there needs to be more engaging activities than pushing pixels around on a whim
steam claims twenty three hours but i have far exceeded that number before the game came to steam i love this game it gets very grindy at times but honestly i dont mind it its a nice game to just blow some stuff up the only con that i can see if it bothers you is the grind
this isnt really a review of the game as a whole but rather of its state right now this game used to be in a very bad place realm was neglected by its owner kabam which allowed hackers and exploiters to do whatever the hell they wanted with the game realm was very slowly dying and many well known players within the community were leaving and overall the whole experience of playing this game became a lot less fun luckily for us kabam has recently sold our beloved game to people who actually give a about it deca games in the past month or so deca games has done so much to improve the game and restore it back to its former glory right now is the best time youve ever had to start playing realm i recommend anyone to give this game a chance again if you already have in the past and if youre new you should one hundred give it a try
taking into account we already have better mmos like tera or wow i dont think you could witness something new in neverwinter i do not know anything about the dd lore so maybe you could give it a shot if you do but personally i think there are better games of the genre
great graphics great game get it so you can play with me i demand it simpley put you fly around your plane and shoot or bomb ground targets tons of planes to choose from p you lvl up and get better planes money isnt needed to play although im sure itd just give you the nicer stuff sooner im fine with waiting
well i was once like you a person with a life scrolling through steam until i saw this so called inncoent game i donwloaded itand begain to play now i cant stop and i refuse to leave my pc i highly reccomend it
i wish i could recommend i wish i could like this game i racked up over twentyfour hours of play time in four days of trying the game this game is hands down the most frustrating and tear provoking game that invokes levels of nerd rage i did not know possible why is that im glad you asked this game has the depth and pontential to be great however as it stands the mechanics are god awfully skewed in a way i did not forsee esl has less rng spam as hearthstone which should make it a better game right wrong the impact rng has on this game in a single play can decide an entire match based off one lucky rng roll the rng mechanics of this game impact very high value moves the rune system means if you get all five of your runes poped and no prophecy and your opponet pops two of his and both are prophecies you are done you will likely not over come two free often powerful card plays in the most critical of needs rng will fail you absolutely and unapologetically leaving you to go one thousand and fifteen game losing streaks intellect stragey tactics and brillant deck building means nothing in the end all that matters is luck the only silver lining is that the p2win fest that is hearthstone is less applicable as even a dekc of thirty legendaries can and will still get screwed by bad rng rolls one pro was the story mode it was fun and interesting however over all this game falls flat on its competitive play being decided for you you dont decide anything the draw decides everything i once went eight games in a row where i would get stuck with a nine cost legendary in my first draw or intial hand in some way i had seventy cards in that deck and yet one out of seventy chances out of eight games i got stuck with a useless card that caused me to lose vs opponents who always have the right cost cards for opening play there is nothing more infuriating then knowing you are losing to people not because of skill or tactics simply because the game decided it didnt want you to win that is not a fun game
without paying you basically have a tec demo or an extreme grindthis game could be great if it took a leaf out of the book on fishing planet and have us a daily play bonuc that ended on the fifth day with some premium curencythat coupled with maybe adds for the guest players when starting up would certainly be tolerable either give us an option to pay thirty fifty all in for infintie play offline without using the servers or multiplayer and have it run as a single player game maybe backing up save data to the steam cloud like many games dothen the subscriptions just add boosters or access to cosmetically better kit
simple enough that you can hop in join the fray and have loads of fun fighting not a hardocore flight sim no need to tweak throttles knobs swithces just jump in and go if you are looking for absolute one hundred realism then this is not the game for you if you are looking for one hundred fun you found it plus free makes any game fun i use a thrustmaster tflightstick without issues it even has it on the list of supported peripherals chek six
early access reviewno balance on pvp nerfed players damage to one third but no change on monsters hp whatever in dungeon or outside the game is so slow and you always stuck on your next main request because your level did not reach it then you have to use your low damage to kill high hp monster and level up fps is always under three hundred and two thousand and eighteen game
this class based shooter might seem cartoony and corny at first but once you start playing its a hell of lot of fun also theres tons of cool weapons and cosmetics to dress up with and try out i have always enjoyed playing this game
game has a solid base but it is totally pay two win which is fine i have paid real money on this game but end of the day it is only ever a temporary boost no matter how much money you give the game demands more tryist to progress is like trying to run on a treadmill that is in a pool full of jelly if you play for the fun of the game only it is great the moment you start to want to progress be prepared to pay cause after you hit a certain tier the maintenance cost of keeping your planes flying outweighs the rewards you get from playing so while there technically isny a limit on what you can get for free there really is it isnt even a time issue it is case of diminishing returns that screws you over tl dr short bursts good trying to compete bad it is not a money issue i have close on one thousands games in my steam account alone if i think a game is worth i have no problem spending money just this game you have to spend serious money constantly unless you are happy to use the lowest tiers
eng this is game rarely its just will be better if you wont play with this game parry passive dash cancer cancer cancer all the players always do it normal players they arent there everybody want to win therefore they play like s cancers s e t c the developers themselves spoiled this game ru редкостное лучше не играйте в эту ню возможно если в игре онлайн станет 2к то разрабы наконец поймут что делают ню но это не точно советую удалить эту ню и попробовать чтото другое сейчас она в худшем состояние чем дальше тем хуже игроки все больше учатся пидарству всем что сиги не должны быть такими разрыбы просто дауны делают сиги практически как лайт атаки5 из ten положительных эмоцийp s они решили что выйдя из бета теста это станет атой игрой пошли они к черту сукины ки
early access reviewhonestly this game feels like steep as br game xd i personally really like the snow setting and the class system is a really good idea that feels new and fresh the gunplay needs a little work balancing but so far id say its worth a play
in the army you had to disassemble your ak47 under thirty seconds with your eyes closed this game lets you do the same without the time limit and the fear of having to peel potatoes if you fail
very fun unique take on a rpg basically where games like diablo and torchlight have you level up skills through a skill tree and add stats through gemssocketables path of exile does the opposite you add stats through a huge stattree and add skills to your class through socketable items really cool great atmosphere and lots of replay potential did i mention its free
balance the game do not make it to historical how the hell do two usa m4a3e8 sherman easy eight shooting at one again at only one german panzer v ausf g at the same time what was the out come the two usa tanks get destroyed wtf the geramn tank took its time to select which target to distory first while being shot at multiple times this is my first review ever on steam this game was fun but now you just die of headshots all the time when i mean all the time you die headshot after continuous after consecutive headshots you may think ok maybe there is a hacker using aimbot but no how wrong are you to think that its the game everyone cannot be a hacker with aimbot no its the game you will die all the time with headshots everyone is a pro no scope headshot death dealer but you playing they need to update this issue the game play sucks when you die all the time with one shot headshot
early access reviewfor the most part i have had a desent experience with robocraft although it is considered a free game it is impossible to play without premium in order to recieve more items to allow you to compete with other players you must have premium i would consider this game pay to win
i have been playing this for many months on my smartphone i heard that it had been ported to steam and wanted to be able to play it using my steam account once i provided the correct information the devs linked my account inside of five minutes i was blown away at how fast and effeciant they were thank you guys for making a good casual game thank you for fast and responsive support well done

early access reviewive played this game for the past three or four builds the devs ruined it by making the grind unbearable i dont mind grinding i actually think that grinding makes some games bearable for example my character haas been at the same rank ever since i was ninety hours into the game another thing ive been losing money just for using a weapon the way it was designed to be used that is a problem
early access reviewi played this game a cople of weeks i loved this game when i reach rank five i had only ppd forty with one bullet upgrade when i start playing on airport map i understand that the enemy team have recon with the last sniper with full upgrades he kill me from very far distance i think this is a great game with great design but when you reach rank five you play on very big and incomprehensible maps and you will play against rank five six seven twenty with full upgrade weapons vehicles and planes retomoto please fix this cool game
after hours and hours of being spawncamped sniped and wallbanged by hackers i made a steady foothold on this game i was given some items by one of the less toxic members of the infestation community and i must say this is shaping out to be pretty good still too many ing hackers and snipers that spawn camp tf out of you110 mlg anticheat is not spicy enough
i love the game while i dont got many hours on pc i have played for what i think is over six hundred hours on console this game is amazing games now are dedicated to money and providing little content this game just ing blows my mind with the levels of intensity of these battles i would love to see this game be tooken by a big company and revived this game isnt shown the love that it used to install this game and dont stop playing it ing endless gameplay
early access reviewthis game is the worstbest game that i have ever playedpro free to play cs with cod featuresnot pay to win most items are cosmeticalgood way to grind time with friends cons awful hit regrisation weird bugs ex getting close to a player will launch you in the air or die gameplaydead multiplayer conclusion it is a mixture of cod and cs with awful gameplay and bugs a deformed baby of both parents

with seventy this is not to dota we loved anymore i have been playing since warcraft iii dota and really loved it dota two was enjoyable due to similarities of original dota the new update totally took that away from us seventy changed major things that differentiated dota2 from league of legends and heart of storm the game pace became so fast that it feels you are playing league of legends valve if i wanted to play league of legends i would have played league of legends not to mention the indecipherable ui what is this maybe i should go back to warcraft dota
early access reviewso far i have managed to accumulate fifty minuets in this game not playing mind you trying to log in this is no fault of the game developers im just an idiot and typed my email with cm instead of com when trying to register and didnt realise so all in all1010 like skryim two with game play
early access reviewbest battle royale game ive played so far finally a fresh take on the gamemode i like very much brings me sooooo much fun and its very well optimized no major bugs no annoying mechanics just simple and fun game and its free
early access reviewexceeded all my expectations there are a few small issues with the game not great optimisation tabbing out takes about fifteen seconds not great driving mechanics etc but its in early access and with seemingly good devs i believe this game could go far it takes a new spin on battle royale games which i personally love
i legitimately got scared for a few parts for such a simplistic game it has achieved more than your average aaa scare game will but graphics matter go shoots yourself or rather go play this game i have to say for a free game this thing delivers quite a lot i love the references i have found in the game so far and the easter eggs d the deeper you delve the more this becomes a master piece going from arcade to the common overly used failed experiment horror tags to some anime with major plot twists madoka to tortured souls to more references that i yet have to encounter dedit nominated for haunting my dreams
this is a very fun game you can play with your friends its coop its multiplayer its free to play action rpg indie massively multiplayer you should play this game its also free
early access reviewi cant even tell exactly i am hyped for this game after playing it out for a bit i experienced the amazing graphics the mechanics and overall fast paced combat the only thing i can ever state out as a negative trait is the size of the maps they are mainly made for very quick paced close quarters combat they are really small but have a lot of pathways inside them that kinda dissipates the small size of the maps i really hope developers continue with this system and do not create a p2w game in future currently even in this state it is a mindblowing and very addictive game i am actually considering to move to this game from cs govery toxic community with insane amount of bugs the mechanics are quite similar too you have accerelation based movement unlike in games like overwatch all of this i rate one thousand and ten
early access reviewthe game was better on day one compared to now theyve dumbed it down too much with their reduction in damage and increase in health they cant balance weapons for just look at the sword hirez lowers the skill gap patch by patch and the player countviewer countfun amount is also lowered patch by patch
small review from a newbiepretty alright game and ill get to my little review on it starting with the cons cons main issues the horrible optimization of the servers including how its pretty difficult to get through the early stages by playing freelysimply put its a game where theyll probably try to milk you for all you have unless you get very lucky with the rnga couple bugs here and there all being somewhat annoying but not the worst thing out there pros community pretty funny at times fun map to explore but it can be tedious to travel around so much not even being able to teleport back to your cornerstone this ones a con and a pro depends on how you like to playfreely building onin your cornerstone is a nice feature along with the items you can later get to upgrade the appearance of it lots of freedom to build whatever youd like in all honesty feel free to give it a try id recommend it
early access reviewbrawlhalla is a fine game it has a small handful of issues but most of them are pretty minor and not worth mentioning the only one that i feel like actually talking about is how similar the characters are one charatcer with a gun weapon feels almost identical to another character with a gun weapon however this issue isnt really to big anymore since theyve been adding more unique moves to each character if you want a good 2d brawler i would highly recommend this game
this game is very addictive i have been playing for more than two months and i love it it looks simple but very repetitive and it makes you want to win more and more how could anyone not like this game although its not a fps or so lots of people who are into a style of gameplay like this would love it check it out i dare you to get one thousand medallions in the first week
no matter how big the tank an aa gun will always beat you out you are a medium tank sneaking up on a t1 aa boy sure sucks to be you as soon as that aa realizes youre there and will he you only have a matter of seconds to shoot his truck and hope it doesnt richochet before he shoots through your twenty mm armor like its your grandmaws kidneys thinking of using an antitank guntank bah dont sweat it youll only richochet half the time thats only if an enemy tank with only a barrel sticking out doesnt tag you and bag you first
bad game you have to pay just to play the game and disassemble a gun or whatever you are disassemble i would not recommend it if there was more to it and maybe a range and stuff as well as not having to pay to play it then it would be a bit better
it would be by far the best moba in terms of playstyle and sutch thingsbut the servers are way to laggy there are way to much bugges around hirez refuses to fix and the skilldeskription often hides way to much detiles making it nearly impossible to take the game serious at a higher compettetive gameplay
early access reviewmy first review about this game was positive because i was mainly playing the single player mode after a few hours that was not enough anymore then i started to play team deathmatch and battle arena at td theres no reason to play serious even if you get top score if you die youll receive the same bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match after do some damage to an enemy only theres no teamwork because only the top score alive at the end of the match will receive the protonium box so is just a race for kills and points if by any chance you finish the match alive but you did no damage to an enemy youll not receive any box zero score zero box even on the winning team ba has usually better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast my main complain about this game is theres no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and five cubes as base just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design
early access reviewi tried giving it a shot i really enjoyed the ai games the forge and the gauntlet but then i spent about two hours trying ranked games and its just a game of who has legendaries and who doesntlegendaries are far too strong and prevalent in the sht ranks where new players go so its not even playable for someone with basic edit as an update even the single player mode isnt fun anymore when you get far enough youll start facing enemy decks loaded with stun stun is the most disgustingly unfun and uninteractive sht i have ever seen it takes the horrible freeze mechanic from hearthstone that literally everybody hates and multiplies it by two literally when someone casts stun on your minion from any of the various sources you cannot block with it that turn then you cant attack the following turn and you cant block the following turn after that with how quick games are decided stun is effectively killing a unit and yet its cheap or free in all cases because of stun i will no longer be playing this game
early access reviewthis game is constantly evolving some addition good some bad there are a lot of people who dont like it and i get it ive got three hundred and fifty hours in the game and when i ever have a large streak of kills i could understand the anger from my victims two years ago the game was not like this literaly everyone was at the same level so grinding was a piece of cake as time passed more and more people got better weapons and that was that then a surge of people joined and once they reached level five they were put into games with experience players such as i all with one shot rifles up to an insane range guilty as charged and it does not stop at the rifles even pistols can be upgraded to be a three shot kill at 50m also guilty as charged so anyone who says the game is pay to win is partialy right but it was not always that way i had my friends play with me and they were very angry at how the starting weapons are absolute garbage and that they were dying too easily the game has so much potential but it is really only fun for people who have played for long enough tldrthe game is at this point a pay to win still fun to play though
early access reviewone of the best fps shooters of all timeat first i was confused because i was referred to this game by my close friend when he tells me about the mechanics i was instant veteranthis game has good graphics and it has a similar feel to csgo and call of dutythis game is great if you have the graphic settings set to the high preset keep it up game developersps i host servers and i would like to host a server for this game because this game is the best
early access reviewdraw system is rigged as ten mana in a row for either player happens every game drawing same card three times in a row etc having to draw mana is ing trash in magic why would they not go the hearthstone route and make it fun to play instead of a rigged draw shuffle system small plus is you can grind on ai for cards unlike hs paying for cards is actually more expensive than hs and for a worse game that ripoffs magic theres no reason to play it and ai cheatsis dumb so yeah
tf2 used to be my favorite game but the july eighth update ruined everything for almost everyone and if they dont revert the changes or at least make casual games actually casual then ill cash out sell my four hundred worth of in game items and never look back valve needs to remember why team fortress two is different than counterstrike and overwatch and not having the ability to goof around in a truly relaxed environment destroys fun for ninety of the playerbase
early access reviewfrom hero to zero when the game came out it was really good but as now after all the bad patches they fued up whole gameits really sad but we cant do anything about it i had fun but everything has to end one day
early access reviewi feel like to make some comment for this game after bought twentyfive protonium crates and gained seven epic parts with no legendaries why should i spend my money on these protonium crates if no finer parts they give than rusted dont buy this game epic loot epic disappointment
a great freetoplay experience for anyone as lonley as me until you level up so much that the hawt animuwomen die before you get a chance to fap to them ʖ all though the game has no plot or context the apperance of the are more than enough of a selling point for me which is saying something since the game is free my nan also recomended it
absolutely terrible i tried playing this game about ten times in vr nine out of those it crashed the last try it started but the game would freeze every five seconds making it unplayable absolutely the worst racing experience i have ever had
early access reviewi liked it inspite of being in alpha modeits pretty gooda player like me coming from dota two and fps might have bit problems in understanding the mechanism but you guys will get used to it enjoy
was a good game at one point it is mostly now a cash grab by the moneyhungry devs if you want to play the game as a free to play it will take a very long time to unlock anything past tier two and three hundred and forty five are imposible to unlock in a reasonable amount of time withought dropping money into it now lets not forget the damage models of these planes if you so much as breath on the wings they will break off the control of the aircraft in arcade and realalistic are poor infuriating at times groundforrces are beond broken ships dont seem that badf but it feels to little and to late in my oppinion so if you are looking for a realalistic and well developed combat flight go to il2 if you wanna goof of and around for a couple hours and dont care much about progresion its probably for you
early access reviewif you play using dsr or vsr in 4k it doesnt look all that bad the game feels super call of dutyish with cs elements if youre somewhat decent at cod 4mw2 youre going to crush everyone in this gamecheck my screenshots the game is not p2w the microtransactions are all cosmetic right now there isnt much content i can see this game being somewhat fun to play for an hour its 300mb just go ahead and try it
even though this game is simple and decent fun its pretty dull and repetitive once you play it for a while there are microtransactions of some level which is pretty much inevitable in todays free to play titles at least its free and you can play it a fairly decent amount without investing any money in it
early access reviewthis game is just getting on your nerves ing modders invincibility when respawned and they can kill you this game is just ebola this game sucks so bad it cant even reach heaven if you download this you will waste the time of your life
this is a good game when you feel horny and really want it like seriously i broke up with my dog and it really upset me but i played this game and was gay again this is seriously my life now wishes to all horny dogs out there prnhb twenty sixteens
really good game especially for a minecraftstyle voxel exploration game ive seen complaints here about the game not loading a lack of public servers there are over two thousands i can join and ive had no problems but they seem to be either unfounded or due to very lowend pcs trying to run a game they cant handle as for the claims that a bunch of blueprints are behind a paywall first of all theres only a handful that seem to be premium or pro or whathaveyou second building blueprints arent necessary for building certain structures they just give you what amounts to an easymode building guide to replicate prefab structures the other pro benefits are just nice bonuses nothing necessary or even superuseful oh a flashlight but i can make torches by the dozen for almost no resources oh longer sprint times so what its an exploration game not an action mmo and its not like minecraft isnt guilty of putting all the good texture packs skins behind a paywall esp on consoles all in all i think this does what minecraft did but better id like to see more from this dev team honestly
early access reviewprobably the best battle royale game ive played910 will play againprosgame loads quicklymatches are want to jump into another gamefunperforms better than most battle royale gameship firing is quite easy to useconsclunky controlsmovement take some getting used toseems as if armor does nothingrecoil is high
early access reviewi play this game for two hours and just i can say thats a realy cool gamehave lot of fun on thatthe is good but it needs more and betteri hope that the future game is good
early access reviewi played this game for a very long time i started at the rise of the walkers and it looks like im stopping now playing this game the epic loot update is more than just its the ultimate downfall you have no chance to get what you want with the random crates and you get just a quarter of the robits as you would pay no dont play this game thirty four years ago i would have highly recommended this game but not anymore im done with you freejam
early access reviewthis game is exactly what a free to play ccg should beno intentionaly slow grind no level grinding multiple gamemodesand most importantly you get to keep any card you acquire in the game
fallout shelter is a good fun little game where you manage the development of a fallout shelter the cartoonstyle drawings are nicely done the general structure of this game seems to have been well thought out you acquire resources to expand the size of your base recruit people and send out some hardy adventurers on quests the requirements for food water and power seem to be balanced the emergency incidents that occur have not seemed to be out of proportion to the resources at hand so far at least fallout shelter is essentially a management game however in some ways it is almost like a clicker game albeit quite an advanced one you have to keep on going back and forth between production units to keep the resources flowing and there are long waits for the completion of quests and the production of some resources and skill levels to encourage players to get impatient and purchase upgrades microtransactions sending vaultdwellers out on quests can take a long time unless you use your bottles of nukacola quantum which speeds up the journeying but such bottles are few and far between unless you feel like spending some reallife money on buying some more yes theres the catch your questers engage in battles versus enemies in various buildings but its action of just a very basic nature no first person shooting happens in the game the fate of those people who go out into the wasteland to explore is relayed to you via lines of text you dont actually see them in action unless they go into a quest building which you have to authorise mostly the game is about managing the resources of your base or vault i quite like fallout shelter from my point of view the pros far outweigh the cons be warned that you will need a goodly store of patience to play this game which brings to mind the old prayer god grant me patience but hurry up about it so if you arent a patient person you might want to let this one pass by but if patience is one of your virtues then this might just be the game for you if youre a patient person who enjoys a bit of postapocalyptic fun then i recommend that you give this game a tryp s people should be aware that there is a major problem with this game although it is easily overcome if your game crashes or your computer crashes then you can lose your entire game apparently its something to do with it then not synchronising with the steam cloud this drama has happened to many people whereby they have lost all of their many hours of game progress you need to back up your game the location for saved game files is in the secondlast section backing up your saved game files for fallout shelter in this guide http steamcommunity id904883576
this game is trash and meant for only the ultimate degenerates in this world dont play this takes mad long to do stuff and the tutorial seems like it was made in a mcdonalds bathroomso yeah dont get this
i did like this game unfortunately although it supports linux when i try to launch it it instantly crashes well there goes about ten hours of downloading and there doesnt seem to be any fix for that nor do the devs seem to care why dont you simply test your game before releasing a patch devs ps on all the platforms you claim to support
early access reviewabsolute garbage loved aq and df and even dfw but this this is just garbage the ui is a joke the controls are a joke the audio is just horrendous the quests are uninspiring the enemies are stupid and just trade cooldowns the inputs take seconds to register its not a game its just a bad joke this cant have been released by the devs of the flash mmos we loved in our teens010 absolutely save your 50mb on your ssd this isnt worth your time
overviewim sorry thehunter i played this game after playing the amazing thehunter primal and the second i loaded up the game i was dissappointed the ui looks crappy and movement seems to be much much slower if you think im comparing it too much to primal then look at it this way movement is fairly slow in primal so in this one it feels like you are tiptoeing through the grass even when you are running its also harmed by quite possibly the worst free two play business model i have ever seen i just couldnt bring myself to play much of this game however i will say that when creating a profile with thehunter it is quite nice to pick an avatar for your character positive character character movement crappy looking ui hunting licenses business modelconclusioni feel quite sad for having had to leave this review quite simply because i love thehunter primal so much it makes me feel grateful that it turned out so good even in early access you should definitley not download this game it hardly even counts as f2p
early access reviewi first played this many months ago and decided to give it a try tonight only to find they have added easyanticheat as a requirement while i get that client side anticheat software can be useful and seems to have been needed based on forum posts i have considerable privacy concerns based on what eac is requesting it be allowed to do on my computer the software itself has full access to screenshot keylog and google searches have shown the results are publicly available for all to see the only limiting factor is their word that it only operates while the game is running while im sure there is other anticheat software running on my computer ie steam the data it returns to any third party servers has never been google searchable i recommend the developers for robocraft force a migration of their users to steam and use steams built in anticheat instead of using a third party app developer who obviously has zero clue on how to secure data being returned to their servers theres no excuse for that to be google searchable
the graphics are decent and the character customization is good there is a chat channel where you can ask other players for helpinfo and there is a good amount of helpful people that said this game is missing so much it has paid currency gems referred to as lacrima and thats fine a lot of games have them what is ridiculous is that they are not account wide if you are a new character you cannot move them between characters you cannot move items that would be account bound on any other game between your characters so if you get something that is not tradeable on your first character and then decide you do not want to play that class you are stuck with all the bonus or gem bought stuff as well as the gems themselves on that character there is a tab for lacrima transfer but that isnt even available until level fifteen the skill tree is all kinds of confusing and there arent any explanations in game to help with it for example one of my characters was an assassin and most of her skills had a when done from stealth bit in the description but no where on either chain or non chain skill tree did it say stealth nor is there a hot key for it the games version of stealth for that character is called incognito which you cant get till thirteen and it doesnt even say you enter stealth granted with most games there is a bit of figure it out for yourself type stuff but damn this was ridiculous i spent the first two days playing the assassin confused as hell then there is the gathering system you need special items for gathering as is the usual for a lot of games but the items in this game are applied as a buff for one hour which means you cant just gather as you go you have to use one of your consumable charges and go out and just gather for that hour and everything you gather goes into your inventory which isnt that many slots not getting a lot of slots is pretty standard too but upgrading it is crazy expensive in this game most of the features are not available right away only after youve gained a certain amount of levels you cant even click on several of the features on the main menu to get an idea of what something does targeting is weird sprinting is weird getting your flying mount into the air is weird i can get used to a lot of drawbacks in a game but i think this is the first game ever that i just cant get over the sheer amount that it has its a newer game so maybe they will change some stuff as it is i wont bother playing this one again
lets start with a pros and cons list of the game from someone who is not super big on free2plays but chose to give this one a shot because it looked decent prosthe devs are constantly working on the game to make improvements and bug fixesmultiple game modes to appeal to a wider audience than just a handfuloption between first person and third person point of viewsamazing moneypoint system where you gather money as you kill zombies and players and can use that money in the marketplace to buy things like extra ammo gear vehicles etc and its all stuff you can buy without paying real top dollar although they do have a real money form of currency for skins and to make your stuff look nifty but i mean come on its a f2p they need to make money someway and honestly id say this is not a p2w game due to the fact the bulk of what you buy is just bs skins like a knock off csgo thingtalent tree is fun so as you gather exp from killing you can spend it to make you not lose health as fast hit harder less recoil etcgameplay is immensly impressive not choppy laggy at least not on the na servers if youre in the middle of killing someone and they try to auto disconnect to save their and so you dont get points it doesnt work theres a ten second disconnect timer for when scumbags try to pull stuff like thatyou can log off whenever wherever you want you do not respawn in the same place regardless of if you connected to the same serverswould love to see more maps but hey its already an amazing f2p and even with just the few maps they have i never find them repetitive or boring because its all about surviving and while playing youre always so into just doing that that whatever map is chosen doesnt even matter while youre running for your life from a horde of zombies or a player whom you thought was friendly and is now chasing you down the street in nothing but a motorcycle helmet while wielding a machete so many pros but id like to go have a smoke break so onto the consthis game is basically just a compton simulator or a canada simulator i dont know both places suck run down buildings and tweakers or zombies roaming the streets sucks you have to pay real mulah to get cool skins on your guns but aye just like cssemicancerous community but theres always those few really cool guys to group up and run withwhen you die you drop all your stuff which sucks but aye thats part of the game get over it or get off much love to the devs for being ontop of their stuff with bug fixes and updates you guys are amazing and this is one hell of a game for a f2p smoke break timestinky pete
early access reviewmaybe this game is not quite comprehensible and newbiefriendly but it looks promising there is still no balance and everything feels based only on a players expertise and ability to team up for the victory for the fans of space combat games this is a definite must try
sorry to say that but this a pretty braindead game if i really want to have me and my pc idling around i could simple engage the screensaver and look at the astonishing graphics instead of playing this and yes you need some more a lot more idle time should you really want to kill that first boss
thehunter is thepaytohavefun game as much as i would like to recommend a hunting game that is this open and supports multiplayer it takes way too much time and effort to be able to do anything but hunt mule deer when you first start out you can only hunt mule deer and rabbits the trick is that you dont have a gun to hunt rabbits with instead you have to earn currency by hunting mule deer in a couple different challenges and competitions which dont give you enough currency to do much at all even if you do paytohavefun its for a limited time that you can access all the animal license and a limited time to acess all the hunting grounds the only thing you get to keep is the items and guns and you have to keep hunting to get more currency to keep buying ammo for the guns you want to keep using except for the starting gun
alright its and idle game and thats that having autoclicker i assume makes the game go faster but doesnt really defeat the purpose since theres basically unlimited content lets do it the normal way minuses and plussess unbalanced factions like literally angels beat every faction end game while elves destroy the mid game and farm coins like a goddamn twitch streamer being good angels fairies or elves does require pressing lots of buttons atleast the game tells you that youre forced to go angels if you want to get good unless you dont want to spend your life on this not deticating life to this review either s theres unlimited content how many coinsgems will you be able to get and how many upgrades youll get if you choose to be evil the games mostly afk you still have to press a button every once in a while and clicking buttons constantly will get you up there faster really chill and hooking like it should be you can grind for achievements ingame its hard multiple factions to choose from which focus on different things such as goblins are fairly unique f2pnow i wish this game some kind of train troops and fight mechanic would make it a little more entertaining from what it already is but its fine as it is i like it you should try it too if you want a clicker fantasy idle game or something like that
this is a wonderful game its one my favorite flight sim in the world that being said i wish we could control the infantry and move around there and not be limited to the vehicles thats all i have get this game
not free to play not even a pay to win game its subsciption isnt bank breaking but you also have to pay for everything else and there is a lot you need to buy to play it i admit it is a good game but not good enough for what it asks for id love to play it if it were free to play or even a one time payment of between five hundred and ten gbp because thats the quality of the the game but the money making scheme behind it turned me off it gonna pay â fifteen for stomping land and try that instead dinosaurssomeone let me know when they bring out an arma three mod of this game
my roommate saw me playing this and described it as minecraft for adults my best friend is a mc pro imo and he is loving this game i have never played mc but ive seen it and just couldnt get past the graphics this game however is easy on the eyes ive seen a lot of paywall complaints yes there are some recipes behind the pw it is not over half as described by others there are plenty of recipes and options to get creative playing for free the only major con i would mention is that your wearable gear degrades very fast and youll have to replace weapons and armor rather frequently when it breaks this is more painful at the start as once your set up well you can farm up what you need for the best wa recipes and just replace as needed the minor con i would mention is that the lighting items are not equal in the amount of light given off the gas lamp item seems to give off the most light from any light source item everything else pales in comparission which can compromise your creativity in your build i generally only use the gas lamps because of this the difference in comparrision is huge and you will notice farming materials can get a bit grindy at times but a little creates a lot so really it just depends on how big your vision is and what your making if your not awesome at planning a build they have blueprints you can unlock which will hold your hand through a build i havent tried a blueprint yet but i like this idea they ran a bonus coins if you go pro event just prior to my two friends and myself finding and trying this game if they run it again we will all be upgrading to pro if you like contests devs seem to run them semifrequently and the prize is generally free pro upgrade and bonus coins to unlock recipes i never thought i would get into such an open ended game with no real goal that being said i find this game to be very addictive i am having a blastthanks for making this game my first pure builder type game experience has been very positive because of creativerse keep up the good work and please run more pro upgraderecipe bonusdiscounts d
this game got me to buy a wheel its very funny reading all the noobs put hurt on this game becuase its to hard if u love racing and hill climb get this game ps the free game is great u dont even have to spend dosh lots of free content
early access reviewscroll past the edits for the actual reviewimportant note played approx thirteen hours currently at lv16 and have the basic guardian package onetime payment not required update one almost level twenty current max level i will extend or rewrite this review when they release the full game sometime this year two thousand and eighteen looking at the game plan im five thousand and fifty on some of the features like dragon crystals from watching ads aq3d website aq3d gameplan which is a hard pass but ill grit my teeth if limited only to mobile and tablet so no pcthe edits edit one missed spelling and grammar corrections credit to grammarly also what i used before posting if i get names or anything wrong please forgive me edit two made the 0s in dragon lord5151s space between dragon and lord name the actual numbers requested edit three removed a space should be last edit sorryoverview the game itself is a grind not so much like maplestory 2d free to play sidescroller but you do notice it most of the game as far as i can see for now can be played without spending a penny gear can be bought with gold or grinded for some gear can only be grinded for and cannot be bought with gold or dragon coins real money when crafting gear you can either wait the allotted time or speed it up with dragon coins similar to crafting systems in games like warframe however this is never needed and if you have the patience can by waiting doing other things like grinding levels resources etc story the story is minimal and kinda lacklustre but it is there there is no voice acting but the music isnt half bad it doesnt really pick up until after doomwood which is the dragonslayer questline in ashfall it may be because i am a higher level or that its faster paced or a combination of it all but thats how it feels for me right now optimisation i run on a crappy laptop and for the most part the game is easy running which is always a plus for me its no eye candy thank the heavens but it isnt half bad i was born in the 90s though side notes there is no minimap or world map in the game the abilities are really simple others suggesting a skill tree even a simple one would do most paid items are cosmetic it seems but alternative potions to the gold bought varients are paid including some paid only potions like xp and faster gold potions also yes i have bought roughly two so far why because xp is so minimal in this game i know the cap is twenty with one hundred being the max allegedly but please make it a little more than what it is although cant really complain as i dont mind in the grand scheme of things notes on story apart from it needing a hell of a lot more content and features the story needing additions like voice acting choices and cinematic cutscenes maybe final say there is a whole lot more i could say but check discussions as lots of people have talked about and suggested much more than what i have here credit to all the ones i read and to dragon lord5151 if you can put up with the minimal gameplay and story which for now i hope is only due to early access then i recommend this game or wait for full release also please only have microtransactions cosmetic only because the day that this becomes p2w paytowin i will quit this game regardless of my time invested credit and extra take care everyone and i hope this helped again credit to everyone in the game who has mentioned stuff people in the discussions thread on steam and dragonlord5151
early access reviewokay okay let me just get this right they take away the level up system where everyone has a fair opertunity to grow themself and level up to get stronger and better they take away the gc and rc and replace it with crap now a brand new player can win a seeker or high level weapon and wreck everyone wats the fun in that go back to the old system and keep it that way why break something thats working so if you want to get this game make sure your ready to be dissapointed
early access reviewthis game used to be a lot of fun came back after being gone for a while and i miss what this game used to be i wish they had a classic mode for the older content and robots bought through the store new people to this game may find it enjoyable but i think im done with this game if i cant play the way i used to this review obviously is my opinion and it wont apply to everyone but man i just wanted to play the old content
early access reviewi ventured into the depths of this fun little mystery after quite a large amount of spooks i came across a messed up picture of kyubey from madoka magica one thousand and ten
pros good port from mobilestable fpsdont have to worry about batteryeasier to manage decks and cardsmore displays more infocons using the mouse is awkward especially when dragging a card to attackresolution is pretty bad and there isnt an option for full screenwould reccomend for returning players and new players
i have been playing this game for over a year and i have to say that before i knew about dota two i never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain ive ever felt really everything about this game is toxic and sucks the community is horrible as and so is the matchmaking people picking support heroes actually arent able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team what they are actually meant to do they go for their ing items first and dont even think about upgrading the courier after minute three yeah and its unnecessary to mention that they sometimes dont buy this courier at all so i am asking myself who in the hell into their head for them to do such stupid things it all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around and when there are already four carries why the do you the last one for picking go for a carry hero too that makes no sense while playing dota two i discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me normally im a calm and relaxed person but dota two forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realized that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the too when the game doesnt go well because my team mates are s again thats why i prefer to play with friends instead of going alone if its your lucky day you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not then let me say this rip there is no more to say really you will get this cancer gang and the game will be ed up furthermore you will waste more or less forty minutes of your precious time but trust me it will take longer way longer trust me and because you are a masochist like me you wont quit this game although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting dota two no instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches you will get mad as hell learn russian and persian for free and this will be a vicious circle you cant get out of it you are trapped in this game its really sad ive tried so hard but always end up playing when i have some time so here are my advices one never play alone when you have just started this game and dont have enough experience yet2 always have some foods and drinks preferably alcoholic next to you because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win or maybe for more flaming3 schedule your free time its not only forty minutes you will spend on this game actually it will be more than this sometimes the whole day is ruined by dota two once you start playing you cant stop anymore4 you have to be thickskinned or having nerves of steel there is no other way to endure this community you get it great then i wish you guys lots of joy playing dota two three
this game is a cash grab if i had spent money on this game the mole rat invasion would still have killed all my dwellers this game is alright but i would not recommend spending money on a game that will randomly introduce a disaster and wipe out everything you spent the money on
early access reviewvery magic the gathering in play style the freetoplay campaign is very short and afterward you are left with various gauntlet puzzle and other dueling opportunities not my cup of tea just because i prefer dynamic deckbuilders a la star realms rather than ccgs where you need to dwell and ponder over constructing the best deck all that said the game graphics and play is all very well made
""
nice uninstall simulator never seen such good simulator in the first seconds the game automaticly make you very angry in the next minutes it let you rage so much so you do uninstall the geme in your rage trip automaticly ah and something more for only some euros you could play the game right because without you cant play the game just because you cant shoot animals the without the licenses nice job expensive worlds
my only problem with this game is the zoom i had the same problem with hotline miami if theres anything that makes me sick its not having a proper camera view several hundred hours later okay so the game is really massive in depth i think theres a story somewhere too it adds new content fairly often it feels good theres a good sense of progression loot matters its super massively enormously huge in depth theres thousands of different builds you can do pretty much something for every taste did i tell you it has some insane depth my biggest issue is server stability its super goddamn laggy when youre clearing really fast its not ping its not internet its how the game works i guess they could change it but i wouldnt know how i just know it feels like absolute stuttering and freezing even when youre one hundred fps and 23ms ping to the server youre on anyone whos actually played fast before will also say thisinstances crash rarely but still way too often when a new league comes out theres quite a few big game crashing bugs that take too long to fix the community is toxic vile garbage always some idiot that thinks hes right even though youve got thousands of forum posts proving him wrong trolls trying to trick newbies into ing up their character completely or making them ruin an item or trick them into selling something worth tons for next to nothing ggg does nothing to prevent scams they basically endorse it you cant warn people about a known scammer youll get muted admins can be extremely obnoxious muting left and right for no apparent reason the game is still good despite all these issues you just really have to keep the social interaction down to a minimum at this point i cant really recommend the game maybe in next league theyll have sorted out some issues its just getting too old going through the same issues every time i play
early access reviewi have two hundred and thirtysix hours in this game i loved it untill last patch coming up they nerf smg which is my favorite weapon they nerf railgun my second fav delete megabot well this is the bigget nerf so much efford to build this monster but they are nerf weapons and remove megabots and this new fckin salvage shtepic loot i hate it i lost all of my game money now i cant buy anythingfckin shotgun weapons ruin the game killing you in three shots they ruin this game so badly yeah hackers are gone but normal players gone too big thx to developers now im gonna play crossout its better from this â â â â
product received for freeearly access reviewin order to play this game you must already own it and have the game for a year because as soo as you play people in low ranks battles will have guns from high rank so as soon as you start playing you will get drones with missle launchers obliterating anyone ever since they removed the ladder to get stuff the game has been bad i highly disagree with anyone getting the game
smite is a game with some nice character design and a unique perspective for a moba and literally no other redeeming qualities everything bad will be bad forever their sense of balance is a trainwreck centered around conquest the basic moba mode equivalent to summoners rift in league of legends with zero regard for the two concievablyfun modes or any others though plenty of characters are unabashedly overpowered or horrible on conquest as well again this will never change unless its for the worse there is a continuous attempt to convince players to spend money on the game with many of the cosmetics vanishing forever often the ones requiring a massive toll of both time and money many more skins can only be obtained through chests rather than bought directly to extort more money from gambling addicts hirez should definitely hire an actual programmer at some point every single patch is a storm of broken ui functionality disconnects from the server and outright crashing hirez hates fun they firmly segregate character classes with magical and physical being the main division and barring the one passive item no one of these types is allowed to deal the other type they also acknowledge if anything at all from the community the absolute worst suggestions made by the worst people which brings me to my next point the community is despicable you havent known hatred until youve experienced a nox main on arena it may seem childish to wish someone actual reallife harm over a video game but if any force on earth can cause that to happen its smite and arena is an actually fun mode despite having minions be too valuable conquest players hate you for not playing exactly how they want and also hate you because they are terrible about the game they are yelling at you over they only know one thing and that is that they hate you personally and wish you the worst life has to offer including being trapped in a game with them surrender is theoretically possible at ten minutes not early enough but better than leagues twenty but almost never passes the matchmaking is analogous to a war crime it appears to take the average elos of two handfuls of people which means that despite the asymmetrical reasoning this creates you specifically get a team of people far below your skill level and must defeat a team only slightly below your skill level which means you 1v5 against fed players of course the company may have committed actual crimes because employee reviews have painted its ceo to be a despicable arrogant one representative manchild who insists that balance is whatever he does well with play smite if you want to poison your soul so deeply that you feel contempt and betrayal even looking at a moba or a book on religion otherwise try literally any other game but still not league as it may actually be worse
early access reviewits much better now than the first two days devs are fixing things fast and listening to the community dont get influenced by all those youtubers this game has potential
early access reviewthe perfect game for getting shot in the back constantly spawning in the same place and getting shot in the back again then spawning in a house and getting sniped through the wall then dying to a random airstrike theres no matchmaking system whatsoever so you in your first match you will get matched with the freaks who dedicate their lives to this game utter garbage really
early access review5v5 space combat at its best interesting team combat but what i find most impressive about this game is the large divercity of ships with distinct playstyles moreover the ballancing is very well done so there are no ships which are simply better than other ships ive put a lot of hours into this game and have had a ton of fun still in alpha now but worth it
early access reviewthis game is a free to play knock off csgo the guns are the same as csgo and you even purchase them the same way too if you know how to play cs then you know how to play this there is even a knockoff dust2 and aim map its almost hilarious how this game even exists seriously do yourself a favor and just play cs it was kinda funny to play a really bad csgo actually it was hilarious but i dont think youll ever play this game more than twice with that being said i cannot recommend this unless you need something to play until you can earn fifteen to buy csgo
play as cloacker goes to biolab then afk back on keyboard ppl are already swarming the place place a claymore not long after one kill rearming and do the same10 kill in a couple of minutes and not even one from my handgun
if you love building and crafting you should definitely give this game a try i love the community aspect and the adventures that you can explore andor build are lovely you can have a world all to yourself or share it with others you can create blueprints of your builds to share with others it never ceases to amaze me how ingeniously people use the blocks to create incredible builds the seasonal events are fun too and best of all the devs are still working on the game so new stuff is coming out several times a year all in all a lovely game to express your creativity
wowi wonder what cool games are free is there any wowwhat is this brawlhalla wowit looks unique i will probably deinstall the game right after a match or two four hours later bwahahahahalets spend money on best game on the world yesyes mamooth coins all hail the best game
access reviewi like the landscape very much looks amazing graphics are superb eyecandy what an ingame atmospherefirst person game mode is for me a wannahave and is more realistic well done so far very good created keep it going
used to like the game still play it a lot but only cause i dedicated a lot of money do not recommend anymore play something else hirez has become more money hungry then dedicated at making sure the game is playable most likely new players will get stomped by max leveled masters players so good luck
superb game engine but spoilt by the fact that the dlcs are viciously expensive you cant even fire a gun in the free p51 which defeats the object of it being a training platform if the planes were cheaper or maybe in bundles that you could save a bit on then it would beat il2 hands down and i think more people would use it as their go to sim i love playing it for the feel and immersion of a fully interactive cockpit but i am not going to pay these sort of prices for a dlc unfortunately this seems to be the way on steam nowadays cheap or free games with extortionate dlcs to bring them up to what they should have been in the first place
as the first fallout game that i played it soon pulled me into the world of the other fallout games i quite enjoyed building my vault placing rooms however i saw fit eventually the game gets boring not being able to get more than two hundred dwellers but most of the time its great
early access reviewone of the best card games ive ever played its fast dynamic and still very deep very balanced allowing many diferent play styles the interface is quite simple allowing anyone to aproach the game from seasoned card grinders from other games to the new player who is looking for something new and fresh would recommend to anyone
i really like this game but after having to reinstall the game again i woke up to find my five hr save gone simply gone so of if this is a bug fix it until then nobody play this
early access reviewfooking garbage they count loading screen as play time so i cant refund this game neowiz disassociate themselves from refund cuz they couldnt manage a game launch now that they ripped off the players of their fifty three on launch for the normal version they intend to go free to play and still not refund those who never liked or been able to actually decently play the game cuz of their garbage management no joke i spent six hours on launch just to reach the character selection screen and once i did i got disconnected and i had to wait for hours again little did i know that those hours of waiting were calculated toward my playtime i mean srsly neowiz r u that desperate to get money as to fck up every person that dared buy ur trash game and count loading screen for playtime
yknow ive always enjoyed bloons since the first game while this doesnt exactly play like the previous instalments in the series its absolutely a welcome change to me basically rather than a hoard of bloons that are set by the computer you play against others attacking with your own bloons while trying to defend for anyone thats played clash royale its sooorta like that except this came first ill also bring up how in singleplayer bloons games you have access to every tower youve unlocked but in battles the battle lasts an hour at most so you can only use three of your unlocked towers and one more random tower this can bring up some interesting combinations letting you experiment on which one works best many of you may know that theres a mobile version for this game while you probably cant take this version around with you depending on what kind of computer you have this versions framerate is much better than the mobile version and due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics you can place towers in more precise locations in the end i dont really have many problems with this game its a solid multiplayer tower defense however certain functions are blocked by a paywall so look out for that
im rick harrison and this is my pawn shop i work here with my old man and my son big hoss everything in here has a story and a price one thing ive learned after twentyone years you never know what is gonna come through that door
i started playing recently poe about ten days ago its really addictive and fun im not the best rpg player out there so it took me a while to understand the mecanics people were willing to help me out and explain some things i didnt understand community is greatcompletely free to play the only thing that the game gets money from is cosmetics
this game is probably one of the most unique side scroller games i have ever played in my life it combines 2d combat with 3d graphics not to mention the friendly community depending if you participate in dungeons or arenas with the wrong people in my own experience ive only met few salty people but nevertheless the people are nice and are willing to help you if youre new i personally reccomend this game because not only does is the game itself exotic and different compared to other side scrollers this game is just awesome in many ways and will be the best game for you if you love anime
"ok this is my honest review its not a bad game its not my favorite game but i had playing the game here and there i sucki suck alot the vet thing provides a lare avdange when i got back but this didnt stop me from reconizing some magor problems most games are land slides which means you straight up win or you horrible lose every so often you have a close game its very rare such as finding a speck in the sand type of rare my first game had five fighterbombers on the enemy team if you so much had stepped outside you die if not by planes it was by tanks all i have are two mines and four nades if i go anywhere near a tank it kills me crew spots me moves is being protected or drives while i am chasing it to but that at mine down infront of it i rarly find any rpgs or panzerfaust i have very few momments of pure happyness in this game finally catch a tank mg42 support kill ten peaple i had stole a mg bike while playing russians mining the entire house waited for a while enemy tried to cap and i blew them sky high those momment where all in bad games the main problem for me is credits money is scarce equiment cost a little too much twenty nine thousand, five hundred for a wrench while i have a soviet vehicle which i constaly crash well it would be a good buy if only i got it on my american tank crew man too also the cost to turn them into a tanker is costly one hundred and fourteen thousand that must be one hell of a tank i am getting if i am paying that much also boculars which could be useful are twenty five thousand rpg cost around one hundred and sixty five thousand which suck even more vet provides a advatage that kills off most free to plays like myself they get one more equiemet slot and one more skill slot this kinda sucks for me so if you dont mind fix your mm fix your prices but hey its just me i guess have a lovely day i not going to say i hate the game but they do still need to fix it"
very mixed feelings about this game i still play it a lot and it can still be fun to play casually but if you ever decide to go into ranked and try to improve there are some glaring problems in the games mechanics that cannot go unnoticed this game is not like smash in fact blue mammoth games tries as hard as possible to be different from smash so the mechanics are different and in a lot of ways simpler however this does not mean the game does not take skill in fact i believe that brawlhalla actually has a pretty decent skill ceiling however becoming better at the game isnt always fun especially when youre nearing the top you will soon realize that the punish game in brawlhalla is ten times harder than smash and some legendsweapons in the game are downright annoying brawlhalla also utilizes a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block and instead of grabbing brawlhalla requires you to read the opponent and although there are reading patterns people tend to follow and moves that you can use to cover multiple dodge directions the enemy still has nine ways to dodge and eleven ways to react i dont know why but i havent exactly been able to bring myself to quit the game yet i would always rage from ranked but come back some other day and i think it has to do with how accessible the game is you can load up brawlhalla and be in a ranked match playing a 1v1 in under a minute no joke making it a great game to play when you are short on time tldr very fun casual gameplay aids ranked the higher you go flawed mechanics decent skill ceiling compared to smash although annoying to improve at highly accessible when short on time also the lag holy â â â â
i used to love dota two however seven hundred patch playtime has diminished from thirty five hours every day to twelve games max and its dwindeling further dont get me started on monkey king valve let the game down with this patch horrendus ui broken monkey king tons of changes nobody asked for
early access reviewreally enjoying this so far nerf to damage for balancing purposes was mostly a good thing as certain content seemed way too easy combat really feels like it has weight to it and i find it fun ive found the story quests to be enjoyable and ive not found the world to be lacking in content there is plenty of stuff to do for some reason ive also found the quests that are there to be more enjoyable than most other games again i think the feel of the combat helps with that
early access reviewa game that excels in building up suspense and laying it on thick with the jump scares when needed even if it is all randomeven in its unfinished form i can see this will be an indie hit i have attached a short play session below so you can check out what it is likehttps youtu begfwojtgugnu
this review is of course for the pc version of bethesdas behaviour interactives fallout shelter it originated as a mobile app which from its initial launch in june twenty fifteens i enjoyed on my phone very much up to a point i remember being so excited to hear this announced at e3 the pc version works identically which means some pros and cons in the transition from mobile to pc the way games are designed on one platform or another can reflect the nature of the platform and intended use of or vision for said games fallout shelter is one of those that just works better as a mobile app ultimately it comes down to time gated activities and rewards its tough to sit down and play this for prolonged periods of time as a dedicated pc game on my phone it feels totally natural to fire it up hit all my resources queue missions and all that then close the game to check it later now theres potential here for additions or improvements that bring the game more firmly into the pc space im sure anyone whos tried it could brainstorm up a few ideas my own run towards a more fleshed out questing system and deeper rpg elements id also request a combat speed setting of some sort on pc so i dont have to sit through the plodding drawn out fights during a mission a little too slow as is i dont enjoy how certain events seem to be scripted the specific example in mind is that some type of incident triggers shortly after game startup each new day in game or real time not sure early on these crises are simple manageable but they increase in magnitude as your vault grows presumably a bigger vault has more personnel with better weaponry to repel invaders put out fires etcetera at some point though its just a deathclaw raid each time so tiresome since deathclaws take a little while to kill and really burn through stimpacks keeping vault dwellers standing that lengthy costly routine is the last thing i want to greet me every time i go to check on my vault it quickly becomes off putting its gratifying to see ongoing support for the game including balancing along with all new content quests items etc bravo theyve also embraced the trend of seasonal events and miniholidays although that seems mostly relegated to cash shop discounts the cash shop offers various perks and upgraded versions of regular things that cant be obtained otherwise one noteworthy bug to warn you of on rare occasion should the game crash you may lose your save even if the files are still there regular manual backup of save files is the only sure way ive found to protect against this im giving a positive review since this replicates the fun of the mobile version just bear in mind it cant necessarily be played for hours on end like a conventional videogame that should be apparent from the outset tip frequently back up save files tip the help section is useful in that it explains some mechanics info you couldnt learn by any other means
early access reviewwhen you cant afford cs go etc just get this dedit btw i started playing this game in twenty seventeens when my friend told me about it when i was a f2p we just started playing but now we dont even see each other anymore so playing this game will never make me forget him
early access reviewone of the best games out there right now similar to magic the gathering in a lot of ways but much more accessible and usable online tutorial isnt great but once youre over that hump its fast to get into the game and build some cool decks
early access reviewwarmode is an arcadey shooter similar to the call of duty or battlefield franchise it features a selection of game modes maps and weapons the player base is decent if mostly russian due to the developers being russian and the game as a whole is built in unity what warmode brings to the table is pure simplicity it has low requirements under 1gb for space and its ninety nine free only thing you can buy here are some masks but theyre only cosmetic and are a way of supporting the developers the game however is full of bugs broken mechanics and hackers it isnt a very good substitute for any of the paid competitive shooters checking it out costs nothing but it has nothing to offer either
i played this game for hours before it launched on steam so i feel i can give an honest opinion hearthstone players play intelligence in this game it has all your rng cards that you love pno seriously you just stumbled across a no longer hidden gem in the competitive card game market elder scrolls legends is by far the best one out there easy to pick up meta is diverse the in game rewards sytem is very generous remember the arena in hs its here but theres also the solo arena you play against the ai the story is good too there was recently an expansion called the fall of the dark brotherhood made available that added new cards to shake things up just give it a go and i promise you wont be disappointed
"it would be better if it had a bit of beamng drive physics but its already a beautiful game the prices for the dlc are too expensive for example the su33 the plane that i want till i first saw the game is one thousand, two hundred and ninety nine its too expensive nine hundred and ninety nine would be a lot betterthe graphics are amazing there isnt a more detailed game that this onethe controls are hard to learn but if you learn them youll have a lot of funits the most complex planeflying simulator its even beter than fsx flight simulator x go get it everyone its free unlike the dlcs and amazing"
this is not a review its more like a guide3 towers that u need wizard ninja and monkeythe strategy is too have a tier two wizard save for lightning and the other upgradesput a monkey or another wizard to upgrade it all the wayu shld be able to get ightning for ur wizard at arnd round four if u had been savingdo that and keep sending pink and yellow bloonsif the enemie is doing the same thing prepare for a zebra or a metal bloon rush at round thirteen or round 12after having ur normal monkey and ur wizard dont do anything untill round thirteen at round thirteen click on regan and send in the type two zebrarush like theres no tommorowit is almost all the time a guranteed win if the enmie does not know ur doing a rush
"i played the game like one year ago went level fifty in less than a month then i stopped playing due to some real life more pressing issues tbh i wasnt that much invested into card games but after playing gwent in witcher three i discovered they can be quite entertaining this game though is very much unlike gwent at least the old online version because the new one had lost much of its originality and revolves entirely around the es universe and lore with a very nice and immersive mechanic the cards are rather cool and i do enjoy the graphic style and overall design the premium cards not so much someone got lazy there because they have just some background effects instead of a fullblown animation like the gwent ones i can see that a lot of people have complained about the new interface and connectionlag issues but so far after like one thousand, five hundred and twenty days i have yet to encounter any such issue all in all its a solid card game and especially after they included the 3attribute sets with great replayability if u care more for the storystories than technical perfection in conclusion i really dont regret the time spent with this waiting for the elder scrolls vi now"
"broken game in its current state only because of how unbalanced it is way too easy to just save up and send regeneration rainbow bloons balance your game ninja kiwi not a fun game i know it says i have no time put into this game but thats only because i played countless hours on other platforms when playing a match you can either use your money to buy upgradesmonkeys to defend or send bloons at your opponent to increase your income usually that would be find but around wave one thousand, two hundred and thirteen if your opponent saved up money for a few rounds can just win with like a seventy success rate the ability to do this discourages players to get to further waves like three thousand and forty why waste thirty minutes on a game you could end up losing when you can just save up at round eighty nine and send rainbow regens and win in like ten minutes you dont have to play many games to see how infested the online play is with this cheap dirty technique without a doubt the majority of players play like this and it makes the game unfun to play"
early access reviewfractured space in its current alpha state plays well polished the development team is good at keeping the news current and features are addedtweaked in response to feedback from the community are there some good old alpha antics yes but they seem to be few and far between overall my only issue with the game is lower player count leading to occasional long matchmaking wait times i expect that this title will continue to grow and when it is released in its mature state it will be phenominal as far as gameplay the controls are pretty smooth and intuitive the battles can be intense at times your success is largely dependent on your ability to think strategically and respond tactically it focuses on teamwork the leroy jenkins will fare poorly good luck and good hunting
well tired to do all the shooting in the fallout universe ever thought of staying in the cozy place even building a vault after the bomb imagined yourself as an overseer well this is the place
very nice graphics and refined gameplay interface is a little bit of a mess and of course it employs the usual free to play strategy of making the game pretty slow to level up in and then offering a premium currency to boost things up despite this its definitely worth playing
this game is absolute garbage it takes hours to travel anywhere and when you do get there if youre lucky to even get near and have the patients too you get sniped by some guy two towns away theres no objective to this game its literally run find guns fight people die lose all gear rince and repeat the battle royal is trash as well it doesnt register you as playing alone so it would put you in with teams so itll be you vs four guys dont even think about running because you cant run faster than jogging speed dont even bother wasting your time
dear whomever it may concernit s my absolute pleasure to recommend realm of the mad godi thoroughly enjoyed my time playing realm of the mad god and came to know it to be a truly valuable asset to my steam library it is fun expansive and has incredibly great graphics alongside its undeniable talent realm of the mad god has always been an absolute joy it always manages to foster positive discussions and bring the best out of me and my friendswithout a doubt i confidently recommend realm of the mad god to join your steam library as a simply superb game and allaround great development i know that it will be a beneficial addition to your collection please feel free to contact me at suqmydik45gmail com should you like to discuss realm of the mad god i d be happy to expand on my recommendation happy gaminggnome
early access reviewthis game is a real good break from my dark souls playthrough and as someone who has played the last few games of this it is new but brings back memories the connection isnt that good but that is to be expected
i havent played card games beyond gwent both the minigame and its independent variant between the closed and open beta the mechanics of gwent have changed for the worse or at least are very much up in the wind at this point this showed up on steam and although very different the wide variety of mechanics are rather enjoyable oddly enough theres even a story which isnt half bad try it out even if you arent a fan of card games my only complaint would be that the special version of a card looks like compared to gwents usually they just have glowy added to them in this game
early access reviewseeing battleon in 3d is wonderful as an aqw player i always wondered how it would look like this game somehow still resonates with me its true there is a lot of grinding for xp but the players ive met were friendly and didnt hesitate to help with the harder bosses ive reached the maximum level which is twenty atm in about two weeks so its not that bad there is also the story so they arent really that boring take my advice farm in ashfall dragonslayer area you get high xp from the quests there and weapons i like the fact that this is crossplatform and it even remembers your quest progress if you log off before finishing the quest a fun game to play when youre not home as well from your phone you can play on your computer and then continue the quest on your android phone for example btw its full of spanish people so if you know their language youre in luck but also people from uk us and other places many of them are on twitter and i like the fact that most of the fanbase are old aqw players so the average player is older than aqws playerbase there are guildsgroups if youre interested in that and many discord servers
not a copy of hearthstone tries to fix bad hand and no comeback problems by letting you redraw starting cards once and for every five of your starting health you lose you draw a crad with a machanic where some cards can be automatically played from this draw lots of cards that are interesting because of effects other than their stats magicka ring lets the player that goes second tap it once a turn to get one magicka your resource to cast stuff three uses i personally think this is overpowered and should be reduced to two charges as it makes me want to go second so i have a field advantage for three turns but thats me and would need more input and testing to make sure unique two lane system some say it helps agro decks some say it helps get around defnsive weardown decks if anything it is new and the lanes are actually different one lane makes creatures unable to be targeted for one turn by enemy creatures so the situations you get into are intersting a fifty card deck minimum but only gives you a three card starting hand one on draw means that the vast majority of the time you wont get the card you need to effectively counter the enemies opening strategy unless you have alot of that counter really makes you fell like half the cards in your deck are useless because you will never get to them even with the draw on lost life yet the arenadraft mode only lets you pick thirty cards so i dont even know cards that help you if youre winning and dont do if youre losing these cards mostly involve the if you have more health than your opponent do some crazy thing for some factions their effects are fine but for others the effect basically keeps you ahaed for a good few turns on its own as your opponent tries to do something about it while he is already at a defecit a card upgrade system for some reason few people talk about this but it is prevalent enough a small number of core cards can come to you at a base level through the story more cards to new players is good but these cards are mostly worse than their upgraded version the cards can only be upgraded when you reach a prespecified level and dont think its like every level for the first ten or something one took until level seventyfive when i looked at it you can get the upgraded cards through packs so you can wait for rng or fork some cash the big problem with these is how some upgraded are straight better than the unupgraded the upgrade just straight gains a new ability with no increase in cost or any downside this leaves players with the terrible choice of play a card that is worse than your opponents or have it sit there for however many levels no reward for losing the game gives you a daily mission each day and you can hold up to three there is a counter for every three wins you get some gold and a single random card however if you lose you get nothing except progress towards a daily mission im really tired of this all it does is try to get you to fork over cash so that you can get some better cards or new strategies this hurts the people trying to learn the people who lost a very close match the people who lost from a bad starting hand etc
early access reviewgood thing this crap is free cause it is not worth the space like they always say you get what you pay for and your not paying for anything so dont download it why cause the matchmaking for new people doesnt work or you will just be waiting for a long time to get into something
early access reviewgermany is way too overpoweredsoviet is way too weakgame is unbalancedtanks are too overpoweredaiming sucksleveling takes way too longgermany and america has lots of guns and soviet about the half of those gunsgame is not ready to be played yet410 maybe after patching eight hundred and ten
breeding simulator of the millenium you literally put two people in a room with music while the rest works they pretend to understand themselves get into a room she comes out pregnant and he with a smile and never talk again tldr good game you dont have to spend a cent literally but the game is so fun youll want to buy something might get a little slow without those colas but its manageable you play this game like ogame for example
product received for freeif you like dragons and adventures online like me you will love this game but there are some errors one there arent so much quests two the graphics arent so good3 almost everything costs gems
graphics are ok but the grass is terrible i would crouch down and it would have me stuck looking in one spot the whole time adn when i tried to move it would move my gun and not my body i like the feel of the game but as some of the other reviews say you need a license to do everything its stupid go buy cabelas big game hunter instead because at least you can have some kind of fun with that two hundred and ten would get stuck and only allowed to move my arms again
i want to love path of exile i really do the developers are amazing and theyve created an action rpg that far surpasses the scope of diablo three they keep pumping regular updates and the new season ladders keep content fresh the story is there if you want to get into it but you arent going to play this game for the story the gameplay is absolutely amazing if you have a good build and thats where the game falls short for me building your character is brutal and unforgiving in path of exile a couple of mistakes ensure that your build becomes low tier garbage and you have to either spend hours grinding for regret orbs which let you reskill one point each or you have to build a new character from scratch some people enjoy this kind of rigidity i do not i cant honestly enjoy playing the game when half my time is spent alt tabbed into the build maker and character build guides online just so i dont mess my character and turn it into an unplayable dung heap
its ok pros reminds me of gran turismogood physicscons so many paywalls about ninety of the cars and ninety five of the tracks have to be bought just release it as a pay to play game and give us all the cars and tracks dont give us a slice of the game and tell us to buy the rest id gladly buy all of the game were it to be released as a p2p game like i said barely any cars for free and two thats right two of like over fifty tracks overall i give this game a six hundred and ten purely down to the realistic physics and the fact that it reminds me of gran turismo
great game would recommend came from the phone app this game has a lot of depth and the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper i had probably close to fifty to one hundred hours in but only had like half the achievments any way looking forward to the game not freezing up and whatever stupid phonehowever the font is horrendous its too small for a laptop size screen game developers please put in a font size manipulator i already have glasses i dont need new ones
i played it for two moths every day and i still couldnt make a good deck and the game is extremely broken sylvan and fury decks are too op would not recommend it i played elder scrolls before it for two months made three decks one of which got me to legend
monkeys that live in the jungle and in zoos are infamous for throwing uh stuff stuff of their own making this is a fun gamehuman opponents add a new twist assault mode provides layers of challenge and strategy you can also use your funds to purchase gadgets that will keep balloons from slipping by your defenses including tack machines and cannons you may rightfully ask why would i want to bother those aren t monkeys that may be but machines are capable of delivering blows that a simian cannot and viceversa whether you decide to put your trust in the monkeys or whether you employ heartless machines instead you have but one purpose to make sure the balloons don t get past you each one that floats by takes some energy off your health bar let s assume they re filled with mustard gas interestingly sending balloons at your opponent can help you accumulate a lot of cash which in turn can be used to really shore up your defenses as a consequence assault mode is excellent for players seeking a real challenge especially since some balloons have different effects that can devastate an army that s not been properly upgraded to counter them thats it and it why i love it so much
this game is garble it is a massive bungle and i just get bare unlucky and that init and haviel is bare lucky and that init pure bad i rate one hundred and ten do not buy i would rather own a pergeot two hundred and eight in poo stain brown
enjoy this game very much its like hearthstone but elder scrolls the story is very short spoilers three chapters long so if u beat every boss the first time it will take about four 305ish hours the dark botherhood expasion story is really expensive twenty other than that its super fun and will probably eat up a bunch of ur time
this is actually a really good game not great but good â ºyes somtimes the game crashes or the loading screen takes time to load and you still need to click the mouses right button to rotate but nonetheless everyhitng else is okay graphics and audio is okay cute baby dragons and customable items though you need to be a member to accessbuy the cool stuffs
early access reviewcreativerse is a great game it pushes our imagination to the limit and beyond you can build great structure in this game with many blocks which are unique the negative of this game is the taming system is still bad i recomend this game for someone who like to build a great structure out of blocks
"early access reviewmy grandmother almost died to cancer in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty three she managed to survive and was struck with it again in nineteen ninetynines but yet again survived but she was hit one final time by it in two thousand and eight sadly she died but in all those three cases of cancer together this game gave me more cancer than my grandmother survived all together nine hundred and ten would considering getting intense cancer"
early access reviewi have been playing for two or three months now and this game while not perfect is a lot of fun and truley free to play i have not spent a dime yet but as another mentioned they almost felt bad about how generous the free to play is so i may end up throwing a few bucks out to support the game i have completed all the campaigns currently available and have stock pile of gold to use on the new shadow campaign once it comes out i may play for two hours or so at a time a couple times a week i ago afk for extended periods of time so my playtime isnt as much as it appears as far as pvp goes i dont put a ton of time into building a deck or doing any research and have gotten to gold one last month not saying thats any kind of achievement but for a casual player with a lets just have some fun while i listen to podcasts i feel satisfied with it i like the flexibility with the power system
early access reviewyet another card game completely destroyed by suspect deck randomization for whatever reason my account was marked so that i had only two choices draw power at under ten or over eighty the mandatory construction was thirty three power which i bumped up to forty but it never mattered ten or eighty totally worthless not fun and after two hundred hours trying to find a deck build that didnt leave me with nothing but power or nothing but cards hey devs get a clue thirty three is approximately one in three i didnt draw one in ten or id draw eight or nine out of ten its stupid so your game is stupid
get this game it is freehands down 100times better than any fps game on market badfield four rekt by planetside 2cod rekt by planetside 2counterstrike rekt by planetside 2tf2 rekt by planetside two
ignore the five hours thats just the steam version im in tier five america and have a positive kill death ratio in the p51 mustang to anyone who has ever played this game long enough you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of christ for anyone else let me tell you why this game has so much potential to be good but it squanders it in the silliest of ways so let me just get this out of the way it is russian biased not even gonna lie dont have to because im in the safe steam forums where kgb i mean gaijin developers cant execute my posts imagine this its a terrible day to be a tanker the germans have a tiger and you have one t34 in real life you win by number advantage in warthunder you win because the tiger decided to replace its armor with paper and lined its hull with high explosive ammunition i can not believe how many times i have been ammo racked in a tiger you can be shot in the tracks and your tank could randomly explode how does gaijin explain the game is still in developement thats why when tanks first came out lets just reduce the listed capabilities of all german cannons by about twenty or if you wanna be technical model it at fifteen degree before even regarding what youre hitting so technically you could hit something dead on and still be penalized fifteen degrees and just be glancing off is this just one case example definietly not everytime they put new stuff in the game while completely ignoring existing issues if its russian they just say screw it raise all of its values from the previous plane times that by two and make it a ufo if its anything else case example the twin mustang which is litterally a p51 times two is actually now twelve in value instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically they add in more planes and with the twin mustang were too lazy to even code the second engine wtf logic is that look im not going to recommend this game this game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me were given false feelings of love frankly the kick that i can get out of this game is winning in a tiger or p51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that i like if you play for that i applaud you but for everyone else flying ufo planes and ww2 t90s you are so blind to how bad this game really is btw i can agree with many of the other negative reviews but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people the funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues but still think this game is worth it i dont as a ww2 history enthisiast i have been pushed to world of tanks thats how bad this game has become at least war gaming has a method to their madness here make sure you pray to rngesus
best why drm is kiling pc gaming simulator ive played for a long time game itself is crazy detailed and if you have a week spare to figure out how to edit registry settings and redownload the game several times id give it a positive edit on cooler head ive change the review to a recommended game itself is really good little dated gfx wish but competent would like to see the devs remove the drm from the steam version
absolutely destroys any arpg in every aspect f2p no p2w endless replayability and countless more good things to say if you are into arpgs this is your way to go forget about every other game
i got this game with a friend because we were bored and i am not disappointed its true its not a perfect game but its free atleast pros this game is fun when you play with friends or alone survival open world if you want to challenge yourself more open world is more pvp based because you can find at the start of the game a lot of guns and hungerthirst bars degenerate at a super slow rate in comparison with survival mode the maps are big i only played two caliwood and colorado i dont know if there are more maps caliwood is just a city buty its a decently big map on which you can play on tips if you dont want to get killed get on less populated servers common sense duhhh i recommend playing survival first so you can get used to conserving ammo and food also you can learn the map colorado or caliwood depends what you are playing and you can learn about some existing items in the game too in open world you can find items way more easily rather than in survival modecons bad map making just be careful where you walk i got stuck in a bus once if you get stuck just get something to kill yourself with a grenade or something almost nonexistent character customization depends if you care about looks or not there are a few glitches or bugs here and there but i dont mind them because they dont ruin the gameplay they are actually kind of funny xd clans can be made only on open world and also they set up only for the specific character you have selected and it kind of sucks friends too but that only when inside a server you cant make lobbies so that you and your friends spawn in the same area loading time takes a long time like fifteen seconds it spawns you in the game before you join the server so you might join already dead if you dont disconnect in a good spot
early access review1st game attempt ohhh you need to spam mouse one and mouse two now i get it2nd game attempt i get the combos now3rd attempt rank gamethis game is so hard man4th attempt up to current i wanted to win but howi tried button mashing that works i guess rofl7510decent 2d platformer gamenickname button mahing simulator twenty
game is t i know metagame is always t but in this game is absurd i mean at least in freaking hearthstone you have like four or eight decks in the season meta that are actually good and competitive but here you choose between two or three and its soooooo boring the developers even give you lots of free stuff just to keep you playing a perfect skinner box until you realize it s just that its not even a game i mean look at the time i been playing this im freaking legends and i hate itel juego es una se que el metajuego siempre es una pero en este juego es absurdo me refiero a que al menos en el jodido hearthstone tiene como entre four y eight decks competitivos diferentes a elegir por temporada que son buenos y competitivos pero aquí tienes de two a three decks y es taaaaaan aburrido los desarrolladores incluso regalan miles de cosas para mantenerte enganchado una perfecta caja de skinner hasta que te das cuenta que es solo eso no es nisiqueira un juego digo tan solo miren el tiempo que llevo jugando esta soy jodida leyenda y lo odio
ever since the developer switch this game has lost its charm granted that it still plays the same and some of the loading screen times have been reduced the gameplay experience has suffered significantly the table itself is reminiscent of hearthstone with less emphasis on card artwork animations and voice acting and more emphasis on garrish colors minimizing detail and reducing actual game time
note pls read about elemental evil more down in my review as i can only recommend the game until lvl 60the game itself is like wow on many terms as both are based on dnd pan and paper game however neverwinter has in my opinion the actual better fighting system because it doesnt feel as stiff as the wow one because you get feedback on crits and the characters actually do attack faster its hard to explain on the f2pp2w aspect i can say it is like in many other games you can have everything free if you one have no actual life and play 16h per day2accept that you will never have the gear to be good at pvp but you are gonna be good enough for raids and stuff3have sense for economy and trade stuff to make profit its not really that easy but i read about it but i honestly never tried that also you can get the premium currency called zen for free as exchange for astral diamonds these astral diamonds are the currency for the ingame market and auction houseso basically everything besides the premium items these diamonds you can aquire by 1completing daily quests2trading items to other players for astral diamonds3buying zen with real money and exchange them for astral diamonds thats the way to speed up getting actual decent pvp gear4 opening chests with keys you can aquire from premium store for a little amount of zensometimes yields more astral diamonds if you sell these items but its quite a gamble having these points said the game is pretty similar to wow but i prefer it due to the more responsive fighting system and the pve quests are more obvious when it comes to moving from one area to anotherin wow i actually had to google to which area i had to go next cause there was no followip questalso all the expansions in neverwinter are free so if you dont wanna play pvp ever you can enjoy this basically for freeupdate on lvl sixty content introduced in elemental evil expansionsometime ago there was the modulemodule expansion in neverwinter six introduced to the game called elemental evil many players looked forward to this expansionbut unfortunately i must say it isnt that good that is mainly because cryptic the game developer added new areas to the gamewhich is always a nice thing but these areas are recycled from the old ones and only contain the typical generic mmorpg quests also to make things slower you have to complete three times sixteen quests for each area but you can only have four quests at once and these quests are very boring so i dont recommend this stuff also the levelcap was raised with this module from sixty to 70many players expected new endgame content to come because of that but cryptic just recycled the old areas to level seventy and every player has to grind his old sets again which makes many players leave the game and i can honestly understand that so overall i would give this module a thumb down but as the game itself to lvl sixty is still very enjoyable i will leave it at that but i cant recommend trying to get through these quests its not worth the effort
early access reviewgotta say i am impressed never knew about this game till free weekend and i am getting into it now battles look amazing and gameplay is fun on a good team graphics are solid its still in alpha and pretty good
im ready to be downvoted into oblivion for what i have to say but i really have enjoyed this game so far i understand better than anyone the warz community has been spit on and dragged through the mud to many times everyone is so ready to just highlight the negative aspects of the game but im willing to admit there are some good features im a four year warz veteran who has played all the knock off of this game so let me say this is so much more than just another remake alot of people are talking about pay to win if they spent more than a hour on the game they would see the abundance of loot and how easily shop currency is aquired just through playing i feel like its balanced when really the only thing you cant get through looting is simply weapon skins pvpi expected to see a onslaught of cheaters with the thousands of new players but even with the dozens i have fought today i have yet to encounter anyone even suspicous the pvp is fun and plentiful i really missed the feeling of killing a group of people and seeing them each pop like pinatas the rush i get from grabbing the loot is something i could never get from another game for any old warz players or new people reading this for the time being i strongly recomend giving this game a chance despite what others say
early access reviewso this game is cross platform so you can play here then on your phone then on your tablet and back people here on steam posting negative reviews dont seem to understand that so they are just bashing it without doing research and understanding why it is what it is i have since played this game more and i have to say it is very light weight cheeky mmo they now have raids dungeons multple classes crafting think a more third 3d runescape for free it isnt all that bad and i feel it is worth giving it a go if you want to just mess around and have some fun there are microtransactions sure but they are not in anyway required as with the 2d version of the game
ok idk wtf happened so i was playing the game for a long time and realm was life then i stopped i had three accounts one for steam one for kongreat and one for the online version the online version was my main and kongreat and steam were just accounts for storing after i stopped plaaying i never really thought about itthis was like five monthsso now i try to go on my steam version and it just loads untill one hundred and it stops i had a ton of important items on my steam version and now i cant accsess it please help
this game is a whole lot of fun its like world of tanks meets a moba except space ships capital space ships there are many ship types and each is interesting and fun in its own way each match runs about thirty mins with a competant team game play heavily favors teamwork i see myself spending a whole lot of time in this game my only criticism the ships handle like submarines subs in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
im both a gun nut and a simulator fan and this gamesimulator are somewhat of a beauty the only problem for me is my own mental capacity i just cant remember where the part go high detail and the graphics are above nice i like it
early access reviewthis game is the best you can progress alot but still needs a little bit more in it like to chop down trees faster because those trees are so damn big from one tree you can get over one hundred woods besides that the game is really good
save yourself the trouble and go play another game that does any sort of simulating or realistic combat scenarios on the ground or in the air this game for the first year or so of its development release and subsequent updates was a good game a fun game a game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of wargamings world of tanks fancustomer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes all that changed with the introduction of their bs riddled battle rating system that they would with each patch adjust each planes and ground vehicles when they were introduced battle rating to fight enemies the players whom make up a top percentage and excell within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else every goddamn patch time and time again you see a major increase in the number of soviet aircraft with their ufo like flight models outperforming even though the soviet ufo should never have gotten off the airstrip other aircraft that make the ufo seem like a volkswagen the same exact is occuring on the ground as you see some bull t34 get ammunition at a thirty three battle rating think shermans and barely upgunned panzer 4s with higher velocity 75s that can penetrate and one shot a tiger a tiger at medium to long range all in all i would hope that those whom would be interested in this game go play another game armored warfare world of tanks or something besides wasting your time on some piece of that gaijin refuses to get anywhere near balanced called world of soviets oh wait sorry war thunder as they claim its called
are you a fan of hearthstone and enjoy all its bullsht and last minute tricks that fck you over at the last minute do you want even more bull fckery and butt hurt than that well here is the elder scrolls legends with even more butt fckery than hearthstone youll get fcked six ways from sunday in a dual lane system thats bound to fck up your day a rune system that will most definatly tear you a new a hole in so many places people will start calling you swiss cheese prophecy and ongoing effect cards will have a threesome with your rotting corpse and if you thought i was done im far from it if play mode didnt have enough butt hurt for you then test your luck in the arena mode with nine mother fckers to defeat in a completely unfair and bullsht game modifiers i rate it 1010would like to be a fcked again but in all honesty its just a really good game
early access reviewthis has been my goto for over a year it feels like the depth of m tg but theyve made it play smoother in a digital space its truly freetoplay new players can quickly collect enough to have at least one very competitive deck and build up from there there is a draft format where the cards you pick are added to your collection there are free repeatable puzzles available after the tutorial that start simple and go quite deep into the rules and interactions in the game the tutorial is just plain too long so if you decide to give eternal a try prepare yourself for that have some nice snacks and a ball game to watch or something
saddly this has the same problem mtg has for me your resources are in your deck i know a lot of people like this but i just cant play a game where i might draw everything i need to play but cant play it cause i didnt draw resources or i might draw only resources and be god danm useless yes card games are random but separating resources and decks was the best thing i ever saw and cant bring myself to go back to card games like this
i started playing smite about a year ago and i was hooked instantly the concept of mobas had always intrigued me but i struggled to enjoy the ones i tried because of the mouse movement controls and isometric viewpoint among other reasons when i heard smite was a 3rdperson wasdcontrolled moba with an emphasis on skillshots i had to try it and im glad i did the game is a fantastic teamoriented experience with a great depth of the character design and implementation is amazing the lore of mythological gods battling is a blast and the variety of abilities skills gamemodes events etc has kept me coming back for more ever since i started try it you wont be disappointed
early access reviewplayed when it was part of paladins for the day it was great and i like the changes they made as a stand alone game too although it can often seem like nothing is happening which leads me to the only things i would like to see done like a smaller map for more intense play and maybe some cross game currencies and battle passes like my gold gems and bp on paladins should be linked to both games as originally it was going to be one gamei think all the fans would love this same with the mobile game maybe even some skins to idk how or if they could but it would be cool to see a buck skinned toon running around the realm
early access reviewwhen this game was first released it was amazing i loved it to bits and when the battle arena moba gamemode and the boss battle was implemented i thought they where crazy fun best things the devs had put into it sadly after the updates that follwed the implementation of the battle arena and boss battle i am giving up this game after sixtytwo hours of playing it and reaching level ninetyeight due to the fact that they have implemented micro transactions loot crates and other terrible game modes and the devs literally said on there twitter they are changing the game and if you dont like it fk off just not in those words the devs got money hungry like other indie developers do after a year or two it really is sad seeing such a great game become a microtransaction based garbled mess goodbye robocraft
great idea but full of bugs and crashes many of the quests are not able to be completed due to crashes every time to try and finish them then you get to start them over and they crash at the exact place again and again dont bother installing unless you like alot of frustration in your life thumbs down
well i was enjoying it until game four when i kept experiencing heavy lag and i saw tanks go threw mountains and tanks appear out of no where and ohhh its not good but i think this is funner than world of tanks the first one because here its right to the point really nowhere to hide the other one lots of places to hide took to long to level upwell thanks for letting me try im heading back to wurm unlimited ive been working on a house for several days and im dealing with a cotton farm i planted cant wait to sell off my crops and finish my second level to my house
early access reviewamazing game not so easy to learn also hard to master you have to think about your opponents next moves this game is not just about muscle memories absolutelly recomend it
"early access reviewtldr one more roundlate for worksolid fps that has entered my rotation go to f2p game i keep coming back to and have yet to get burnt out on personal highlights belowno pay to win only cosmetics and even those can be earned over time only played tdm for now but i enjoy this more than any aaa tdm games availableremember when fps games bragged about their gun selections this game is what all those failed to deliver on plenty of weapons to play around withtactical reload round in chamber means one less round in magazine hence the two thousand, nine hundred and thirty ammo indicatorruns smooth even on a potato free ive spent more time with this game than five of the last aaa sixty games i picked up combined"
early access review be me downloads robocraft out of respect for genres and for trying it out not very original so build a giant br joins game finds a friendly player with a craft in the shape of a triangle flys into triangle let your mind put two and two together whole team laughs triangle guy gets mad because they cant move so he she rage quits lost the game because the whole team were at spawn laughing at the events unfolding its free so just try it
what a brilliant game and it is unbelievabley free i love flight sims and have cliffs of dover ms flight sim x but not x plane because it is a bit pricey for me i was after a modern combat flight sim and somebody recommended dcs world i have only played seventyseven mins just the first couple of tutorials and i am in love the amount of content you get for a free game is amazing and puts other payed sims to shame i am already looking at buying the f14 and a10 dlc the free to play strategy does work if you put out a quality product like dcs world which gives you everything that a full price game offers but then offers you more as dlc for a price because like me you will pay that price
terrible performance hit and crashes since v25 they just keep adding features without fixing the issues the multiplayers totally inacessible at all at this point it freezes the machine and i can hardly shut it down
i love this game completely i dont think that anything is wrong with it yes you can pay for items but it isnt required i dont know what it is about this game but i just absolutely love it please try this game out it may seem like i havent played it for long but ive got some good playtime
early access reviewi usually hate br games pubg left a really bad taste in my mouth after beta so i sold my beta outfit for 2k and never loaded it again i was hesitent to try roe but im so glad i did the game does so many things better than pubg and it runs soo much better for me this also being free is awesome for a free ea br game this is unbeatable
im not personally a very good player but i have played a lot and i really enjoy it so heres some information that may help you decide whether to get this free to play game in advance i suggest you go to youtube and watch some of cyrious or another youtubers videos about planetside two this game can be pretty confusing or overwhelming at first but these guys are very helpful i would also like to point out that while the community is full of salty vets who post on reddit about nothing at all they are very helpful if you ask them for advice they will help i would also like to warn you that your performance may feel like your a potato shooting marshmellows at teleporting space aliens thats an exageration by the way cyrious also has some helpful videos on how to fix that if you stick through and keep on playing youll find that this is an amazing game that nothing else can compare too another plus is that you will be coming in without any prior knowledge so you cant complain how the devs ruined everything as a side note see above salty vet when you start and this is for you who didnt watch any youtube planetside two does not have skill based matching this means that if you think your a real badass player on overwatch or something like that in planetside two your fighting against everyone with no restrictions to skill this may seem like a bad thing but its really not now go watch some youtube it will really help though i suggest avoiding igorawr for now you can go scar yourself latter now go have a good time and watch some youtube youll notice i used all caps to make it look important and spoiler it is
great game for those who have a cheap wheel and are just getting into the sim racing community while the community is small this game is creat for thos who wish to build up skills in order to tackle larger racing titles such as iracing or assetto corsa this game is extremely unforgiving you need a wheel in order to enjoy this game and it is hard dont be discouraged when you learn the skills and get used to the driving model the game is really rewarding while the expansion cars do cost money the base cars are great to get hours of great fun pros cheap initially good ffb great graphics lots of cars and tracks costs money great soundcons gets expensive if you buy everything low number of online players might just be because i live in australia hard to get started some tracks and cars are ridiculously pricedoverall review seven hundred and ten
decent game not perfectly balanced one of the better card games you can play it on android gwent is way better than it but hard to compare the two really if gwent was on steam and android it would overtake this by a long shot though the new expansion should breath life back into this game though it has a magic the gathering feel but with better mechanics not too complex easier to play than gwent and more convienent sorry for the comparison but those are the top two card games right now beside crapstone that doesnt balance their whole game so that will never be played again
could not register the confirmation email never arrived the help form on their website did not work kept complaining about a missing category selection there is no such dropdown labeled category all in all a pretty shoddy programming job tried to register in a different browser and the site says both my username and email has already been chosen which means the problem is on their end and not with my fat fingers
early access reviewrealm royale i am not a huge battle royale fan but i like what i have seen so far as with most hirez games i usually find myself able to enjoy their games and realm royale is no different i dont know how successful the game will end up but if you are a battle royale fan or a high rez fan i think you should check it out
good fundamentals pretty fun to play edit game gets seriously stupid as you get higher up in play godawful menugodawful customization controller supportgodawful uigodawful everything except the actual gameplay edit the gameplay kind of sucks too
stupuid querstion but how do you play it on vive i installed it and it runs and just takes me to a login screen with no instructions or anywhere to click to sign up or create an account or anything like that also there are are no instructions anywhere on how to operate the ui i see a white dot as i move my head around but how do i click on anything there are no instructions or help anywhere that i can click on sorry for being such a dense idiot i tjhink its going to be great if i can figure out how to even get in there
early access reviewfantastic little game really enjoyed getting scared by adorable cardboard spiders first run i made it to level three hundred and sixteen all i gotta say is wtf good job on this very disturbing d eight or nine hundred and ten
back then in alpha i use to â â â â ing love this game all you had to do was just farm robots and level up and unlock new crap but now everything is completely different different in a way of â â â â ing terrible weapons are unbalanced servers are laggy as hell players are toxic and rude like im playing with a bunch of nine year olds and all the staff in this game are pretty much â â â â ing useless in general i now understand why this game managed to get a mixed review best part the chaingun was released months ago and you still say its a new weaponry how is that progress
this game is really good i just love creativerse i just wish the pro dlc was a little more reasonably priced in india otherwise this game is the bestedit i bought the pro dlc almost hours after writing this review the experience was good and i could make the game easier with the new unlocked world options i can now safely say that it is worth the price
early access reviewgame has real promise does it need work sure it is alpha what amazes me is i play on a lower end laptop and it works and doesnt look half bad not great obviously but very playable really hope they keep up the good work and they dont try and bleed the player base dry from what i have seen though i do not think they will try to pull any bull on everybody would i recomend someone getting into early access yes absolutely need more people playingedit really needs a system in place to discourge people from disconnecting from a game i know that will be some time off if it does happen and i also know that not all disconects are not players quiting because the game is not going the way they think it should trying to be nice but something will need to be done eventually
i was plain dis dumb gaem crazy i name two of these dwellers as shane and lori and suddently iam getting raided by goddamn raiders really original so i look and shane is bangin lori in the social room and she comes out like seems pagenant and that reminds of thangs and fk this gaem
infestation the new z
its childish like many have said before me i havent played it for hours on end like i have other games but it seems to be a lot like wizards one hundred and one i would let my younger siblings play it and i think its fun for when i want to just sit back and relax enjoy a little bit of wandering plus i got an awesome two headed dragon also it allowed me to say that my character had been to another universe which gives me some research on the stories i plan on writing for her
early access reviewdecent free to play fps game it takes a lot of time to advance in the game for new players it may seem like an endless grind but i get the idea behind why they made it like this but play it long enough and it really feels more like a chore i really like how you can ride a bicycle into the battlefield though makes for some funny moments
this is hands down the most realistic hunting simulator available today its not easy and its not cheap but nothing even comes close in the hunting game genre yeah it gets negative reviews from people who either have no clue about hunting or can t afford the game but its an awesome game if you like to hunt or think that you d like to hunt the landscapes are immense detailed and very realistic each of the many maps is a work of art the sounds are realistic and captivating i wish it weren t so expensive to play and maintain membership but once you have all of your favorite gear the membership fee really isn t too bad considering what i ve already said if there were something better for less id definitely be interested but ive looked and there isnt so until then this is my hunting game of choice its free to try so why not try it and see what makes this the best hunting simulator available today

access reviewcompare year two aq3d to year two aqw and youll see just how far artix entertainment has come apart from being an absolute for ae games this is hands down the best mmo ive played items that can only be obtained through microtransactions are strictly cosmetic only every stat changing item or class is farmable grinding is not nearly as annoying as aqw not even close and if you go through the story linearly theres always a fair bit of challenge to the enemies as your damage and defense scales with your as well as your enemys level combat is relatively enjoyable compared to other more popular mmos classes are generally fun to use and nothing is so hard to farm for that you lose all feeling in your legs for slightly darker boots if the progress of aqw over eleven years is any sort of indication aq3d will be smashing wows in a couple years910 would recommend
fallout shelter is the best f2p mobile game ported to pc this pc version its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version for me its better this way because i no longer have to spend my phone battery to play including that the mechanics and loadings in this steam version are more improved than in the mobile version
access reviewits a fun game and i dont see why ppl dont like it there is nothing wrong with it i have not seen any game braking bugs the grind is fun and it keeps me interested all day maybe about five hrs and more
early access reviewafter jumping a little bit from spider and pumpkin cutouts i decide to run down the hallways backwards it seemed like a brilliant idea at the time i walk into a room see weird goo on ground realize this is when it gets ing terrifying read emo love poem on table turn around scream irl quit game really fun one thousand and ten scarier than amnesia
gameplay is really fun and competitive especially when the team is working together even though its a pug only downside is asia server is currently unstable and lag alot which makes alot of asia player to play in north america server instead though it doesnt affect too much but if youre using a center or pf position the ping matters overall a good game and being able to swag out your character makes it even better i made a big black guy gave him blonde hair and slapped on a pair of fancy glasses and then named him fatj hes fabulous dont judge
early access reviewim a big fan of the old ww2 online this game however is one big grindfest filled with pay to win players and cheaters if you want to have an experience similar to heroes generals rank structure i suggest you join the actual military although i guess even over there they have a faster progression in rank then this game has ten stars edit because of reasons let me paste this here i played the beta for over thirty hours before it was released here on early access they used exactly the same progression model
early access reviewi have asked for a refund for this game four hours is all i needed the game is terrible just go play guildwars two this is the fourth time this game is being released and it is utter garbage ftp in five months or less if the game lasts that long graphics would be nice if this was two thousand and twelve but the gameplay is terrible please get your hard earned money back and use it for something else thats the best advice i can give you
ive played for a couple of hundred hours with the mobile version and to be frank the pc port itself is pretty blackluster as it fails to add any new features besides the duel log on the right and enlarged card description on the left while playing however the game itself is great and its good to see its available on a new platform so ill give it a positive rating do note however that the game is really and while you can put together a good deck for free there are several decks which are nigh impossible to make as a free to play player at least an optimal version also the start of the game is really slow so if youre not willing to grind and get through the boring part of the game it may not be for you still with enough patience or cash it can be a really fun and rewarding experience especially in pvp duels
finished the story in three hours arena is quite cool but overall its not worth spending money on the second story is about as long as the first and they want gbp1999 to unlock i think not pros free to playthe one story you get is pretty goodthe mechanics are probably better than hearthstone which is its closes rival the deck types are quite cleverly laid out and have good internal synergy willpower is generally about helping your creatures out whilst intelligence is all about direct damage and synergising off of action cards for example arena is fun microtransactions will get you back in though im not sure you get the cards you pick which is a letdown cons cost its microtransaction based fine but dont then charge me most of the cost of a full title for one three hour story expansion youve got to be kidding complexity for all that its probably better than hearthstone its not a patch on magic the gathering the mechanics just arent deep enough very pay two win didnt pay out for the booster packs sucks to be you then all in all its a nice idea but its nothing more than a transparent cash grab in the end with some clever mechanics though outdone by magic pokemon and even yugioh if they lower the costs then the story modes might keep you interested for a while but as of right now play it until youve done the free stuff then drop it and dont look back
"i only played it because its the only game that has tanks thats even remotely realistic that ive found i discourage playing this game because of the developer gaijin german late one hundred and ninety four thousand, four hundred and forty five second world war tanks fight postwar one hundred and ninety four thousand, six hundred and fifty three soviet and american tanks you can see how that turns out theres also aircraft same dealtiger is and panther ausf ds face is3s on a regular basis oh and the russians get prototype aircraft which never saw service because the guns broke the aircraft im looking at you yak9k"
early access reviewwhat happened to this game honestly i remember this game when there was leveling and item tree before mega bots god i miss that game because honestly this is a different game completly
"early access reviewnice game requires heavy teamwork one big problem about the game thirtyfive hundreds players online but it takes ages to start a game matchmaking kind of sucks finds players five thousand, six hundred and seventy nine then resets starts againg like ten times"
could be a nice game no one wanted them to add anything new to genre or stuff like those only needed to be a properly optimized fresh mmo too bad even that they couldnt manage
this game looked very fun at first but to do almost anything in this game it wants you to buy something the controls arent that good either as the handling on the car is awful i would not recommend this game
ive never played card games unless you count monopoly this is my first and its not the least overwhelming with game knowledge its simply easy and fun to follow ithink im going to be playing this for the weekend then give another review but right now as it stand i would recommend this game
"absolute p2w game dont waste your money online gambling for kidsthe fur hire and spellbook and the rampage forest decks are so overpowered that you are guaranteed to lose in thirteen turns because of how gamebreaking they are this is an obvious payforpower where if you dont buy these witch cash you are given the worst card rng imaginable where it requires literally no skill to win because you can literally summon three monsters in one single turn with additional effects where you are guaranteed to lose if you are a parent keep your kids away from this game otherwise you will be finding yourself with ridiculous microtransactions on your bill konami should be indicted for literally introducing online gambling to children because anyone who claims that this game isnt rigged you are delusional or an idiot the abilities themselves literally control what cards you are able to draw you are better off buying physical cards instead and playing in person because konami cant rig your card shuffling this is how they trick kids into putting money into their game because not only do you have to buy the most op decks they make sure they place f2p players against you so you can get that mental rush like you are somehow good at the game influencing you to buy more when they introduce even more op decks its an endless cycle i put in about one hundred hours on android and i knew that it was p2w from the start they rig the cards you draw i literally filled it with mostly monsters and only drew only my spell cards in a row i had fifty monsters and fifty spellstraps and literally kept getting only spells or only monsters i even made it seventy monsters and thirty spellstraps and still got nothing but spells somehow i was only using the peak performance skill the entire time i even put multiple copies of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicates i even experimented my card draws with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful cards which were always conveniently placed at the very bottom of my deck i have mostly played with my friends and they literally saw it on my livestream that i would draw similar cards during my first or second turn and we even played about three thousand and forty matches in a row only to happen every single time they even rigged the dice roll cards to give you the worst dice rolls as much as possible as they are powerful and would allow you to stand a chance against the p2w decks it goes against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for using the right cards at the right moment i have the dangerous machine type6 and it literally gave me a six dice roll eighteen times in a row across all my matches always selfdestructing my card each time i only got to use it to its full effect only two times and the rest was nothing but one or 6i mostly played with my friends and even when they had cards more powerful than mine i have won more matches against them this just proves how massively rigged the rng system is and did my own personal research the math doesnt make any sense and pretty much forces you to buy the most op decks behind the paywall if you are f2p be prepared to lose a lot of matches and do a ton of grinding to unlock skills if you dont believe that the card draws are rigged they literally have a feature called skills that can be applied to your character how is this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain cards out of their butt that completely breaks the game what a joke here is a list of the socalled skills that can be activated below balanceif your deck consists of ten monster cards and ten spelltrap cards you will have two monster and two spelltrap in starting hand draw sense spelltrapcan be used each time your life points decrease by one thousand, eight hundred in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw a random spelltrap card destiny drawcan be used each time your life points decrease by two thousand in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw the card of your choice draw sense high levelcan be used each time your life points decrase by one thousand, eight hundred in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw a random level seven or more monster heavy starterif your deck has three or more level five or higher monsters with different names you will have improved chance of having a level five or higher monster in your starting hand"
early access reviewthe game was good now a great pile of c r a pcomunitly bearly goodsupport team doesnt give fudge about youi wonder how long this game is going to keep it up not so long i guessmany many many many many bugs which dev team and support also dont give a fudge aboutbalance in every single aspect is horribleat the end i dont recommend the game no matter the fact that is f2p with microtransactions by looks of the other reviews you can see people are not so fascinated another thing to the guys who created this pile of c r a p i know its not easy to createdevelop a game but after a hard work dev the good game you wasted your hard work time on slowly but succesfully up the game that is not effective waste of your developing time and by that i mean you s u c k at your profession feel free to ban me if this insulted you because i know you ban other players without any good reason and clue it wont be a new thing if you are venting on players who leave a bad review
ok so i understand the hate about this game and i agree some aspects are a little bad but over time i feel that these issues will resolve themselves even there are bad things about that game there are also good things about it too like original movie soundtrack and they even have the original movie cast as well even though this game is rough around the edges i believe that it will continue to get better
it would be a cool game if it was actually free to play this game is pretty much pay to play and pay to do anything fun multiplayer required a subscription so do the weapons and licenses which have a time limit fun for about five seconds do not recommend to my friends
early access reviewlove this game love the snowboard and the hang glider which make it much more thrill to move around enjoy the scenery of this snow mountain plz do more optimization on fullscreen sometimes get below sixty fps when moving
early access reviewfirst off please dont judge the game based on its long annoying tutorial this game is excellent in its current state there are lots of card games out there and this one has a few things that put it head and shoulders above the rest in my opinion attacking and blocking rules similar to magic the gathering even the fastest aggro decks require a little more decision making than in hearthstone because of this a very generous economy i have invested some money because i want to support the developer but by most any metric eternal is the most free to play card game out there free pve with decent rewards interesting mechanics and not too much randomness many viable decksall together the strategy is deep and the games are a blast give this game a shot and struggle through the tutorial
early access reviewawesome gameplay with good game mechanics but if youre new and dont purchase good ships from the beginning without even playing the game properly youre gonna have a hard time finding a game ive spent this entire time writing this waiting for a match sooo yeah
ah everquest we meet again this ing nostalgic timesink is something that i wouldnt really call a videogame an adventure rather an experience a phase it comes and goes sometimes it lasts for a long while sometimes a short burst a lot of the time you find yourself returning back to basics and such this er is very different to the first everquest yet still deep and loving you can explore with friends and go on a mystical journey or more importantly you can go on your own the lone warrior adventurer explorer you will fail you will succeed youll dance laugh cry heck youll even fall asleep you will gain knowledge of the lore aquire sets of particular skill view many landscapes and battles till your eyes tear up everquest is now on steam and in the heart it hasnt changed a bit although the population is now three the graphics outdated and i dont recommend it at all i lied i do recommend it the thousands and thousands of ing hours that ive spent scream at me to recommend it even though i dont want to its everquest or your life you choose you only get one childhood and one adulthood norrath or your ing life play it or dont doesnt really matter to me the original is deeper and worse for your health this one is slightly more casual just watch where you step
early access reviewamazing game ive been playing since early beta and have watched the developers update fix bugs and make improvements on a daily basis very polished for early access so much funmy two requests is that the developers bring back the old map as an option and also create an oceanic server if that happens itd be a nice addition to the best mmo shooter ever
great yugioh game that still active online also i can transfer my mobile account to pc version thats great and i spend more time on this game somehow i think its need community like guild or clan in the game so we can requesting card or whatever this good game
i like how realistic it is but the only downside is how much you can do for free you have to pay for the rest in my opinion you should add all the animals and half the gunsbows and pay for the other half of guns please and dank you all in all its good
fun little time waster if you are inbetween games or waiting for something packs seem to cost a bit much got the legendary pack with humble bundle so had a little boost its not for everyone but its not bad
matchmaking is a joke in this game for tanks it everyone vs us and ukplanes for us is side climb for 20min and die because they are always still higher than you you will always be uptiered no matter what gaijin will nwever listen to you you will always get the spawns for a map because balanced map design is a ing joke to gaijin if you want any possible fun play anyone but us and uk because they are just there to get curb stomped gaijin and this game on the positive side its 1000x better than any wargaming game except the ships
if you like diablo and was discouraged by diablo three or just want a great free version of the such then get this game the graphics gameplay online and even the story makes you feel like it wasnt free it can be original in its own aspect but keeps it simple and familiar to you personally i loved the online play and the customization of a home but the trading felt a little odd for me but it still works eight hundred and ten
i was really hoping to like this game but sadly i had to uninstall it i was doing pretty well when the game crashed when i logged back in i still had my dragon but my quests started over so it wanted me to hatch a new dragon but i couldnt it wouldnt let me move past that quest even if i tried restarting the game i had to delete my profile and start over only for it to begin freezing to the point i gave up
early access reviewa very fun third person shooter moba set in gee dee space yall its very tactical since the ships move and die slowly it has a great balance of mechanics to keep you hopping around the battlefield trying to push grab gamma which gives a combat buff and push on base its in alpha at the time of writing this review so there are bugs abound but surprisingly playable despite matchmaking connection issues lag and other bugs pros very tactical teamwork individual skillships have different graphics except gamma and bases which i believe are stand in modelsecg is very transparent with their development model and even allows voting on certain gameplay issuesin game boosters are used when you want to use them they double the xp or credits earned on a single battlefriendly communitycons lots of disconnects right nowlagginessship unlocks are still being developedhonestly i hate to put those cons in there since it is alpha but just to inform anyone wanting to get this game there are still quality of life issues

its a nice game better than wot because wot can sometimes be brutal but their is one thing i hate about this game its the money system i keep loosing money i didnt even use my abilities nor get killed in early rounds seriously the money system here can sometimes be annoying loosing a big amount of money but the game is really fun playing with friends is what i like the most
product received for freeearly access reviewtldr this game used to be great however it slowly descended into incredible grindyness and reliance on random rewards outside your control i want to preface this review by saying robocraft used to be a good game combat was fun building was fun and your performance was influenced greatly by your skill to an extent it still is fun fighting is still fun and so is building but whats wrong now is progression and rewards before the latest update epic loot there was an rp correction patch rp is the currency you used to by parts players were earning too much in certain gamemodes and not enough in others they were made equal however this was still a giant difference between old and new rp rewards this extended the time it took to buy certain end game items by hours if you sold a part you received exactly half the amount of rp you used to buy it here is the bad part random rewards as you can probably tell rp provided an easy way to predict when you could afford a part robots often need four to twelve of the same piece to function correctly building robots was easy and fun it didnt take long for you to slap that shiny new antiair cannon on your robot now you dont get rp by playing instead you get a crate this crates probabilities of getting a better item are so small you shouldnt even try these crates do not factor in time played or the score you get or any other thing you do in battle it only cares about leader board position and wether you won or not parts you dont want can be sold recycled for a set value crates based on leader board position is a terrible idea currently everyone is fighting against their own teammates for that shiny purple crate killstealing and tower stealing are extremely popular tactics however the problem has gotten better with armorgeddon as all crates are boosted two rarity levels meaning many people can get the purple protonium crate for some reason sell back prices recycle rates for parts was greatly reduced iirc there was nothing in the patch notes for epic loot that this would happen recycle rates for the cheapest block fell from fifty to ten the highest recycle rate for any item is iirc thirty three this is a massive artificial extension of the time needed to complete a robot the second worst part about this update is we have not received a reason why epic loot was delivered to us freejam is giving the illusion of communicating with their player base by making polls for which qol quality of life features we want implemented first mark lead designer and ceo of freejam released an article on robocraftgame com titled state of the game may two thousand and sixteen mark says he doesnt want to implement one of the changes suggested by the community put currency in crates he says they wont do this because he doesnt want a currency based economy my question to him is why freejams community manager reads almost all threads on the forums at least he says he does he doesnt always answer them you cant expect one guy to give an answer to hundreds of threads a day can you he does respond to some of them but he never responds to many threads asking why epic loot was made or suggesting solutions to the problems mark also didnt address any other solutions to the problem many of which are extremely easy to implement one solution being to raise recycle rates of all parts to fifty no response you could say that epic loot was the straw that broke the camels back me being the camel breaking meaning me writing this review there have been many terrible updates before this one team orders and robocraft unleashed are good examples another problem with freejam is that they seem to think we will stop playing the game after we get to level one hundred and fifty and have a robot we have completed this couldnt be more false if the game is interesting we will continue playing honestly dont expect this game to get better freejam has never completely reverted a major update only one small feature friendly fire we dont even need a complete reversion we just need to buff recycle rates ive never written a steam review before i have trouble writing essays just let it all flow out i guess even though i only have a little over one hundred hours ive played this game since october five twenty fourteens to mark ceo of freejam why did you think loot crates and random rewards for doing well were good for this game what was wrong with currency why do you think we progressed too fast in the past i want this game to succeed it used to be great the best game ive ever played i want this game to be like that way back in october two thousand and fourteen the game was perfect the core gameplay was decided on it made sense regular content updates like weapons movement parts and most of all maps would be enough to keep me interested im sorry i just cant recommend this game to someone without them also writing an angry review and uninstalling too if you see me ingame im likely grinding
early access reviewits an early access game i understood that when i bought it there is some bugs but theres also an update every day fixing things the translation is getting better by the hour and the developers are actually trying ive played three classes so far highest on a ranger and really enjoying the game i like the scenary i enjoy the combat its quite fun theres lots of room for growth and i hope they read the zendesk suggestions because it has the potential to be an amazing game in due time
path of legends is another great indie game to add to eas records of acheivement you start of with a selection from various characters these include lulu the dark witch taric the holy one and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger i myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there in any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game theres nothing much to it at first you are lying face planted in the dirt you learn to survive as you craft with various tools immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands but i suppose this could be attributed to yi being a badass and so it can be justified eventually you can build yourself a nice hut and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost you get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up but i never was a fan of dlc so i dont support eas decision to monetise indie games like this after you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of yis personal struggles from his japanese heritage the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section where you meet rico from just cause two rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game fortunately for us yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly the hook allows you to make it to the central island where the plot thickens once yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life the game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on you need to take out key military instillations over the island such as propaganda stations and fuel depots to try and win over the local populus once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island the final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the hq which span deep underground yi uncovers the secrets this place holds the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about this clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise the artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by tom ultman from this point on yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go space the game ends with yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons once you make your choice you can hitch a ride on the ebon normandy a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight you can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island or just go solo in any case you leave the island and make your way to eden prime and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on until next time stay snazzy gamerz
at first when i played this game i wont lie i got hookedi couldnt stop playing at all trove is a really fun game but it is very time consuming to me this game is kind of a love hate relationship but from the ammount of hours that ive invested into this game i can tell youi would definetly recommend this game to anyone here are some of the pros and cons about the gamejust in my opinionpros very addictingalways something to dolots of new content being uploaded into the gameunique variety of classes each one gives you a whole new experience promotes creativityfun with friendsnot p2wmore so pay to boost fastpvp is funonly when your power rank is over fortyfive hundreds at leasteasy character customizationsame with weapon and gear customizationcons servers lag and throw you around the mapgamealso may result in being forced out of gamegets repetative might need to take breaks from it now and thenrequires alot of farming and grinding especially when you hit lv twenty in game also for in game money gearmountsetcservers are down lots its a really great game when you can actually play it from servers being derpy p
early access reviewhaving played pubg and fortnite i prefer realm royale as the map feels very diverse with different climates in each pocket of the map and not the mention the unique class to choose from which differentiate itself from its competitors it is still rough around the edges and the animation seems clunky but given that it is in alpha there is still room to improve its not a rip off of any battleroyale and it has a potential to be a damn good game i recommend trying it with an open mind and not be an like the fortnite fanboys
early access reviewi think this is on my top three favirote tcgs of all time just wish they added more draw power to make up for the fact that seventyfive card decks with min twentyfive land makes mana screw happen quite often
我这是第一次写一个游戏的评测 不知道该说什么但我只想说这是一个好游戏 不管是跟小伙伴连机 还是自己探索 都很有趣 虽然没有中文但这是一个免费游戏 我们还能要求什么呢 最后我就过分一下吧 我们需要中文we need chinese中国語は必要nous avons besoin de chinoiswir brauchen chinopotrzebujemy chinprecisamos de chinêsнам нужно китайский เราต องการภาษาจ นχρειαζόμαστε κινέζικα
early access reviewive only played a couple of battle royales but this one feels much better by far its not goofy or cartoony the environment is great and the weather changes really add a challenging dynamic that changes strategy and difficulty of each match theres some minor clipping and display issues i saw someone sneak up on me because of a graphics glitch and i fatally fell down a gradual slope that should have been easily walkable the developers seem to really be invovlved and address issues raised and im glad theyre taking this seriously and not treating it as p2w or a
quite possibly the best free to play game out there it definitely follows the core mechanics of diablo but does them even better hours upon hours of fun with friends highly recommend
early access reviewthis game really started out with so much potential but it all went downhill when the devs decided to make the game pay to play whats the point of playing when i could just take out my credit card and get whatever i want the point of a progression system is to let people learn to play the game before giving them all it has to offer but if you can just buy your way up whats the point of a progression system the thing that personally pisses me of the most though is all the unnecessarily useless features in the game like weapon repairing and the fact a scope costs more than ing tank honestly the best way to fix this game would be to delete everything and pull up a save from a two years ago it isnt to late but in the state it is now i cant possible recommend it to anyone
have you ever wondered what a game would be like if the developers gave zero fllying s about balance look no further do not play this game or the original if you dont plan on spending at least three hundred on it its literally unplayable after the first week trust me your hair will fall off its unavoidable if you download this crap theres not much else i can say im one hundred honest when i say that this is the most stressful rage inducing poorly developed game i have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming you can quote me on that update game is one less added rng loot crates also added more premium 1hit guns
early access reviewwhere do i begin when my friends and i started to first play this game it was a blast but this new update was the one of the biggest middle fingers that a developer has ever given me the fun is gone weapons are still more expensive than going to college i rank up slower than grandma walking up the stairs and it is less balanced than a seesaw with a sumo wrestler on one side and a thirty pound preschooler on the other if the developers would stop sniffing cocaine out of each others s and start fixing their mess i might return otherwise planetside two is starting to get me very interested69420 meh
a very good hack n slash game or diablolike if you want to name it that way thats f2p but not pay to win in any way it becomes a little grindy in endgame but besides that poe is a fun game that offers a lot of content for literally nothing it might become boring if you are not into creating new characters to try out builds or find exploring some areas over and over again boring worth at least a playthrough910 in my book
joined a server a person there expained where i could be to hunt the stuff that i had an license for and its pretty funny one u get into it sadly you need license for alot of animals so its kinda hard to know what u can kill and not kill when u arent using your tracking device
disgusting i call for a boycott on gabe newell for allowing dangerous terrorism training tools into the hands of children and remember he does it for free shame on you mr newell
early access reviewthis game is awesome d when i download it i thought its another version of cs go and i wont play it unless ten mins but now i am playing the game for hours daily xpi recommend this game for all the shooters lovers not only cs go loversnote i dont like cs go but i like black squad three
path of exile has to be one of my favorite games of all time ive put a decent amount of time into the game and ive still got alot of things to learn im a huge fan of hardcore and i think it really adds to the game when you first get into the game it feels slow and you have a lot to learn if you take the time to get past that hump and stick with the game im sure youll learn just how good of a game it is
this is simply another example of what happens when developers abuse the free to pay game model the prices they charge for content is downright criminal if you already own a serviceable rifle it literally costs more to play this game than to actually go hunting the free or guest mode allows you to hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits which gets boring after a few hours you have to pay for licenses for everything else which are time limited btw this game is basically worth a point of sale purchase price of about twenty five if you buy into their gimmick you will spend upwards of one hundred and fifty that is what these developers think about you
if you spend some time on this game it will definatly hook you up yes you will be addicted before you know it this game has somany interesting aspects which you will discover soon after you start playing it the best thing about this game is that it always have room for improvement and new content is introduced every couple of months which assures that you wont be getting bored of this game so easily
youll have a hard time finding a game with more possibilities however to reach those possibilities its a loooooong grind especially on your first few playthroughs dissappointment can hit hard when you get to high levels and realize the character you poured one hundred hours of your life into doesnt really work that being said its a very fun game love the graphics the style the whole item skill and passive system and its definitely worth checking out its a game in which there are almost always more things you can choose to do
early access reviewfirst of all this game is not a smash clone it plays pretty different from smash however it is also better in many ways the inputs and mechanics are very clean balance issues are dealt with quickly and the dev team is great super responsive to the community would definitely recommend playing use a controller
early access reviewthis is my first review on steam i feel the need after six years of being on steam to express my deepest dissapointments and frustrations with this game dont waste you time with this game if you are thirsty for a new mmo queues to play are almost innevitable especialy if you and a group of friends started characters on the only server that was available to you during the early access founders pack release i gave this game more than a fair chance i bought the deluxe which was stupid of me to do and hope this game would at leased be have legitamently playable but it hardly is it might say i have twentytwo hours of gameplay but i have thirteen of actual play time the rest is me sitting in a queue to play only to be disconnected after half an hour of playing to sit in that same queue again and again this is the first time ive ever felt compelled to get a refund for a game ive purchased and i will admit i persued a refund after my hour played because i have seen people get a refund and have put in more time than i have in the actual gamebut im not expecting it the game is no optimized the main city youll get max fifteen fps no matter what graphics card or cpu you have the game was completly overloaded during its pre release which is to be expected normaly but this is the fourth region that this game has been released in so they should have expected this and its ridiculous that they didnt seem to prepare for it in the slightest way possible when i started there was one server for eu but they claimed there was two there is now six or seven servers and three of them are full theses are just a few issues ive experienced personaly and i could go on but i feel like other negative reviews are far more in depth and better explained than this bottom line is dont buy this game unless youve done a lot of research before hand
for a while since closed beta actually clocked roughly one thousands hours before playing on steam and the first few hundred hours were really fun however the game in its current state isnt very comparable to what it was back then at its core its a fun game great mechanics perfect idea for characters sadly its in the wrong hands hirez went heavy on the cosmetics element after six years of development they are still unable to release even a single patch that isnt in need of some serious hotfixing afterwards when bugs do get reported it can take another year before they get fixed saw one take nearly a year and a half to get fixed if you intend to collect skins and whatnot and dont care about past content so you just want to collect everything new from the point you start playing then be prepared to spend one hundred and seventy five a year cause thats the price youll pay nowadays just to make sure youve got all the limited items released in that year so yeah if somehow you absolutely dont care about any of that or matchmaking or a rude playerbase then sure i could recommend it around one hundred mythological beings to have fun with but if youre concerned about any of the previously mentioned issues or youre only getting in hoping itll get better give it a pass and a hard one at that its getting worse as the years progress
early access reviewthis game is just the best free to play game i can find on steam what i like about this game one you can buy skins if u want2 five modes three custom matches with friends or other players4 less hackers then u think5 clans6 its just cs go but then with better graphics and you dont have to buy this game
early access reviewabout that game hello guys go push tohetherpo rusky what sorry ipo ruskywhat you meapo ruskymaybeidi na houy suka pizdec tvoy mat ebal gandonwait i dont understa you na houy you peendos suka pizdec
dont want to play hardcore mobas like lol or dota well i highly recommend you this game just for the arena gamemode an arena match is just about skill and how you play both teams levels have almost the same levelnot more than two levels higher besides this fun gamemode the game controls are pretty good the single gamemode that i played besides arena was joust3v3 match with one lane and a jungle
sack of game you lose connection in a game and you lose even if the game hasnt even started and youre just selecting your towers in the lobby dont waste money buying medallions because you lose any medalions you make to losing connection even though its a problem on the games side not the people a moment later and you can start a new game and suddenly the lost connection thing doesnt happen lost all my remaining medalions to this dont bother trying to play a battle arena unless you have 20x the ammount of what the entry price is
this game is worth your time its fun and can keep you playing for a long time its perfect for multitasking because you could be watching a video doing homework or whatever and still play this game on the side i originaly played this game on the bethesda launcher during beta and it was fun i only stopped so i could play the game on steam this game is a must if you love the elder scrolls series the only thing this game is missing is nothing ps im not a fanboy and not everything by bethesda is perfect aka fallout four not an rpg dishonored two bugs so dont even start with me this game is actually good also remember that all the people hateing on this game are people who are heartstone fanboys just look at the bad reviews and look at what they say in them who said that heartstone can and should be the only card game blizzard did not invent the card game so dont listen to them they are ilogical and are mentaly stuck in crazy fanboy mode
i have uninstalled this game after updated i have expected to upgrade some mechanics of the game but looks like never changed maybe it can be worse than original like as interface maybe i can play in future but not now sorry bethesda and newly sparkypants
early access reviewthis game is like a more itembased sm4sh worth trying if you play smash elsewhere but its a bit slower than sm4sh yet still faster than brawl the main items are weapons that you pick up from the ground you can throw these if you want but its like having a beam saber from smash the neutral specials are the only unique moves on most characters at the moment there are four or so characters that have six specials the rest just have two when unarmed everyone has the same moveset as well theres a donor coin shop but if you buy the game then you start with enough for a couple skins overall this is a great game with more greatness to come just gotta hope that no big companies buy it if you like sm4sh project m and melee grab this if youre a melee purist well sucks to be you tldr no tldr for you
i had over three thousand hours in this game by the time i one hundred completed the achievements some were boring some were tedious but generally they were all enjoyed the game has regular events and weekly free golden chests to help with gear and other resources as far as clicker games goes this is an incredible one easily remarkable as the first of its kind no actual money is needed as long as your willing to invest the time effort and patience you can play this game without investing a cent there are a few dlc content for this game that adds character specific gear which is a nice add on to invest in but it isnt a must
r i p at this price id prefer p3d xplane and other stuff dcs is a long time almoust empty servers those servers that are still working are lacking players and mostly u are up in the skies just to finish off casual targets like a stationary trucks or a free flight maybe even with no weapons it was fun back in time but now this game is obsolete i own like ninety five of dlcs and i can say that most of them are good only for a free flight what u wanna fight su27 on saber good luck m8 time to say goodbye
pretty much everyone hates this game because of the pay to win pets and weapon purchasing but the community is also god awful i have a lot more than eight hundred and fortyone hours on this game because i played it in web browser for a good chunk of time i enjoyed the game for a very long time and it was fun if you are into very grindy games that actually have consequences for dying then you will probably enjoy this game the learning curve isnt too steep for most of the game it just takes a lot of practice and grinding
early access reviewit isnt fair to review most mmos after just ten hours but this game is an exception though there is a major benefit to being able to play a game on your computer and pick up the same one on your phone the negatives outweigh the positives as a kid i loved artix entertainment games which focused on style and simple gameplay mechanics over a hardcore experience however this game just doesnt work with their formula why its an aboslute grind fest with too much attempt at being a larger scale mmo than their previous game i am more than half way through the game and so far not a single minute has been fun nearly ninety of all quests which are needed to level are kill this fetch that with uninteresting combat that the developers tried to cover up by making it more difficult to survive more than one mob at a time my question is if this was the goal why not just make aqworlds mobile espcialy with all the upcoming popular eastern mmos coming to mobile platforms its a game not necessarily lacking in features but in quality at its core would not suggest
i played for about an hour first deer appears at the fortyfive minute mark guess what its a female i dont have a license to hunt female white tail said whatever aimed at it anyways point click nothing misfire apparently this simulator has a no kill what you cant legally kill policy i thought maybe i would be fined or lose some funds but no just wont let me shoot it rep boring as hell if i wanted to really wait that long i would be outside not on a pc gam
early access reviewits all about shooting and a bit of teamwork so it would be a good game if the hackers got banned or something like that btw not bad six hundred and ninetysix thousand nine hundred and sixtynine fps on comodor69 free 400mb etc
early access reviewrecent update made things horrid new players are going to be screwed for battle and money income is now rng trash cycling hope you like spending real game money for random loot that is not cosmetic because you will probably get either basic blocks or cosmetics
if you have an inkling of interest in games like the battlefield series but wish that the scale was bigger that the game was entirely persistent and that you as an individual as a squad or even as an entire team had an impact on the game as a whole then planetside two is for you as an mmo planetside two delivers an experience that is as social and longlasting as some of the bigger names in the mmo market like world of warcraft eve online and final fantasy xiv online as an fps planetside two draws the most wellloved mechanics from heavyhitting genrechangers like battlefield halo and call of duty four modern warfare this game is absolutely unique when it comes to the gaming landscape only truly comparable to the original planetside and the ps3 exclusive mag both of which were far smaller and less featurerich than planetside 2over the past two years planetside two has seen numerous updates these range from new weapons vehicles and gear to entirely new continents reworkings of existing continents and mechanics which change the very foundation of how the game works such as the lattice update and the largerscale continental lattice the game has even been optimized to run much better than it did in the alpha and beta stages of development through the operation make faster game or omfg series of patches sony online entertainment planetside 2s developers have always had an open ear toward the community accepting feedback and tweaking the game according to the majority opinion as well as implementing playermade items through the ingame store soe even displays the games official roadmap on their website allowing players to view the games update schedule as well as voting individual updates up and down and giving feedback on said updates thus giving the developers an idea of what the community wants to see in the game i mentioned an ingame store this may lead you to believe that this game is slanted in favor of paying players this is mostly untrue every player has access to every gamechanging piece of gear in the game the only things that are exclusive to customers who use the games premium currency station cash sc are cosmetic items camoflauge decals vehicle horns etc and consumables which increase the players multiplier at which they earn experience players can also elect to subscribe to the games subscription model earning themselves a persistent experience boost which lasts until the subscription ends five hundred sc per every month subscribed and priority in the queue to warp to an alreadyfull continent once a slot is available fortunately the game is entirely enjoyable without any premium benefits and most players are perfectly happy having not spent a single cent in the ingame store in the end all you would be paying for is minor convenience rather than gamebreaking premium exclusives planetside two has quickly become one of the best games ive ever played and i encourage anyone who has even a slight interest in the concept of an mmofps to give it a shot
honestly elsword is a great game its just the community thats trash one issue iv been having is i cannot seem to be able to loadup kc via steam which is unfortunate because iv added the funds to my steam wallet specifically to load up i cant return from wallet to my debit so this game kinda screwed me over in that sense pls fix thx
i love this game especially when there are events and bonus xp reccomended to all of my friends some of tham started to play my favorite heroes are supports who are nuckers and pushers i highly reccomend this game to people of different types for tanky natures for passive and for aggresisive players for those who love strategy and enjoy teamfights
entertaining but mostly a copy of monopoly has same good element which is destroyed by use of coin based change option lose of connection ruined a few game just use the coin for high reward game dice roll are so fix so game is entertaining and encourage coin us which is waist of coins
product received for freewhat a great game this is dude good connections and balanced classes best fps game ever dudeack ack ack ack ack you would think that by now they would have removed the pyro
early access reviewalthough battle royale games are unskilled boring and theyre just becoming popular for some reason this game is funnier than any br games out there imo its got wwi and wwii simple weapons without any complicated attachments and scopes just two or three so far the only drawback is shooting which is sometimes frustrating hope theyll keep updating it
this game is awesome it may seem cute and not scary but trust me its scary af the first fifty rooms are just cute but from room sixty it will just get more and more scary this is a really great horror game and also it is free i really think you should give this game a shot if you like to be spooked if you do not wish to get really scared i suggest you do not play this game the first specimen is cute but the rest are really scary and also they will try to kill you and hunt you like i said awesome horror game if you want a cute game this is not what you are looking for
i played trove for first time on someday around two thousand and fifteen i loved that game my main class was a neon ninja that i levelled up greatly and had good equipmentsome days later i buyed a gunslinger class just to test itdidnt give it much attentionso i kept playingsome time aftermy pc broke and then it was just a pile of scrap this year i got a new pcand remembered me playing troveso i wanted to download it againwhen i didthe launcher was just the same and everythingexcept that when i spawned in the hubi was instead using the gunslinger classchecked the classes menuand my neon ninja wasnt thereit was deleted and every ing class were worth creditscredits you have to get with your ing moneyi can still remember back on twenty fifteens when you just needed the crappy gold coins to buy oneit was ez pz so after calming my anger down i checked the store to see the daily free and like nine of the i think ten things there were was things worth a ton of moneyand pray for the daily free thing i cant remember its name to not become a payable because knowing trion they are capable of doing that i posted the request to get my neon ninja back on the glyph help center and i created it over two hour ago and still no response and evenon this pc cs go runs at acceptable fpsbut this gameit crashes every second for no reason apparently after alldont get me wrongtrove has an amazing game conceptbut trion ruined it all they just dont care about us or the game quality gameplaynot graphical anymore
so far my experience with this game has been a disaster i have a great internet connection and yet some how i am having trouble connecting to their servers i got to sign the terms of service agreement three times because of this connection issue with their servers i also got to play the tutorial three times because after completing the tutorial you go the loading screen but here is the good part when you finish the tutorial the game crashes doesnt that sound like fun when this crash occurs you dont get a checkpoint or save to say you completed the tutorial i mean that makes too much sense instead after you bring the game back up from its sudden crash you get to play the tutorial again and listen to the npcs jabber on about the same bs great first impression grey box
deca games saved my life in the year elevntytwelve there was a young lad who had taken on his first rpg this wonderful game was called realm of the mad god he loved the game with all his heart by age nine he had logged twelve thousand hours in to the game rotmg was his favorite thing in the world nothing could surpass what kabaam had created for him as years passed the young lad spent what felt like an eternity in the realm he played all types of characters and when new ones were created he welcomed them with open arms nothing was closer to his heart than this game suddenly it was the year two thousand and fifteen the boy still played day in and day out for some reason he started to notice less and less content being produced his world was turning grey his days were monotonous shatters after shatters nothing would change sure one day there were a couple turkeys in the realm but that didnt interest the boy he just wanted to make realm great again the boys mind was hallow he felt empty inside slowly and slowly he felt less reason to continue his adventure the lava called to him come here its warm in the lava theres no need to be out there anymore the lava said and so the boy walked with his trusted speed the boy shed his armor and walked towards the lava his world full of sadness he noticed the graves around him he was following in the footsteps of his friends and guild members he blended in with the community he followed blindly in their rage with his first foot in already an angel creept out from behind the clouds the angels name was silex and he said my son this place will be new again you mustnt throw yourself away the boy listened and learned about the world of deca deca was unfamiliar to him yet it felt so close like a gentle mothers touch deca showed him things he couldnt imagine the boy stepped out of the lava with a bright light silex turned the boys leg to its original form he cast out the world of kabaam and the world regained its color ty deca
early access reviewi am not sure if i should give this a tumbs up or down its inbetween for me first off the launch was terrible could not play on the first day and it still has issues with the spash screen witch forces you to restart until you finally get past it takes thirty five restarts if you are unluckythe game looks great and has voice acting in it more then i expected but skills are badly explained and you have to figgure it out by trail and error not giving you any real feedback about what the skill does can be really anoying for new players also you as far as i know you cant rearagne the skills how you desire gathering is a pain if you want to craft and gather your own mats you better get ready to spend days looking for the mats you need as for each matirial node on the map you only get one unit you find iron you get one same for all the other mats i found so far in the game this needs to be reworked else crafting will become a pain atleast give us three mats per matirial nodecombat right now is rather repeditive as you will most likley use the same skill combo all the time press one then pres two times to compete the combo you can do difrent onces but it does not feel any difrent i think this game has great potantial but it needs some fixes i suggest you wait a while before buying this game to seehow things turn out
early access review1v1 ranked literally ragequit simulator 2015worse than gta v heists one thousand and ten ignpay2win nine hundred and ten game informeri wish people would stop with the fake quotes and ratings from our magazine95100 gamestar
early access reviewthe difference between players with legendary equipment and those with normal equipment is too great a legendary weapon has double power over the rest and are too easy to find
this game is great ive netted about 3k hours on ps4 and now im switching to pc this game is mmorpg meets dungeon crawling the game is heavily instanced which makes for adaptive environments you can actually seem the impacts you make on the world which gives you a sense of importance there used to be a foundryhopefully their still working on it where you can create your own scenarios and stories and quests that people can experience the level of classic fantasy themed worlds in this game is incredible and the environments mixed with lore books make for quite immersive zones to quest in the dungeons are a little lengthy but the higher level dungeons require puzzle solving that isnt really that hard but the idea is kinda cool ive made so many friends on this game that ive gotten atleast half of them to join me on pc and were going to make a guild together
whilst this game largely depends on xp grinding to unlock the guns for people wanting to learn about guns or just generally enthusiastic about guns it is a fantastic game it has a wide range of weapons with a feelgood reward for unlocking them a great game and well worth the tiny amount of disc space it takes up
not bad for a free game as someone who played this via both android and pc the game is extremely buggy when played on pc compared to android issues included audio chopping in and out subpar game mechanics and a major bug that corrupts the save file when the game is closed improperly e g power outage laptop battery dies i invested about twenty hours into my first vault and both my save and backup save were corrupted upon opening the save files all the coding for the save had been wiped with no way to retrieve it so while fun to play in between other games i would not recommend making any ingame purchases or playing when there is a chance the game may improperly close

for being a free to play game its actualy really fun you have so much things to do it can get boring at times and could wear you out thats due to either wait times to join a game or your planetank moves slow tank battles can be slow paced at lower ranks but plane battles could go 100x quicker if you get a good team by your side somethings that annoy me is that the devlopers like to make russian aircraft super overpowerfulsince the devlopers are russian as of now i didnt have to spend a penny on a thing and i still have the golden eagles that were given to me at the start other than that if youre into historic war games this game is for you
got allmost 2k hours in this game and i can still figure out new ways to play and build the chars i make and that means a lot for a player like me that is allways trying to figure out something nobody else has done the massiveness of the game and the constant updates from ggg makes this game allways fresh ggg has created originality in the sense of there desire to keep inflation out of the game economy which they have done by making every item in the game a currency in itself skills are items you find and use in sockets which means skills is a tradeable currency to every skill can get enhanced by support gems you link to them as an excample fireball linked with chain making the fireball chain between targets there are a lot of different gems and a lot of different ways to combine em and deserves a try from all gamers out there you can play this as a casual player or as a hardcore player that desires the competive scene at the first glanse of the skill tree in this game it might seem that you will never learn it but in my oppinion it is far from as hard as people make it to be events are being created runningly to keep the game exciting besides the new leagues that last for longer periods at a time with every new league they create new prices for both the hardcore racers and the casual players that just want to get the achivements or challenges to earn a price path of exile has gotten some critisisme for the famours desyncs since the release with the version twenty on the door step ggg has made an official statement they are adding a new network model to the game to fix the issue it has caused for some players on a more personal note on that matter i have died to em myself but over my hours of path of exile i have learned to avoid the desyncs you can cause in the game so for me the desyncs is not a problem anymore but i understand it can be an annoying factor for some players a quote from ggg themselves wraeclast is a dark brutal continent scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it were sick of the recent trend towards bright cartoony rpgs the art style we chose for path of exile is dark gritty and realistic wraeclast is terrifying and weve tried hard to do it justice in path of exile replayability is key all world areas including outdoors ones are instanced for your party and randomly generated right down to the magic properties of the monsters that dwell in them and the treasure they guard i coulden agree more
early access reviewokay so ive been playing this game for a while i was lucky enough to get into the closed beta and have been playing consistently ever since its very easy to learn got simple controls and simple concepts the characters are balanced really well you can play any character effectively at any level of play its just a matter of skill the game functions around a system where every character has two possible weapons to pick up from the weapon drops these range from a sword to a rocket lance and every weapon has a couple characters that use it the quick attacks on one weapon are the same across every character who can use it but each character has unique heavy attacks with their weapons as well in addition to the weapons there are gadgets that will drop around the stage a bomb a land mine and a spikeball dodging is really well implemented and will be important to your play learn to use it and it can be an offensive weapon or a recovery tactic in addition to simply dodging in addition using your dodge in midair performs what is referred to as a gravity cancel which allows you to use your standard nonarial attacks while in midair in addition to fighting with the weapons of the character there are melee attacks although there are no unique heavy attacks with the melee fighting this can be very important since throwing your weapons at your opponents can be a very useful strategy and you cant always get back to the weapon to pick it up in time in couch party and custom online matches you can utilize stances which change the stats of your character these are currently not available in ranked play in all methods of play you can use alternate colour schemes which are unlocked by playing with a character these do not provide any change to stats or boosts they are purely visual there is no pay to win playing succesfully earns you gold and gold can be used to unlock your favourite characters permanantly and a free weekly rotation allows you to practice with a few before finding the ones you like it is possible to pay for mammoth coins which will let you unlock characters faster but they will not do anything to increase the players strength in addition mammoth coins can be used to buy visual changes which cannot be bought by gold but like the colours these changes are purely visual the community at low levels in ranked or in open custom matches can be less than sparkling but once you get to silver in ranked the spammers and the people who will enter matches just to be annoying tend to be weeded away in addition the higher you get in the ranks the nicer the people tend to be in my opinion the best way to play the game is to find some friends and play with them custom online matches can hold up to eight players so you should be set on that front now that all the technical stuff i can think of is out of the way i just gotta gush i really love this game like so much its like if smash bros was better balanced and spamming wasnt a viable way to match skill dodging is smooth and beautiful and so many characters have really cool uniques the lore that the devs have put into the characters isnt exactly important to the game but its fun to read anyways the variety of the characters is amazing and more keep being added its so well balanced that the win rate last i checked between the most succesful character and the least was at an average of less than one game its so well put together and so smooth and so fun and i just i really love this game go play it tldr great game good balance no pay to win go play its fun thank you and good night
early access reviewit used to be a great game where everyone would mostly be diverse and bring different aspects to a battle that would make them different everytime now the weapons are badly mixing with eachother getting new items is hard and pointless teamwork is near non existent what robocraft was was truly beautiful this is just a disgrace to aswa
early access reviewhow can this game have such a good rating this game isâ â â â â â movement feelsâ â â â â â there is only ammo not a single weapon only axe and you cant change any options resolution or graphics at all must be troll revies
a ridiculous game that prizes itself on completely unbalanced teams there seems to be no discrimination towards experience and vehicle strength example ive seen one player slug six shells into an opponent only for the oppenent to turn around and one shot them so naturally a complete noob like myself would just be toyed with on every battle field there are steep learning curves and then there is just utter insult to injury just another clear example of how ftp is just ptw
i was kinda waiting for this its duel links but on steam instead i really really wish you could skip the duel school i know all of this i wanna be dr villian crowler master of techinques at duel acadaemy i wanna mechanize the melee i want to be the guy that informs you that a kuriboh is a bit pedestrian as i magically have all that i need to make two tributes give me the ancient gear golem i have an ancient gear deck it does not win often but new support will help tons lemme skip the battle school and get r i g h t to increasing the smugbut yea if you wanted to duel on steam this is a fine way to do it it gets the job done well enough but dont expect to sit down and build your dream deck your dream deck irl will always be better than normal monster beatdown and we all know it
early access reviewi would have recomended this game a few months ago before the horrible updates like wtf this game is less than half as fun as it was before the game modes get locked and what happened to upgrading your robot how you wanted to now you have the worlds most linear perk chart gg for screwing up your own game no one asked for any of this
i wanna gave a good rating but hell after playing it i aint gonna give this game any good review i install the mobile version of this game an it is really fun to play it after the announcement that th game have a pc release i install it as soon as i can but boy oh boy pro i can play without worrying my phone batteries like seriously this is just a better part of this gameconsno maximize button like wtf man i cant even see the button on the bottom part of this gameonly three cards on field seriously man wth hard to swipe to switch to studioshopetc like wtf you put swipe into pc my conclusion is you guys are lazy as heck if you wanna play this game my advice is you better get the mobile version its way more better than this mess
early access review large sprawling battlefields very detailed and impressive amount of customization options leveling skills is done through accolades which helps one tailor their character to their playstyle vehicle controls are smooth and enjoyable stat buffs can be gained by displaying the appropriate medals this feels rewarding but doesnt necessarily break the game despite microtransactions gameplay appears agreeably balanced this game places a massive and overwhelming focus on microtransactions everything is for sale at any time and the prices range from moderate to outrageous poor terrain rendering matchmaking often takes an inordinately long time to find a game poor squad system there are some bugs that still need to be ironed outlockeproposals big day outcommunity groupcurator pageserious steam reviews subreddit
this game is not bad butcan you add something new please like new large map or make a little chance the grafikand etcthis game is good but it seems like diffrent when we watch the trailer on youtube oryour adsthats all what i need to chance or fix
"well if you are a new player then maybe youll like it if you are like me a loyal valve gamer for at least ten years or more i do not recommend this game to anyone any longer now that they messed up the players choice to choose game play modes and server listings are gone this game doesnt suck if you give them money im sure but the four thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine i paid for the game when it first came out doesnt mean jackshit apparently"
the gameplay is good but not very competetive my greatest issue with the game is the terrible support and the unstable build only usable guides are made by fans extensive issues when even the slightest problem occues during setup phase i cannot change the res outside of a battle and when i changed inside a battle it caused the game to blackscreen an issue persisting after restarteing the entire game and trying to join a new battle and when i tried to verify game integrity it lacked about six thousands files some of which it couldnt redownload due to not having the privilage to gain missing files and i reinstaled the game just ½ an hour ago tldr decent casual game terrible build and stability
early access reviewthe game had server issues like nearly every single mmorpg at launch but they took servers down and added more and it was fixed by second maintenance they had some other bugs like the splash screen bug but they addressed it within two days and fixed it they had seriously long queues for some servers but they did a temp lockout on the more populated servers to stabilize them no mmorpg release is perfect and theres always tons of unknowns that occur but neowiz is doing a fine job of handling every curveball thrown their way and making quick fixes their communication could be a bit more frequent but their exec producer did write a well detailed apology letter that explains every single thing that everyone was wondering about and addressed every single issue neowiz earns some respect in my book for the way theyre handling this release the game itself is a lot more fun than i expected and im enjoying taking my time to learn the skills and pvp combos and stopped rushing to fortyfive since they announced it would be twelve weeks before they add the true end game content to this build overall i definitely have to give it a positive review
currently this game is plagued by hackers and people owning overpowered as hell guns that you need to buy with real cash or grind for like ten years to get them with the in game currency you will not will a single gun fight against people with this gear unless you shoot them in the back using the default weapons so unless you are willing to spend some cash to get some starter packs prepare to get pwned a lot till youll farm enogh crets to buy good weapons
tldr spawn in kill things die buy new gear repeat nine hundred and ten would buy new horn sounds and cosmetics again continents lock and unlock frequently enough you dont have much time to get bored of one or the other occasion bugs but nothing too awful only thing i would like to see added is a cert two db cash conversion system even if it has a low exchange rate however seeing as how its a f2p game i see no problem with helping out a few starving devs and buying some flashy cosmetics edit i bought another horn sound please send my regards to my poor wallet
i am glad i quit the game before puting any money in to the game aside the necode now you need track ir to play arcade not to mention that you not only have to pay to win you now pat even to advance because you cant buy a new plane uless the previous one is fully upgraded do yourself a favor and try a real fly game
only played for an hour but so far it seems like a solid game will take a fair bit of stuffing around to get ffb and handling settings dialed in tho why just why dont all the other sims sound as good as this i found myself hitting the limiter on purpose just because it sounded so good only down side are the potato visuals bit of a dampener but the incredible sounds make up or it
school of dragons is possibly one of the worst mmorpgs to date remove this garbage off of steam its all pay for this and pay for that and the graphics make me want to shove spoons down my eye sockets
early access reviewimagine u make a good game people enjoy then u change everything up for the worse and alter core gameplay mechanics for no reason thats realm royal enjoy the meta it will be constantly getting worse and worse every week
game was a blast to play before the latest update seven hundred map is terrible ui is terrible the stupid pre match character screen is a joke like something out of street fighter this game literally went from being fun to i dont even want to play it anymore700 ruined it
its not a bad game if it wasnt for the in your face pay2win like a coin operated cabinet the game does nothing beyond showing you how to pay but not play playersbots are just there camping waiting at all times the only cool part i enjoyed was the night time fighting with muzzle flash during combat thats itin summary it is like dayz its more stable and has less dynamic weather more weapons thought and you can jump very oddly in place it plays like a console game and looks like a three hundred and sixty game it is definetely fun with friends who have money prob not for kids as there is textvoice chat
path of exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system active skills are not required by leveling up but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like itsorcerer barbarian and melee wizard sure why not corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what i meanthese unique settings truly makes combatting and looting really fun as a f2p title path of exile is simply huge with its solid gameplay great graphics comparable to d3 and unique system anyone interested in hack and slash or rpg in general should check it out
heed these words for although it is too late for me it may not be too late for you this game is like heroin i want to stop so badly but i just cant the community is awful and the matchmaking makes me want to cry but still i cannot stop get out while you can
early access reviewpros it can be good if neowiz listens to the feedback and actually does something cons not polished no where near finished enough to be released optimization is incomplete localization is incomplete and wrong no forty five content there is no endgame content currently available pvp feels bad pve feels bad story needs help combat system is not fluid if you played any other action mmorpg you will be disappointed hands down class imbalances
achievements dont workscreen size isnt big enough and cant be changeddueling is kinda slow due to annoying and unnecessary dialoguenext to no difficulty when it comes to dueling a i playersnormal game is betterfck konami
im a complete newbie to playing this sort of game and i absolutely love it customising your character their history powers at the start is really cool theres lots of scope to upgrade youre weapons abilities as you play for the newbie like myself the ingame voiceover help when its time to upgrade a weapon or perform a new movestrike is really useful the landscape design is amazing the views scenary are so detailed and helps you to loose youreself in this mystical game i would wholeheartedly recommend neverwinter whether youre a newbie gamer or seasoned veteran theres something for everyone
very fun game although please make it a little bit easier to earn gold silver and experience currently i have an m3 lee and ive been playing for two weeks now so please make it a bit easier thanks for reading my review
early access reviewspoiler alert this is probably going to be quite a long review so ive been with hirez since global agenda and i loved every game they made i was a huge fan of ga tribes ascend is still in my top five favourite shooters which i play from time to time smite was the game that introduced me to mobas and right now im playing paladins a lot so when realm royale came out i naturally started playing it right away and oh boy did it raise some expectations game had a lot of potential and some of its mechanics like class system and crafting based on kills were really fun and cool ive played rr for a little while deciding to come back when its a bit more polished and finished because it had some glaring issues which was to be expected from early access alpha stage game like ctd after like every second match ended and when i come back after a couple of months i find this sht so let me count everything they did or didnt since the last time ive played and ive played just one game just now1 class system got removed that was my first what the fck seriously hirez you literally removed the thing that differed your battle royale from other br games this is one of probably two of your worst decisions ever the second one being stopping any further development of one of the best shooters of its time tribes ascend i could forgive that because smite was pretty good and i switched to other games2 the weird as fck new weapon and skill system so basically this problem comes from the first since they removed classes while keeping all the abilities and weapons in the game they had to ballance it out by restricting every existing weapon and ability to a certain slot to avoid op weaponability combos for the same reason probably number of usable abilities was cut from three two active abilities and one movement ability to two eleven respectively even though its understandable it really kinda blows that i cant use for instance heirloom rifle with a sword like wtf three no more legendary weapon crafting in forges another wtf hirez moment another thing that defined the flow of gameplay before if you got luckyoutplayed someone and killed someone you could get yourself a shiny legendary class weapon and had a much better chance at winning the game all while risking a lot to farm shards and spending time at forges getting ambushedsurrounded in them a lot of fights were around forges now why would i even use them four amount of loot this is a short one but amount of loot found has been brought down to like five thousand and sixty of what it was at best in the game i played i searched a whole town and not a small one about seventy eight houses and got literally two weapons one ability and about fifteen shards i dont count potions and those weird chicken things as important loot and yes i know potions are important thats not the point its literally impossible to farm enough shards to forge something especially if youre playing with a squad which actually brings me to my next point5 6man squad restricted gameplay seriously just why this game already had soloduo play and now its ranked soloduo coming soon wtf what if i dont want ranked i mean ok this could get changed anytime i guess since this is alpha but being locked at 6man squad gameplay when youre playing solo ninety five of the time is a biiiiiiit aggravating6 the ctds didnt get fixed like literally i played one round and the game ctds after it finished tldr the game was in a really good shape right after its early alpha release but hirez for god knows what reason plunged this game into a shthole right now its a clusterfck of all weaponsabilities that it had before all while still poorly ballanced with a lot of questionable desicions made about core game mechanics big bugscrashes still there change core sht back before its too late hirez dont mess with core mechanics this was supposed to be a classbased battle royale if by any chance hirez is reading this listen i am your long time fan ive played your every game since global agenda and right now youre making second of your biggest mistakes ahem star developing tribes again ahem please revert those stupid changes just make it as it was add some freakin skins make the map bigger and fix some bugsctds and this will be a wonderful game dont do this to yourselves
early access reviewthis game is just awesome i dont know what it is about it when you go in you see the cutesy side of it and you think no biggie but it is a very eerie and creepy game i love this totally recommended
early access reviewits a good and fair game probably has the best returns for investments of any of the digital tcgs floating around on the market you get a lot of stuff for just investing a minimum amount of time also the most interesting features gauntlet forge and draft are fairly accessible a few games and gauntlet runs here and there will keep you with a constant flow of ingame currency which allows you to participate in all of them so why am i giving this a thumbs down there is one major gamebreaking element in here rng its a mess in this game literally the only reason ok ninety why i lose games is either getting manascrewed or getting flooded even with an absolutely decent manabase and fixingfetching its frustrating its pure randomness and allthough we cant avoid this in in real life tcgs it should be avoided in digital games as it doesnt add anything but frustration if you are running a decent manabase the rng shouldnt be the deciding factor in games like this its frustrating to lose to it and its also no fun to win because your enemy got screwed or flooded it should be skill and deckbuilding that is deciding digital tcgs not randomness and ive lost too many times to utter randomness in this game to give it a thumbs up still its a decent and fair game most of the time and has probably the best rewards system of all the digital tcgs out there
early access reviewso i started playing this game about a week ago absolutely loved it its important to note that i usually hate battle royale games but not this game this game took emphasis on past tense all the things i hated about the battle royale genre and threw them out the window it was colorfull without being minecraft it wasnt a camping simulator and the rgn in this game was limited you were encouraged no required to fight if you wanted to have a good chance at winning the best weapons and equipment didnt randomly drop somewhere you had to craft them at a forge crafting them also required an ingame trophie you only got from killing another player this and the fact that you got a reward shards which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general whenver you killed another player made sure that people werent just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights because fights were encouraged and they were worth taking the risk people couldnt just drop somewhere far off loot everything and then camp that is until a few days ago ignoring every bit of community feedback the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out and unique and good and threw it out the window its the same rng infested camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now that every other battle royale game already is too you can find dozens of similar games now with the only difference between them and this game being that they are less colorfull and their developers probably dont ignore the feedback from their community unlike this game
early access reviewif youre tired of hearthstone and want something more challanging and less rng dependant this is the perfect game for you mtg players should feel right at home with this one one of the game designers is lsv
"early access reviewthis is really scary i mean itwarningit can cause epilepsy diarrhea eyebags and heart attackfirst of all i give my respect of the creator of this game you have created one of the most cutescary game in the steam its concept art is great you can feel its horror when playing it each level have its different structure and going further and further it gets harder and more scarier art i really tell you its amazing from cuteness to horrofiying 9210sound when going to a different room its sound effects changes i really like that 9710character voice i havent heared other character voice except the ghost girl well its pretty good 910horror eight thousand, nine hundred and ten medium rating popup only gets me scared well sometimes the chasers too gets me xdi really appreciate if you would add more chasers that would get you heart more pumping"
combat is stale classes are stale customization is alrightraids are stale community is full of kids repetitive and unrewarding at high levels bad combogear rarity is ed common is common uncommon is common rare is common epic is common legendary is common shadow is uncommon rainbow is uncommonthe only good thing is the building
early access reviewits like if magic and hearthstone had a baby and that baby grew up to be chuck norris but in ccg form you can actually build control decks in this game whithout being rich cough hearthstone cough magic the gathering1010
most of my playtime belongs to the downloadingpatching from the three times i have tried this game and everytime i find it substandard and dreary we must ignore the p2w for it was foretold in the prophecy
i loved this game until the last update now the game is broken clicking becomes litterally useless early game your powers once you unlock them are based on clicking power so also useless right from the start since clikcing is already trivial when you get those some upgrades are buggued ingame bonusses are now so rare and worthless you dont even want to pay attention to the game anymore to get those the developpers took a great entertaining and addicting game and made it a frustrating and anoying game until they fix this if they do fix it i do not recommend the game to anyone
early access reviewobviously with reading the reveiws you can see that freejam took a good game and ruined it to make it a terrible badly made paytowin game its true but its free whadaya expect if it costed money theyd make no money they dont deserve being on steam
take a name associated with the most faithful adaptations of dd rules to pc games throw out all the customization that made those great and youre left with this buttonmashing moneygrabbing hacknslash mmo piece of garbage
early access reviewthis game is fun with a very supporting community online its one of the few games where it actually takes a long time and dedication to get the many powerful weapons so farming for items will be one of your main points into getting stronger in the game this game is great but sometimes its hard to discern if the items youre using is actually affecting the enemy because the stat differenes arent that large dealt eighty nine damage to an enemy with a weapon with fifteen attack did the same amount of damage with a weapon with around twenty nine attack overall i found this game pretty fun
i doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try team fortress two especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag but i suppose i should throw my two cents in anyway team fortress two is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play you get nine classes to toy with each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle then as you play youll come across weapons that let you experiment within each classs playstyle the more you play the more stuff you amass and the more options youll have at your disposal if you havent already take a dip into the world of team fortress two youre almost guaranteed to find something you like
early access revieweternal sits in between magic the gathering and hearthstone it could use some polishing but im sure the team is on it this game can be huge if the devs keep improving it i highly recommend it
ive allot of hours logged into this game and roughly almost every dragon in this game theres pros can cons of this game for one it costs money to unlock areas and get better items and dragons unless youve at least three boulder dragons for stable quests near titan level its almost impossible to raise gems without real life cash getting involved as well the membership for this game isnt worth the buy whatsoever dont pay for membership for this game ever for three thousand and sixty one can easily buy the whole game via area buy with gems and a couple dragon egg chests as well while the membership costs around ten monthly and theres at the moment no way of canceling your membership with a one click system so itll continue to take money off even if you dont want it too unless you create a forum page and actually spend the time to write back and forth to a admin isnt a admin for the game but just gives the info to another admin so it literally takes about a week to cancel a membership a normal kid will have no idea how to do this in my honest opinion2nd the game is cpu intense instead of gpu intense theres no way to change the graphic settings theyre perma locked at one setting and your cpu will do almost everything for the game instead of say your dedicated graphics card3rd glitches upon glitches in the 125hrs ive played this game ive gotten locked out of my main viking at least three times for several weeks and i had to go though forum admins and normal admins several times to get back into the viking and at one point no one in the world could age up a dragon because there was a huge no age glitch unless you used gems to age them it was impossible and it wasnt fixed for a two week time period and theres tons of more glitches in this game that arent noticable tell they effect your gameplay for example the telescope glitch that wont let one click on the telecope on the ice island that hasnt been fixed in around a yr so then youve to do around twenty quests to be able to finish it and click on the telescope in berk to finish the quest on the ice island i dont recommend this game for children for these reasons i only played it for so long because i love how to train your dragon so much and own all the books and tv series and movies
robocraft was once a really fun game however the devs have taken so many of the most fun parts of the game out that its just a huge grind dont play robocraft the devs will always take the best part out edit if i lose connection in game why cant i rejoin i didnt lose internet connection just my connection to the server and when i regained connection there was no way for me to rejoin
when you have 21k hours nearly one thousand usd spent on a game youd assume when an issue prevents you from logging in the support team would handle it quickly its been two weeks since my support ticket has been open and its still not resloved trion is known for their poor support system now i know first hand
early access reviewwell here i am this was my favorite game played for hours a day and thought about it through school now i hate clicking the play button this went from great to meh to burn it with fire i must say i was happy when the game updated but then when the release came out for new items it would be a to bloody expensive b the high teir pros can only get it and dont even get started on the economy way back then it was great smooth economy things can be affordable with twenty five battles and getting good was at the good point where its hard and takes work but then when you get their you feel rewarded now the lower teirs must be facedesking themselves with how greedy these people are what happens every update it feels like the prices grew higher and the money earned went down or didnt go as high as the prices did i spent weeks trying to get threeeee mega hovers weeks weeks for ccrying out loud weeks to make it a challenge said the mods such a challenge to get them it took me a shorter time to get through t7 the hardest teir for me to get through than to get three bloody mega hovers back to updates it was easy to get into updates and other things related to robocraft new update coming soon yay i would think as it went on and on it was new update with new weapons and a new map first time in for a new map in a looonnnggg time what was i like meh very unexcited removing ernable cash from battles without selling was robocraft shooting itself in the leg thats bleeding like hell from the other times it shot itself in the leg and never fixed it i liked the crates idea at first but when i saw that the upper row requires premium to get those items i had a brain fart another thing to add onto the list of greedy things freejam has done holy i never knew how much nerfing freejam would do to weapons that werent one of the newer weapons newer weapons such as the missile launcher anti air proton launcher and things that came after that to make it not any longer i just want to say this game was once good but now it has gone down the drain i feel like it can no longer be saved i guess it cant be saved goodbye robocraft our times once were fun and enjoyable billybobjoe
early access reviewif planetside two and warthunder had a love child in space this would be it really fun its already really good even at this stage of development needs a ship modifier mode though where you can add more gun or armor or something that makes your ship stands out and stronger cant wait to play the full game where its less laggy and smoother d
the game is okay i guess its good yeah sure but the game itself has no color no life looks so dead boring and colorless two hours into it i feel so tired alreadydoesnt happen to mmorpgs i like try it and see for yourself if you like it then good for you if not well yeah i feel ya again its a good game but it feels so lifeless so i had to drop it ill give it a 610cheers
early access revieweveryone who says it has malware is a dumbass and if seeding is a problem for you not only can it be disabled with one click youre a the game itself is wonderful and a blast to play the gunplay is great and the mechanics are nice it has vehicles and the bunny shoes are hilarious fun i dont know at how anyone could not like this game unless youre not a fan of battle royales
best way to play this is to look straight to the ground and take off headphones except when doing the audio cue puzzles game is okay gets actually spooky around the one hundredth room its an okay game
when i first started playing this game which i found by accident i thought it was a bit too annoying for my taste but once you start remembering all the parts for individual weapons you feel some sort of accomplishment when you correctly complete a gun with seventy parts without mistakes within a certain time if you get this game its free so why wouldnt you you will need to take into account that you cannot expect to complete this overnight unless you pay thirty for the full unlocks you could complete three or four weapons within the first day but after that the exp costs of weapons starts to rise and as repeating games nets you only ten of the exp you will have to count on gaining most exp through quizs every two hours and daily rewards some bad things about this game would be you require ten friends who play to unlock shooting ranges invite five friends who dont play and get them to play the game for an achievement and exp and thats really it
great concept great game and great gameplay one concern which is evident as many players probably know already is that the games playerbase is rapidly declining as off now huge large scale battles are scarce and seldom quite saddens me as i remember when i played it long ago these were common
early access reviewbabys first world of warcraft no but seriously this would make my twelve year old self very happy im nineteen now im never happy anymore recommend only if youre ok with this game still being in beta or youre still a teenager but if youre never happy anymore you wont enjoy it ill still give it a recommend to the younger playerbase
just as good as i remember the original being huge open worlds and battles full of hundreds of players its the only true mmo fps that i can think of at the moment lot of vehicles ground and air along with ground troops in open battle is an amazing experience its quite difficult when you begin youll be thrown into battle with hundreds of players both experienced players and those just starting out you will die a lot just dont get discouraged continuing playing stick with large groups and youll slowly get the hang of the mass warfare
only had this game for two days but really enjoying it the tutorial does a very good job of leading you through the controls and how to play the game and the three starter ships you begin with are no less capable than any of the other ships they just have roles which make them easier to play detection capable scout used in tutorial a fast attack ship and a support ship with healing aoe pulse and ability to break enemy armour all the ships in game are able to be obtained without spending real money and the rate at which you can earn them seems pretty quick there are multiple ships at relatively low cost across a range of roles including a very tanky battleship a medic ship with healing beams a cloaky ambusher etc the ships for the more complex roles will take a bit of time to work towards but thats probably a good thing as it means by the time you can buy one youve probably worked out how it could be used
this game has got to have one of the worst tutorial modes i have experienced so far i have been doing the tutorial and campaigns for two hours now and i still dont know how many of the mechanics work the tutorial itself feels thrown together and not planned out the story they try to tell you sounds boring and i personally would have preferred the game to not tell you any of those pictured stories at all or at least provide proper narration since the voice acting cant even remotely compare to that of hearthstone instead of telling you straight up what the actual battle phases are and what you can or can not do they make you go through the trouble of only being able to use the highlighted cards even though you can play other cards in the actual game mode sometimes you are allowed to play cards before attacking sometimes you are not but they wont tell you why that is the individual card skills are not explained properly and i personally struggle a lot because the voiceover itself is in english while i am forced to play the game with german subsflavour texts as there is no option of using english only or german only neither in the game settings nor in the steam settings this makes any sort of immersion into the game extremely difficult the language settings thing is more of a complaint towards steam though and not so much to eternal as i have the same problems when playing the witcher and some other games i do hope that they will release the english language pack for other countries though anyways i have played hearthstone since beta and enjoyed it until a year ago when i quit because of the greedy blizzard ecosystem where you either pay up or play mindless aggro decks i also used to play lots of yugioh and some mtg when i was little and some gwent after i quit hearthstone yet i am still having trouble with the eternal rulesets because of their badly thought out tutorial system i decided that i will give it another two hours or so of playtime and see if the experience changes somewhat or stays the same i must say so far i am rather disappointed i get that the game itself is supposed to offer more depth than hearthstone while not being as deep as mtg but shouldnt they at least have given you a smooth start into the game instead of forcing you to play only highlighted card for an hour while barely explaining the mechanics or at least which mechanic triggers first so far i am everything else but impressed with the game it has some good core mechanics but somehow feels way too rushed out like they needed another month or two to polish it up properly
early access reviewfinally eternal card game is the game wizards of the coast should have created ten years ago had wizards created an accessible attractive and intuitive occg based on mtg they would be the dominant player in the market going on a decade now however their shortsightedness and unwillingness to experiment with their ip means we had to wait for eternal to scratch our magic itch hex while a beautiful and intricate game lacks the accessible and intuitive aspects that hearthstone and eternal meet the gameplay in eternal is rocksolid taking core ccg mechanics and tying them to colors similar to mtg currently the colors are not as stratified as mtg which allows for more versatile single color decks while offering expanded options for multicolored decks eternal after my ten hours of play or so so take it with a grain of salt seems less focused on defining the metagame itself unlike hearthstone and to some extent mtg where the meta minus minor tweaking is established within days of a new set coming out largely by the developer this is for two reasons the core mechanics introduced in hearthstone expansions are usually the most efficient jades singlecopy bombs like reno and kazakus etc and the limited card pool simply doesnt allow much experimentation although im just starting with eternal it appears that there is a decent range of creature removal larger creatures and the like in each color along with some strong but not forced themes like echo and voidplay while eternal has a mana mechanic it is automated this means the game sets your mana curve for you limiting your optimal mana ratios however i assume they did it to remove complexity from deckbuilding which is a good thing when trying to bring in more casual players the game offers a plethora of manafixing cards as well in both colorless and colored cards to allow better control of your manaflow so far ive only been manahosed on a couple of occasions in most games mana has tended to be plentiful often to the point of excess as my early games tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient decks eternal thankfully does away with the tiny card packs of hearthstone and hex and has twelve cards per pack very close to the fourteen minus the land in a mtg pack at 1pack not counting the ability to draft guantlet or forge for free cardsdust the pack sizevalue ratio is exceptional compared to hex mtgo and hearthstone currently the game modes available are gauntlet forge ranked and draft as someone who likes to play mostly solo as i build a collection the game modes are very close to perfect gauntlet is a free pve constructed tournament mode and can be used to grind gold and some usually common or uncommon cards with a perfect 7win record earning a card pack as well the ai modes seem welldesigned to offer players good rewards as the player base could probably not accommodate pvp in each forge is eternals arena a sealeddeck format where you build a deck from random sets of three cards again the game assigns your mana it appears though ive only played once but did get a perfect seven wins that once you have chosen two colors of cards all remaining picks are of those two colors this is a very nice feature and prevents someone from getting pretty far offtrack into five colors though i am certain there are some who would actually like that arenas cost twentyfive hundreds gold to enter the 7win run earned me thirtyfive hundreds gold a couple of cards and four card packs so a little more than thirty one value you are allowed two losses before your run ends as you are playing an ai it seems this mode offers a pretty fair chance to hit seven wins if you are good at sealed in ccgs if the decks the ai is playing dont get more challenging as you rank up in forge it should be pretty easy to go infinite ive only played a few games of ranked just enough to get a win for a quest as i doubt im prepared to face constructed decks quite yet the mode works fine and even with only about 2k players online at any time the matchmaking only took a little longer than hearthstones the casual mode is currently offline i am guessing until a larger player base means it wont cause extended queue times i havent drafted yet but i will update my review when i do overall eternal is a great entry to the crowded online ccg market and outside of hearthstone might be the one to succeed with players who want something a little deeper than blizzards game the nitpicks i have with the game are minor i think the art looks a little small on the play table and im on a twenty seven monitor though it is fine when zoomed in as a onceuponatime competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness i prefer a hearthstonestyle consistently building mana pool however its not a gamebreaker and i havent noticed it being as much of a problem as i had in my ptqqualifier days if you are a magic player that wants deeper mechanics but still slickedup hearthstonestyle experience eternal is your game
early access reviewdustforce truly is a work of art i dont mean that lightly the way its animated plus its music gives it that title in my book i can find myself playing one level for an hour maybe even hours at a time the frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music the way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing they had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key and you would use that key to earn more levels in laymans terms to earn more levels you had to perfect current levels they ditched that and added an xp system in which you gain more xp to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect im very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it but now that i did buy it i do not regret it even for a second one thing i really love about this game is how you dont have to unlock base levels in a sense this game is open world that sense is that many levels are available to you and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels or stay where youre at to get an s in completion you have to sweep up every leaf and to get an s in finesse you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level another thing i absolutely enjoy about dustforce is its expasive community there are lots of community workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on and lots of people who can set a good example im sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a youtube channel so you can probably catch them there the community may or not be active but it sure is good and friendly overall in terms of gameplay music artstyle animation and difficulty its not an easy game but its not that hard of a game either it just depends on how much you want to play it i rate this game 1010buy this game
school of dragons resembles something of kingsisle entertainments creations wizards101 or something of the sort so if youre familiar with games such as that you can expect this to be quite the same the game appears to attempt to tell its own story your story whilst still adhering to the story of the original movie the graphics and playermobility of the game are subpar although the map layout is phenomenal the game isnt as bad as other reviews might suggest its a free game so theres no harm in surveying it i dont see myself playing this game for an extended period of time as it is not my cup of tea regardless of that the player count for this game is phenomenal for the amount of negative reviews this game has undertaken
well made but like every other clicker game it gets boring after a while it depends on how you like those kinda games i like games kinda like cookie clickers but in other terms this game wasnt for me but other wise its a great game if you dont like crafting clicking type of games
its really insulting for there to be a premium subscription system in this game and heres why starts off innocent enough right you pay your five bucks and start playing and level up your heroat the end of the month your subscription ends what happens to that hero progression you commited hours to does it vanish does all that hard work need a monthly renewal to be retained after you level up if it doesnt vanish what happens on the flip side remember that one time you played that one randomed hero you dont ever usually play and leveled him to a really really low rank the meta will change and maybe youll pick that hero more and more in the future but now whenever you replay him people will see that lowly rank forever after the subscription expires youll get flamed shamed and pressured into renewing a subscription just so you can validate yourself as a dota player valve understands its toxic community i have no doubt theyre trying to leverage the harassment that will surely ensue in pubs whether you dont have a pass or didnt renew it why do i need to pay to validate to others that i am a good dota player all of these new features could have easily come standard to everyone all of this plus i can see a future now where theyll lock further and further content behind this paywall everything from now on will be locked to people who choose to play for free the games population has reached its peak now theyre holding us in with a subscription system that well need to commit to with our wallets i protest this system with my wallet i will never again buy a compendium again cash cow of a game and theyre still not satisfied gabe youre getting too fat you cant see the players who used to respect you and grovel at your feet over your triple chin and mountainous belly anymore
way too many botters and cheaters you ban people for using cheats that you catch but what about all those people obviously chat spamming at the nexus i watched people in the wilderness shoot thru walls clip thru walls and otherwise break the rules yet none of them have been banned yet i think the development team needs to take a look at this notorious oryxrape client and learn how to defend against it to anyone thinking of playing save yourself the time and download something else this will just test your patience and reveal how mad you truly are on the inside maybe thats how its supposed to work my rating 110the game concept is cool but they need to refactor nearly everything especially the part where you need to pay real money to pretty much do anything because you will never get there legit being pushed out by botters and spammers and i cant wait for the responses saying oh well just mute the spammers gee thanks never thought of that there are more spammers in this game than any one person can count to in a lifetime so yeah not recommended
early access reviewif you are a huge fan of smash bros this game is for you its a fun amazing platformer game i usually dont play platformer games but this game has sucked me in i am a huge fan of this game and i love playing it it is based on skill there is no pay to win or pay to play at all its a fun amazing game
stay calm stay calm ohhh againthis game is just hardcore you have to level up to get stronger but if you die you have to start over again you have to be very careful in this game but on the other site you should get better weapons and armor so you can survive a lot easier later you have to farm some dungeons or mobs to get stat pots wich inrease your stats you can trade join guilds or cry because you lost another charakter it is realy challenging but a lot of fun if you are a patient person you can unlock a lot of classes and decide if you want to play a healer damage dealer or tank there are even classes which combine two of these roles you should totaly try it out if you like the retrolike graphic and roguelike shoot n dodge games
early access reviewi ve not played much of this game so its fair to say that i haven t been able to experience all the features however i already see the aspects of the game which need emphasising and the problems of this game the game is early access so it has the odd bugs a multicoloured polygon games springs to mind but this isn t something to get angry about in game before its official release the team working on this is small but the game is often updated as is the outlined plan and community engagement is fantastic from artix entertainment it was the nostalgia of my playing aq worlds almost ten years ago that drew me to this game it has some of the same charm and humour but not to the same extent at times the game can feel like its trying to hard to be what its predecessor was the big question when it comes to this game is whether trying to make the game accessible for mobile gamers had limited its appeal and enjoyment for pc gamers the answer in short is yes the camera feels clunky and the game very much feels like its designed for regular visits and clicking which could be done on a small screen the classic trope of mmos grinding quests are definitely frequent toward the point of tediousness some redesign is definitely needed in terms of quest placements and objectives my main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quests often quests are very small possibly to make it them completable on the move and so double the rewards for the remainder with a slight increase in difficulty i think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in terms of achievements rather than in gear the game doesn t feel like a life experience in the same way as other some mmos and rpgs including aq worlds does but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task thus the problem is that the game feels far too much like a classic mmo and not enough like the game it could be perhaps essentially what is needed is a slightly altered 3d version of the of artix s more successful 2d games another problem is the crafting system when you collect enough raw material npc crafting shops can make this into gear for a price this is quite basic and nothing i really have a problem with the issue lies in the need to wait a set about of time a minute an hour a day etc in order to collect your new gear it slows the game and when you collect the item it can sometimes be that it no longer feels worth the time as you ve levelled up and found new equipment to use the question that i think it comes down to asking yourself is whether it is better to invest your time in a game middevelopment or a game in what is essentially the dlc phase should you play adventurequest 3d or aq worlds for me getting back into the latter is very daunting with so much content one of the reasons i often avoid mmos is because i feel so out of my depth when compared to players who have been around for so much longer the 3d game is lacking but it has fantastic potential and will hopefully grew into the game it could be it s worth taking the time to try this game before dismissing it especially for people who played artix games some years ago
hirez are killing another game most of the competent devs have been moved to paladins and weve been left with people who just want to milk the game for cash without fixing any of the problems they flood the game with subpar skins in endless rng paytoget chests lootboxes and dont fix the bugs ive been playing since the closed beta and this is such a shame
early access reviewthis game came out of nowhere for me i hadnt seen or heard a jot about it before the recent steam sale overall very much enjoying it the space battles are just the ebst lots of depth too especially considering its just an alpha overall a cracking game excited to for the full release
old dota was fun the new hud and the game play is just terrible it seems like they are designing it for the steam machine but it is just brutal now the notifications stack on top of eachother so you have no clue what is going on in the game its hell trying to view your teammates inventory or your opponents its just bad now im also uninstalling
its super fun and cross platform between pc mac android and ios which is an awesome way to get your friends to join in the fun its easier to pick up than card games like magic but has very detailed mechanics making it fun to collect and master
game for the warhammer 40k event left cause of how much play time id have to put in to play with the warhammer tanks im talking days and or spending like one hundred bucks to just get them what a scam
early access reviewthey still have a long long way to go before i would consider this a playable game everything seems to be held together with duct tape its very clunky you cannot adjust any settings and the gunplay feels like more fortnite than pubg which is sad and awkward when its graphically so similar to pubg the biggest reason im uninstalling it right now however is because of the cancer known as gaijin being installed on my pc without my permission absolutely unacceptable borderline criminal
early access reviewi have been with robocraft for quite a while and honestly i do not like the direction they are going it used to be a great build and bash that was pretty balanced but it seems like over the updates the balance has gone away pay to win is the name of this game with the recent update no more money from winning matches just random loot crates that you only get half of if you are not a premium user while they do drop free premium every once in a while its not keeping me attached to this game anymore i dont think its worth too much more of my time unless some changes are made
meh this game is basically an afk game thank god its free even the time i have spent coming back to it just to level up characters and get to other stages feels as if i have just wasted parts of my life
if you played andor play the normal yugioh card game i do not recommend this its a sad immitation dont get me wrong its oddly enjoyable i mean i put in six hours into it and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then thirty minutes but its not something i can take seriously cons first they cut the game in half which means half the deck size half the hp half the time and half the cards on the field biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that so that means you have cards the ask for five thousands hp and combo cards like exodia that are useless the game forces you through a progression system that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction i understand explaining a game to someone but anything bellow level forty is no challenge at all and thats with a half deck to give example of how bad it is level twenty and bellow are so easy i can win with no hp loss and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long the ai is super simple now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage six to even play against players just to clarify what i mean by no challenge is the enemy does not place spell or trap and nothing above crappy regular three stars which can be easily out done with one of your first cards last thing i have to say is that the game reminds me a of sterotypical chinese knockoff they put in a attempt tried to cut corners and it turned out like prosyes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it matches are fast so you can enjoy a few during a break its more portable so yugioh on the go less money to get a insane amount of cards good way to try new cards and card combos they implement a autoduel feature making the boring duels shorter more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck voice actors from the anime
early access review free amazing game and i never had any problem on it until now allot of weapons and characters actually there is something i love it in this game that you dont have to pay money mean charge real money for it you can play and level up your account without money and you can buy skins and more weapon if you want but that will not make you stronger something else this game have new gameplay new technic something different on it last thing that made me impressed they respect players reports and suggestions finally i really recommend this game for everyone try it and see what im talking about
are you stupid why would you be so greedy and kill the dam game makes me sick i have like two hundred and thirtyseven hours in to this game but will uninstall and will never play again im suck of trion you ruin every game you touch because of greed im not alone i know lots of players that uninstalled cuz of this hope your happy greedyhttps youtu beenynq1mziwshttps youtu beh0fv51whbq
early access reviewthis is a game where you spam leftright click you should not have a fuing matchmaking system full of fuing tryhards overall iz a gud game just fix ur matchmakingâ â â â â
game first released for mob in 2014best game for mobile yet m playing this game for two yrs now and still i think this game is doing too good since its released first on mob back in 2014i recommend to play on mobile if u have one
early access reviewthis game is actually quite a bit of fun i had previously played both faeria and hearthstone so the game play in ecg took a couple games to get used to but it has been well worth it i highly recommend playing this game if you enjoy games of this type
it is fun and truly free to play you cannot buy an advantage you can only buy appearance buying new playable characters is not necessary you can simply get them by playing the game and earning in game currency
why in practise mode do you have significantly decreased economy and why are there cooldowns to increase it and also why are you nerfing the meta towers to make them bad and not usable killing a bfg has become almost impossible and so even if the game was balanced it would be exessively boring and nobody would want to play it the whole community is saying to the devs to fix the game and theyre doing the exact opposite of what the community wants meaning everybody stops playing the game because its a waste of time please dont get this game its horrible
okay very good moba really like it but theres always a but not like in butt like in but so like i said but please add set id be really happy if you did it note that maybe its only me that thinks so but not like in butt for f sake dirty minded people no but for real please add set and his ultimate should be when he transforms into a huge serpentine thatd be cool right itd boost his damage his speed and his hp making him a tanky god right please note this
imagine going to a clothing store and giving the employees fifty dollars and saying give me a hat than taking said hat putting it on and then signing up for the military two years later you have been ranked up to a private first class you go out to your one hundred mission with your hat and a lighter then you set the hat on fire instead of taking your gun out you run to the enemys base with the flaming hat and say i will trade you this hat for your car keys then you are shot and die and thats the game
access reviewthis was one of the best battle royale games i have seen i would love to recommend it but their privacy policy states that they collect data and im like oh okay probaly just your system hardware and time spent playing however the more i read the more strange it got like i know cheating breaks and ruins the game but come on thats just overkill why would you need to know my antivirus or my network connections its acting like some kinda trojain or something please dont get this until they make some major changes to there policy link to policy https www ringofelysiumonline comwebprivacy htm
early access reviewwhat a great game but i feel as if it is incomplete us fans were told about hurricane gameplay and several modes all we get in the end is a 6map linear shooter with a limited user interface it seems as if middevelopment the creators of the game said nah its good enough and left which sucks because it a really fun and addicting game i would say its a six hundred and ten rating but only if you can get past the limited graphics and limited user interface great game but can be improved
early access reviewhowdyan exceedingly simple game with a very linear path without any means for devating too simple for a regular gamer too complex for a brand newyoung gamer to figure out what they must do in order to advance the linear story
early access reviewgood mechanics somewhere between hearthstone plus and m tg lite very generous f2p implementation good fun without screwing the pooch for monetization highly recommended if youre looking for a digital ccg
a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming this sequel to a genredefiner that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre great graphics amazing sound and voice design and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make dota two great but its major strong point is the depth in its mechanics while dota 2s gameplay might seem daunting at first its one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting other games such as league of legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula but dota two kept it intact and makes sure you learn something new everyday not only the core game is strong but also the esport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing with several tournaments going on including valves own the international at the time of release the game looks like a train with no brakes about to crash against its competitors and run them over raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game
its freetoplay and definitely has some paytowin qualities but if youre a casual player and dont care about being l33t its quite fun and free lots of dd lore especially if youve played any of the recent dd encounters adventures rules are based on fourth edition which is my favorite edition so far ive played dozens of hours before it came to steam leveled a cleric to sixty and have a couple lowerlevel alts i only paid once to get the founders pack deal when it first came out in beta theres definitely dozens of hours of free entertainment here no iap necessary get a group of friends together and play it for fun pve and its totally free
neat the game has been released time for another review tdlr normal people don t bother but if you re a masochist this is a game for you the game punishes you at every step of the way for playing the game they do this by requiring you to level everything you own in order to unlock better flatout straight up better equipment and weapons it gets worse they go further by requiring you to pay upkeep costs for your weapons the mods on your weapons and the ammo you fire modded weapons are required and become unreasonably expensive to maintain however if you pay premium you may use them without any draw backs weapons themselves are expensive and nearly impossible to obtain unless you pay money or put in hundreds of hours to grind out the required levels what would otherwise be a decent wwii game is weighed down and ruined by this unfair and unfun progression system thank you for reading all this
excellent game allows for accurate gameplay with low graphics settings plus its free so anybody who is unable to afford a high performance computer can enjoy this gaming just as much one thousand and ten
this is what an arpg should be a company that puts its products and customers ahead of the bottom line thats unthinkable in this day and age i am always the first to loathe microtransactions but even i had to admit this is worth it and threw some coins to ggg its amazing to see how much depth and gameplay is here after being a victim of the gradual dumbing down of bli over the past few years the first character i made was a pretty big mistake and i started over its actually awesome to be able to make good and bad choices what a nice change of pace so i really recommend this one to everybody my only regret is that i never really gave this game much of a chance before now and before i forget this is one of the only games that i actually leave the music playing in its incredible
early access reviewit takes a super long time to join a match and half the time when its says connecting it will just throw you back to the lobby the movements are abit laggy but other than that good game
i know my steam play time is low but ive been playing this game for a solid amount of time before this released here and i love it so much this is from someone who hated mobas and everything about them but i was a bit curious and thought that smite seemed like a good entry point and since then this has been the only game i consistently play the gods are all so cool and the mythology adds a fun layer with the characters plus actually seeing the skins you have on your god is pretty great the motd is a fun addition because it spices things up a little if you dont want to play a traditional game mode which smite has a solid amount of the daily log in bonus is great because i havent spent a penny on this game and i have a bunch of gods and skins and ward skins and icons if youre someone who doesnt like mobas i would suggest you give this one a try because it might just click for you that all being said it seems the steam version might be a bit iffy right now so you may want to wait and download it from hi rez either way i hope you play this game
this is the closest digital replacement to mtg youll find including the mana system that can sometimes frustrate those who dont understand why its there its very good and quite friendly for newbies and people like me who dont want to spend money daily quests and free modes like the gauntlet give you enough golddust to build your collection quickly im completely f2p and after a few months am at the point where i can build top tier decks or easily grind the needed dust for them in a few days my only gripe is that im still so bad at draft lolupdate i finally managed to hit draft master
early access reviewthe game had a rough start as there were a ton of players rushing into the game and the result was a large waiting queue and multiple restarts on the servers fast forward five days and server stability is much better and the game is a lot more fun now the combat system is very unique allowing for a cascade of different combos to choose from and a ton of customization where the chances of even the same class being played exactly the same is very slim i played wow a lot and this game has a better feel for sure i chose the seventy dollar pack and i enjoy the perks that come with it
in my opinion its the best action rpg thats on the market right now it has a grim setting and a story thats mostly told through environmental bits of lore but most importantly it has a depth of gameplay that no other arpg comes even close to its the best spiritual successor to diablo ii to date the first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed there is a web with hundreds of choices dont worry eventually it will make sense you can obtain respect points via quests and item drops so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear the gems have one of three colours redbluegreen that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear sockets can be linked allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems this can do things such as splitting your burning arrow into four projectiles or turning your glacial hammer attack into an aoe attack that hurts monsters all around you later in the game you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage or get stunned every three months the devs launch a major patch with a new challenge league which adds new skills new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics the free to play model is truly free to play you can play all the content in the game without paying a dime the only way the game developers make money is by offering microtransactions in their store for cosmetic upgrades that dont affect gameplay want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor looks want your fireball to look like a dragon there is a microtransaction for that want a lizard with a bell on its back to follow you around like a puppy theres a microtransaction for thati have put hundreds of hours into the game using their native client because i started playing before the game was on steam and found buying the microtransactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more and more and more and more content to the game while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic microtransactions there are a few noncosmetic microtransactions available to upgrade your account with more character slots i believe the default is twelve so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the seven classes and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters the default you get is four which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in two thousand and thirteen but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in two thousand and sixteen there are also premium stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours the game is free so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game
early access reviewwhat do i like nothing the game stinks now removing the game and moving on to something else all good things must come to an end this good thing was kinda short lived but to each his own no building skill required anymore too many bad things to say not enough time to type them all down so long freejam ill be sure to stay away from anything else you do
hello im rikex and welcome to my reviev of this broken ing trash gamelets start off with something simple play ingstyle as you know dash was officialy introduced to the game since the beginning of this season and i am getting ing sick of it it completly broken the meta for agressive players like me thus blocking the rank ing up abilitywell maybe another thing maybe the weapons are balanced no they ing arent guess what per every three or four ing matches i encounter you know what the most broken and op weapon in the game since the dash update and nerfs n buffs ing bow well there are some weapons to counter it like uhh blasters right no they counter of this bow besides bow maybe other weapons are fair and balanced in some way no cuz guess what scythe it should go and knock the down in one direction not ing nairing and ing her to the bottom of the ing mapat least scythe is counterable but by what katars well the weapon is actually balanced in some way but can be cancerous with its easy silver combosokay but if you are very good you can rank up with every weapon right no you cant because guess ing what lots of money that ive spent during my brawlhalla game time went for ing nothing i at least except the servers to work but no you rikex we know that you spent lots of money buying in our game but you and the servers mamooth games first time rikex being disconnected from ranked game causing a tragic eloup twenty seventeens colorized well if you and your friends simply look for nice game to beat the out of each other for boring days i greatly recommend the game but if you want to rank up and be the no1 you mammoth games
latest updates turned planes into a freaking joke capped roll controls capped pitch controls automatic zeroing of controls at this point its not a plane anymore its a god damnned flying car wouldnt recommend anymore they keep dumbing down the controls
early access reviewa bad magic clone full of all the same mistakes made by its antiquated predecessor mana floodscrew mid game dead draws due to useless excess mana cards in order to try and prevent the aforementioned its gorgeous to look at but it plays exactly like the game they cloned to make it and with the devs deviding their time between this and the equally clunky hearthstone cashin called elder scrolls legends neither game gets updates nearly quickly or reliably enough and neither game has anything truly unique to offer
early access reviewsubmitted a ticket to support a week ago asking to get my character restored since it was deleted from the account sent in three different tickets and have heard nothing back at all i didnt duplicate items exploit bugs nothing support team has disappointed me to the point of asking for a refund
neuf classes distinctes vont vous fournir des possibilités tactiques et des personnalités diverses mises à jour permanentes avec de nouveaux modes équipements et surtout des chapeaux
fun to play for a while really enjoyed it played a lot of ai to practice and played mostly arena there are certainly issues with the game for instance how long it takes to unlock the gods without buying the thirty god pack but the one really terrible aspect was the matchmaking i had very few close matches and if i won a match the next time i played no one seemed to have a clue it was as if the game saw you win a couple and stacked a team against you to make you lose it got to the point where i really have trouble wanting to log in to a match it was very similar to paladins too many one sided matches too many times the teams should have been mixed up you can tell when one team has borders high fantasy points higher god levels against a team full of level one gods with the basic default everything feels pointless and demoralizing maybe hi rez doesnt care about anything but esports or they dont know how to match people of similar skill dont know but i stopped playing paladins because of it and i am most likely going to stop playing smite there are better games that have developement teams dedicated to gameplay rather than just esports and cash shops dont mind the cash shops and the cool skins but when you play six matches in a day and get stomped each time you cant get enough points to get the cool stuff most losses came from playing with people who had no clue how the game worked didnt buy items ran in and died everytime or could not follow up anything soooo i would recommend trying the game out but dont spend any money unless its a game you really really feel your gonna be dedicated even when matchmaking sucks the soul out of you as for me ive had much more frequent fun close games with overwatch dota2 and lol
"if you thoroughly enjoy mobile games dont read this review tldr this game is either a mobile port or designed to be like one enough said i go into nitpicky opinionated details further in the review this game is not what i expected unfortunately this game is much worse than i expected i saw this on the new releases section of the store homepage and instantly thought you know the last time i played yugioh was in sixth grade id like to try it again oh boy this was a slap in the face to me a teenager wanting to tap into my nostalgia of this card game that i loved when i was one thousand, one hundred and twelve the first thing i noticed was that the game which is rendered in a 720p window had two sidebars blocked off with the yugioh duel link logo printed on it the only part of the screen you actually do things in is the center portion that has the dimensions of a phone in portrait mode for me it is beyond difficult to get through the tutorial battle because i can barely navigate through such a joke of a gui it was then that i realized this game was either a mobile port or for some stupid reason designed to be played like a mobile game no just no you dont put a mobile game of a beloved franchise and put it on steam if you want to put a yugioh game on steam just make one intended for pc mac and linux that has no trace of mobile concepts like that gems bs or the actual functioning resolution being limited to a phone screen also the recommended specs of this game are complete bs an i5 and gtx nine hundred and seventy for this honestly if you have a gtx nine hundred and seventy this is not the game to use its horsepower on i strongly recommend that if you have any sort of dislike for mobile games or a desire to play a good yugioh game on a desktop platform try to suffer through the lack of content on steam and look for something else online also the main starting screen in the park area looks similar to the one from the bakugan ds game if anybody here ever played that"
early access reviewmonth after month there will be updates to worsen the game from its original glory do not give these people your money you will regret it within the month this game was once thoughprovoking and fun any dumbdumb with enough cash could be the best at this game now disgusting is the direction this game constantly goes beware
my funny story about my first time on this game my friend told me to join hes world so i did we played for like a few hours and i learned a lot i started farming cragwood logs windows and other blocks to make my house detailed and goodlooking till it went nighttime on the game i realised that i couldnt see without torches lights i placed down a few torches in my wooden house and it looked pretty cooluntil my house which i spended two hours on burned down we arent friends anymore
product received for freeearly access reviewgame has gone to after the new epic failure update i will stop playing and advise that the community stops too so that they revert the epic loot update this has been the worst since the removal of mega bots as the rise of the megabots update was one of my played the game far before steam enrolled it since june twenty thirteens actually
at last a grand sphinx will teach you to respectcower in fear of my lord of the lost lands enough of your vandalism you have awakened us this will now be your tombha ha pretty much sums up the game
warning highly addictivea very fun and well presented rts harkng back to the golden age of games done well even better you can play this fun time consumer totally free it doesnt try to nickle and dime you at every stage it lets you know where to get any rmt boost if you so desire without ramming it down your throat no bad points really so at a stretch sometimes not very often you click a character and it sends them to a random room above or below the one they are in easily solved by replacing them in the original room
unbelievablefunny game at first so much i invested a little nothing much but still i had to reinstall my machine all backups worked but the vaults from this game gone and with them time and money the nice thing was that noone isfeels responsible for this game steam links to betheda and their page is useless and to it they dont even have a real support it seems after twenty min i havent found a way to actually open a ticket on their page so thanks for nothingcareful with this
early access reviewbought this game second time but still this game is unplayable after finishing training when i enter in town very first time fps drop constantly game not even let me choose 1920x1080 maximize window doesnt help i read so many positive things from dev but sorry to admit i might come to wrong placewrong game in year twenty eighteens tabtarget is worst decision may be i come for third time if they change tabtarget option sorry abt bad review watching others video and actually playing is different things i followed some streamers opinion and bought this game another time again my worst decision
early access reviewthis game is grind simulator and communist propaganda bought sturmgewehr fortyfour for 208k and all i got was russian players killing me with their tula tokarev basic weapon from crappy factory in siberia this game deserves no attention and should be left to die in some dark abyss
early access reviewi had to change my review from negative to positive the computer does cheat but only after you go on a hot streak and win quite a few free packs then the a i just does what it wants and you will lose but im ok with that as long as it doesnt always cheat im fine with the house needing to come out ahead sometimes even if its unfair this game is a hell of a lot of fun for both singleplayer and multi if even a little bit of you loves tcgs look no further this has it all and for the record i did support this game by purchasing all the campaigns and two full boxes of cards its a great free game but it absolutely is worthy of supporting it to keep it going this was my original post i have changed how i feel and updated above game was fun until they recently upgraded the a i to cheat like crazy during any singleplayer modes the developers must have got tired of people doing well in forge and gauntlet so now i regularly lose way before completeing either due to ridiculous draws by the computer scrounging for twentyfive hundreds gold only to lose 2x on the first match of forge has happened way too much since they changed things oh well it was fun while it lasted
early access reviewseriously amazing game pubg totally accurate battlegrounds need to learn a thing about optimisation this games is aesthetically pleasing to look at and runs smoothly its quirky and has its own niche obviously this game has alot to work on thus having alot of potential e g oce servers please a party system and more customisable settings for example there are some bugs but they arent worth mentioning i support this game one hundred good job developers download it while its free
early access reviewthis is a great game but whenever you unlock somthing new you have two options grind for ten hours or spend a around eight to get the item you want it is quite sad to see such a good game go to waste because of the fact that it gets boring only being able to play with two weapons if you are not into grinding for ages like most people i hope the devs sort this out because i love this game but the hole system spoils it
early access reviewway more polished than pubg also free the main thing to know is what differences it has compared to other games in the genre you get a starting loadout and there are actual spawn points you choose your spawn during the the one minute setup and you can see where other players are spawning as well the spawns are well spaced out this coupled with the starting equipment means that the start of the game is less insane than other br games you never feel like youre taken out before you have a chance to play even in the inevitable city frenzies everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kicks offthe travesal equipment is the most unique thing about this game with each loadout you get a gun a piece of equipment medkit extra ammo ect and a mobility item you have a choice between hang glider snowboard and climbing kit with the hanglider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you were going snowboard allows you to move at vehicle speeds on any downward slope finally the climbing gear allows you to climb at special places on the map that other players would have to take the long way around the climbing gear isnt really as fun but they counter that by starting you with a shotgunfinally you are not fighting till the last manteam standing you are trying to board a chopper with only four seats however most of the time it still turns into a last manteam standing game but the fact that if you can create enough chaos you might be able to climb that ladder without being blasted adds a bit of spice to the end game
early access reviewoh how i loved this game i remember how good it was back in the day when it had the tech tree and no bull that is now known as the double skills or something like that when you can shoot in too modes with one weapon i hated the update where they removed the tech tree but now with the crates this has become another one of those cs tf2 crate luck games so i think i wont be playing this game any time soon i will probably come to check it once in a while to see if theyve listened to their old players peace
spent hours trying to get into the game stuck on loading screen eighty tried everything nothing work cant even play the game btw i wanted to play the d game but nothing works and i tried everything on youtube and w e people suggested
personally i think this game is very bad the graphics are really bad i think they have made other better versions of this game that cost money those i think might be better but dont waste your time downloading this game its not worth it
early access reviewyea real good game spent about fifty dollars on skins and weapons except now i cant even play the game because it only blacks screens and no one has a fix for it
cute terror my this thing scared the living daylight out of satan himself true story seriously im a fan of the horror genre and this has lived to my expectations one thousands might sound like a lot but when youre running to save yo from the i dont know what the hell was behind me man rooms go by fast a true gem
when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed as my first arts moba game it was pretty complicated i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying before i knew it i was performing better and better i stopped making silly mistakes and i got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team for the most part everyone ive met was very helpful and nice there have sometimes the jerk however as i continue to play dota2 more and more im sure ill continue to improve i recommend this game for all yes i used google translate you can kill me now
to start off lets do a quick summary of what elsword is elsword is a anime styled side scrolling free to play classbased rpg fighter in which you are given the choice of nine different characters to fight with level up and evolve so to say each character has different skill trees which can be chosen to fit your personal gameplay style like to play as a free knight and acquire pyromancer abilities choose elesis like being a tank for your team choose chung how about being an archer to attack from long range choose rena this selection of characters is great for all kinds of players and helps broaden the audience for this game it has typical elements which you can expect from an rpg armour special weapons potions grinding etc these elements fit well into the world of elsword helping you defeat bosses in dungeons to earn xp and gain better armour and weaponsspeaking of bosses there may be repetition with such bosses as banthus but besides that they are both challenging and rewarding the game itself seems to get very addicting when you are trying to level up your character and get them to their next form or evolution as ive said before the stamina bar is used to prevent addiction this bar is gradually used up as you complete dungeons and once you are out of stamina you cannot do any more dungeons for the day stamina is refilled every day though as well as having unlimited stamina at weekends so all you fanatics can play to your hearts content in closing i believe elsword is a fun vibrant and addicting game and i recommend it to all of you anime or rpg lovers
early access revieweternal is a very generous collectible cardgame if you want a great free to play experience in a ccg eternal is the place to go building the best decks is completely doable if you put in some effort even the campaigns can be bought with ingame currency that can be earned through any gamemode playing experience eternal is complex enough to keep a lot of players occupied for a long time the pace of the games feel comfortable quickly and good balancing keeps metas interesting there seems to always be more then one metadeck this game feels far from stale competitively different decks come out on top every time whilst rng doesnt have to much impact to be annoying all in all this is a captivating highly enjoyable and highly addictive game id recommend it to anybody who likes a challenge
warning play this game you might curse sometimes the developers have done a good job in making war thunder a reasonably realistic mmo wargame lately i have been playing the tanks and can report to you that the key to knocking out an enemy tank is to kill all of its crew as opposed to the tank having hitpoints as it is in the other major mmo tank game this game may take a little bit to get used to but once you do it can be addictive fun i believe war thunder deserves at least one award for its hard work including research and development in bringing the nearlyforgotten war machines to life
early access reviewso my friends and i bought the game to have fun with and imediatly it was clear that there was a skill gap so i went to try ranked out and i was playing scarlet and i was then swiftly and easily destroyed by a hattori who then after the game said spam much and called me a one thousand and ten would get evicerated and mocked again
early access reviewnot much fun has wacky armor and thats all that it has if you are looking for a battle royale alternative this is not it the controls are like trying to steer someone through syrup
early access reviewgreat game it always has you running paniced and confused it makes the horror experience complete with jumpscares and a confusing but compelling story mystery you just cant pull away from this game
early access reviewreally good game unlike ninety of battle royal games it actually brings something original and new to the table obviously its in development and isnt perfect a few bugs and glitches here and there but nothing too serious the only issues i really have are the hitboxes not gonna lie theyre kinda bad and please make it to where when you just cant go into places you cant fit when youre prone instead of it having you stand up ive been killed several times because of this
"this game will make you quit and delete it in a few games as you play the blance of this game is just no where to be seen and the grind is just one of the main problem it makes you think the boosters will help but it wont do to much and before the grind got screwed up their used to be a opiton to just buy the weapons or vechiles without talking a long time even other games such as world of tanks or war thunder could let you get it right off the bat this game surely needs a reboot because this game anit going far its only makes other wwii games much better than this sure it dose have good maps and nice graphics but it dosent cover the rage and pain to deal throught a game my word for it never get it untill theirs three good reviews in a row on it and if not just dont get it will save your lifetime and for the people who have this game heres a note never give a single penny to this game it wont do you much now and also if you do play it go for german its the only team that can win with its rediculos unbalnce team updated to add this on since its been a while i will admit this they got the idea and the feel of whats its like in the war the guns and weapons are well detailed and the hard work of the people who did this much on the visual of the game is great but since i havent played it in a while my bets its not much changed maybe half grind but the balance of the game is still a mystery overall give it a shot at least if you want but dont give a penny to them because if we stop giving them the cash maybe they will finally fix some of the major problems in this game but anywho take care you guys and fight on in the war updated one hundred and eleven thousand, one hundred and sixteen since its veterans day i thought playing this game would do it but it really didnt for whats new going on about this just gettign worse and this whole game might abandon ship they got ride of bikes and the old trucks from the spawn point witch really is sad because thats the simple way to go to one place or another and not have to be forced to buy a truck repairs in this game is just more sad because paying that much your lossing about twenty one thousand coins in that game for just that one weapon still no since of balence of guns or ranks grind is still not great and the game balence of when their three enemy planes and your team has none idk who did there reserch but surely they didnt had much logic of having something little balence in the game buying gold is just pathic just have it at simple numbers like four hundred and ninety nine or nine hundred and ninety nine its that easy maybe they need to get a buck more to survie but surely this game is still have no single thing of redemtion in it for just something simple have the game or balence of ranks teams and guns dont charged alot of paying or repairing weapons and at least have some respect of whats the purpose of the game this game has places where battle acutally happen and all over 70million lives lost in the war total weaither its axis allies or even citizens you really need to know whats it just like being in their shoes so this game works but still not even if you want to try it go ahead but dont donate to them if there going to screw you over in the future a suggestion of another game would be post scriptum as it has no pay to win alot more balanced and a bit more content in my opinion as its still early game but its more playable than hg"
early access reviewi was getting back to this game a couple of times and at each time it was different not worse because i could still build my robots in peace now its gone last and final attempt was when maximum loadout update came in i dont say it was bad to be honest it gave a player a possibility to efficiently fight against all kind of robots but thing that finally made me think bad about this game is rp nerf fj agreed it was too rough and fixed it hah dont make me laugh you re looking at one hundred and forty hours for 2x megalegs and 6x megalasers rp price reductions and timetobuyso i would need to play 25x more hours that i played to get it its about fortythree two hundred zero rp about fiftytwo k rp for battle as an average player before fix i took for good tdm one hundred and fifty k two hundred k rp which wasnt much now for same battle i take fifteen k for great one with most kills and damage twenty five k at lvl ninetyeight with 25k robotthis is a mockery after nerf and fix most of players still get ten of rp what they get ealier fj ruined the greatest thing about this game an abillity to build everything what you can imagine without worring about money you are making a tank but miss one smg to finish here play twenty three hours to get it if devs wanna keep that fix they better should do something with matchmaking the most expensive parts are only thing that will keep u alive in battle and deal real damage without them you will be crushed at first encounter with enemy tl drgrind all evening to get one good part
planetside two is not a regular fps its kind of like a big battlefield map but bigger there are no rounds and intermissions it feels like youre waging real war like in war its unfair it promotes teamplay and sooner or later you will want to join an outfit a guild in mmorpg terms to fight alongside teammates if you like mmorpgs and bigscale fpses and are okay with things being unfair once in a while i can wholeheartedly recommend planetside two if you expect superfastpaced fights sick killstreaks and xx420scopezzmlgxx clans please stay with call of duty
i have been an avid bethesda game fan since oblivion putting hundreds of hours into both oblivion and skyrim played all of the dlc roleplayed dozens of characters and beat both of the games several times i have no idea what is going on with bethesda as a company but it seems like at this point they are taking advantage of their fan bases trying to squeeze as much money out of the franchise as possible and killing the life it has i was disappointed to hear about tes six not being developed for the next decade or so or the fact that they created a creation club and the fact that they released skyrim on about a dozen platforms but this game you have to pay to play this game you literally have to buy the acts to actually play the game this is a mobile game they make revenue off of ads already i found this game fun but i dont want to touch it anymore just for the simple fact that you have to purchase acts that dont even last that long there is no real content that you are purchasing what are they charging you for p s to bethesdaplease stop ruining my favorite franchise with your money grabbing greed i wouldve spent more money on my own accord purchasing packs but simply wont touch this game again because you are forcing me to dish out money for you you used to be my favorite gaming studio i used to day dream about working at bethesda but now i cringe at the thought of your studio and the shell of itself it used to be
this game is awesome it is a thirdperson rpg with hundreds of missions and an ingame speaker so you can talk to your friends and the people your playing with other features include mounts companions healing devices multiperson dungons and lots more you can buy ingame cash but its best to stick to playing it without emptying your wallet because it gets so adictive that you could not have any more to spend on other games i highly recommend this
ive put some time into this game and i enjoyed it a lot as a casual player however ive recently been running into a bug issue that has caused my game to freeze and crash and ive tried everything to try and fix this lowered my graphics settings verified folder integrity uninstalled and re installed contaced hirez which has the saddest support team they contacted me back in a about a day said my case would be transfered to the proper department and nothing i even responded to the email to check in which is said to do and still nothing its a shame really the money and time ive put into this game and they cant help me with a issue im having i keep getting negetive hits and got a you will be banned warning due to the fact that the game keeps crashing constantly too afraid to even try and play a match due to the fact i might get banned but even if i dont it still sucks because its like im banned anyways because i cant play its pretty i cant recommend a game that has such horrible support for its players
this is a promising new idle game with a lot more strtaegy and unique objectives than the competition the downside is that progress can slow down a lot after a while since some planned features seem to be missing its a bit too reliant on rng and it eats up a lot more memory than it probably should but hopefully those issues will get ironed out over time
the game itself is fun well made and is worth a look at but requiring the player to pay real money for all equipment makes it unfun unfair and unrecommended i can see a membership being something better maybe premium items like custom skins but requiring real money for everything even the default itemsspare equipment drops my score greatly graphics 87100audio 78100playability 83100heavy minus on microtransactions regulating the entire game end total four hundred and ten
while writting this review ive over one thousand hours played several characters with max lvl and finished all end game content the good pretty good and enjoyable combat system pretty much the reason i still play it decent graphics option for free two play players to get almost everything from the real cash shop though its hard and time consuming decent events and promotions once in a while includes pvp events hourly activity event system this is one of the best things which can happen to mmo it pretty much helps to reduce queue times and give some bonus rewards to the playersthe bad this game had few heavy curreny exploits which totaly ruined the econmy lots of the exploited currency was not removed and impact this game to this day many exploiters were not banned and run in best in slot items without any penalty real money means very little unless you can spend several thousand of on a game basically if you would want to get full bis gear youd need like 2k of real bugs take months to get fixed if they even bother to fix them in the first place lots of overpowered items which come from lockboxes sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like dota two several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags very poor class balance extremely poor pvp balance for example you can move your best in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min lvl required i think i dont have to explain how much impact it have even at max lvl pvp theres insane gear gap between players refiling system pretty much pay to win feature it makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lots of real to get nearly bis or bis gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops this game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players if this doesnt change in near future it will be the reason why this game dies
early access reviewgame has a great base but horrible balancing dove is a griefers dream being unable to fight your own faction for elite spawns makes you want to rip your hair out new nerfs to every class took the fun out of pvp duping bug destroyed the economy and will never be punished spent too much money on this game for the terrible infrastructure and dishonesty from the developers this game is not worth spending your time or money on the game has become increasingly more and more controversial by the day and for good reason i tried to give it time and let them work the kinks out its very clear that it is becoming worse as time goes on rather than better if you can get your money back and pull out before its too late sadly it probably is for me
proslooks fineishcharacter creation is awesome conscombat system is is not excisting gtx one thousand and eighty barely sixty dps in small camps not even 30constant phasing makes parties split you cant really play with friend might be only at the begining it has potantial but it need a lot of work
i have more than 2k hours of playing this game now with a high elo in some gamemodes like arena and assault and how do i get rewarded for those achievements i get paired with people who dont even have fifty hours of gameplay against a team of balanced players you see because i have a high elo hirezs algorithm thinks that if i get paired with people with low elo my elo will balance it out to a regular match so i go positive or almost in all my games almost always top dmg and still cant win because i get at least a lvl twenty feeder every match the worst part is that when you try to give tips to those people on how to get better they get really defensive and toxic this really really ruined the game to the point that its completely unplayable for me its been a problem for years but recently its been the worst its ever been for me
early access reviewfirst i would like to say not to pay attention to all those idiots who say this game is pay2win now that is really stupid did you honestly expect the developers to keep on pulling money out of their asses you still have one world in creativerse to do with whatever you like i dont see how that is a problem at all considering the costs for maintaining hundreds of worlds from just one player is ridiculous creativerse pro gets the developers more money to make more awesome updates for the game in my opinion this game is awesome you can make cornerstones to make a blueprint out of so you can get a house up without thinking of a really neat design for a house night mobs are quite difficult to start with but arent so difficult as you progress through the game which i find to be a you can claim your own territory and dictate what settings are avaliable in your territory which is really nice
a great game to enjoy with friends if you enjoy battlefield call of duty or any other generic fps then this is the game for you dont expect to enjoy the game if youre in it for kdr though because this game isnt about kdr and you will get frustrated if that is all you focus on if you want to make certsthe ingame currency then you should play medic medic will net you your weight in certs faster and easier than any other class i came back and played this again recently and dear god they may have improved some features but some weapons just wow theyve nerfed so many things into the ground back when i played there was an lmg that was specific to the vanu its called the lasher now back then the weapon was good it did decent aoe damage on impact to force people back from doorways and if you direct hit you could go toe to toe with another heavy it was considered garbage even at that point in the game but i liked it because if you could land your hits you could out dps peoplebut only if you could land all of them the lasher is in the trash now the aoe the thing the weapon was designed for is practically gone both damage wise and range wise many other weapons share the same fate it makes me wonder wtf the developers are doing every weapon that isnt just a plain jane of its class sort of blows but i came back to look at the construction update and all the others ive missed since two thousand and thirteen the game has some nice new features sunderers the mobile apc spawnpoints can have cloaking fields not sure how i feel about them taking more than two c4 to blow up now thoughif they have a special armor type i used to be a pilot but seeing all the changes im not touching that with a ten foot pole the rest of the gameplay is relatively the same it takes a while to get decent at the game and once you do thats it the platoons and outfits dont communicate a whole lot the games only saving grace from becoming an endless shooterwhich is fine if youre into that but im not should be the community but nobody talks theres ingame voice chat but nobody likes casual conversation it seems that the only people playing are in it for the certsthings you spend to unlock equipment now if you do find a good group of people to play with its a fun game if you dont youre going to get bored really quickly im not sure if id recommend this
early access reviewso far ive played through the tutorial missions to unlock each deck i can already see im going to be dumping loads of hours into the game as a big card game player already mtg hearthstone duelyst and shadowverse i can say that the mechanics in this game while borrowed really flourish with mechanics that make sense the only gripe i have is some effects on cards arent explained in detail when you scroll over it it seems to only give a basic definition of what keywords are some cards have non keyworded words on them that you would need to go look up to know
i like the game played way to much of it xd im nearing on three hundred hours at the time of this post if your competitive its defintely a good place to be every once and a while they release new characters and weapons which helps to keep the game fresh
worst free to play game i ever saw if you want invest two hundred you can enjoy this hardcore walking simulator seriouslyeven a concentration camp is more enjoyable than this game
you want to get rid of your social life you want to throw your money against a wall for stupid effects you want to play with russians you are still reading this then download thisâ â â â â â 1010try not to become aâ â â â â â who has over five hundred games with sniper
cool game to play with your friends its chilling but still lots of bugs that shouldnt be in the game like timer stuck people not moving people teleporting and lots of times only one person of the game is lucky all others have to pay positive review when most of the bugs dissappeard
awesome gamesim great graphics i can even run this max settings on a amd pc no problems with prettyness to optimisation crank that graphics setting up other than that the driving is great the physics isnt to great when hitting stuff other than that great def give a try also for ftp it has a great selection of cars and tracks not alot but i mean its ftp tbh i expected alot less would recommend this atleast try b4 you knock it one thousand and ten ign
i have decided to get back into realm once again through the webclient version and it is a very exciting game so i have decided to come back from my extremely old review with no reason to recommend and have completely reworked and rewritten the reviewwith constant imaginative enemies fighting you ranging from cute but deadly bunnies to oryx the mad god himself this game is a bullet hell and god damn is it a crazy bullet hell missiles flying in every direction imaginable enemies releasing missiles in every direction adds the challenge to rotmg as you really have to learn how to use the controls effectively before being able to imagine the higher levels but those higher levels are extremely rewarding if you reach so it is absolutely worth the time doing dungeons there is a natural annoyance with the business model it has very expensive packages being sold which can be bought with the in game payed currency gold or just money with just the beginner package being sold for twenty for a new account and sixty after however none of the packages in rotmg actually need to be bought you can achieve the same as anyone else without paying it is harder yes but it isnt like its quicker if you pay its just easier if you do overall i would recommend this game from the point of view that it is f2p so youre not wasting anything by buying it
now this is an incredible game challenging in further difficulties and very personalised to your specific build most freetoplay games are not worth thirty hours of your time this will give you satisfaction for months at the least those of you who remember diablo two will love it it has very many similarities and is far superior to the simplistics of diablo three in my opinion this is the diablo three we all truely wanted
infestation the newzbefore you read i would like to say that i have over three hundred hours on this game before steam release infestation the newz is an official rework of the original and bad title infestation survivor stores formerly known as the warz the newz is being worked on by a whole new development team called fredaikis ab there is not a single dev from the original iss on this development team everyone knows the warz and how bad the game was it was riddled with hackers it was seriously pay to win loot was rare so it made hackers even more populated it was full of bugs that devs did not patch and lets be honest there was no content all there was to do is pvp now on the other hand fredaikis ab the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did they are listening to the community and trying their best to make a game that you guys want they have released an anticheat called mlg anticheat this anticheat was designed just for this game i have over three hundred hours before steam and i have only got cheated once i repeat once due to the lack of content the previous game had they made about ten different pvp server maps so you can hop into it and pvp right away they made a custom br they added airdrops these drop about every hour on official servers they have revamped the ui they have added alot of guns that the original iss did not have and armorhelmets etc and they added skins three traders dream they have completely removed the pay two win aspect of the game now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market they have not removed gc gold credits you can use this to purchase a private server to loot or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place this is just to support this game and keep it alive some of you guys need to understand they need to have a few things they can make money off of a game is not free they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that ten thousand people are playing on
early access reviewpeopel will compare this to pubg or say its a copy but people are just not used to have fun this game is very comic i like the gameplay so much i am very bad and pubg and fortnite but in cuisine royale i can actually have fun it feels like everybody around you has the same skills as you i like wwii design and weapons and i specially like the use of kitchen stuff as armor cant wait for future updates this game has alote to give
early access reviewoverall a pretty standard battle royal game towards the pubg side i did enjoy it and the character creator is probably the best part about it the animations and game play actually reminds me of the division just slower and less bugs gunplay is lackluster though
new client is awesome i love the looks and feel of the game once the kinks are ironed out this gonna be way better than the crappy ugly old client game still is addictive and fun and best of all legitimately f2p
liked tf2 until the competetive updateit destroyed casual you cant switch teams i prefer to be in team bluthe autobalance is gone and because of that there are so unbalanced teams you cant even think of four minutes loosing in cart game then you have to wait so long to get onto a server also you cant search a server anymore like you could before why the heck did you touched casual valve reallytf2 was better before the competetive t
"early access reviewfun to mess around in but at the end of the day it doesnt require skill and you have to buy either ak four thousand, seven hundred and twelve or the blazer which are the best rifles and sniper"
i am an avid hunter in northern arizona this game makes me feel like i am actually hunting that nice big mule deer but the game is not free to play when you get it you are only allowed to hunt mule deer and rabbit in only one area of the game if you want to hunt other animals you have to pay for licenses and the weapons to hunt those animals to advertise a game like this as a free to play is wrong it should be advertised as a free to win game as the only way to get that big whitetail moose or elk is to buy a membership then spend cash for coins to buy bigger and better guns i recommend the game if you like great graphics and the feeling of outdoors but not as a hunting game buy one of cabelas games everything is included and you dont have to spend over twenty thousand to get great stuff
im getting tired of clicker games on steam but i cant get that get on the way its a good clicker at least it shows something different formation tactics so not bad but to game developers and steam itself we are getting tired of clickers
early access reviewstep one downloadstep two launchstep three create a new worldstep four wander aroundstep five make a taming bellstep six tame emallstep seven be a pokemon maste i mean be a creativerse tamer1010 would catch emall
this game looks awesome and its free free is never truly free but that is the marketing model this game will continue to develope for years to come this game has come a long way since two thousand and nine thats right two thousand and nine its been reworked alot of times and its always getting better this is one of the most fair free to play models in the market each track takes hundreds of hours of work some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it nearly every game out today sells dlc this base game is free you forty to sixty ahead just for trying it if you like it then get what you like if not at least you did not blow forty to sixty for a game you only play once in a while the cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want there are packs available to save you some money you will probably spend sixty to eighty for the content you want if you like the game all the content is about two hundred and fifty or so i used this on my fanatec wheel and my x360 controller both play well at this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim i have played including ac when ac first came out it had this beat now with a few updates later it is better both graphically and in terms of physics i only wish the game had daytona road course i have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam about two thousand and nines or so this game really does continue to get developed
early access reviewthis game actually pulled me away from hearthstone i love the synergy of the different mechanics the flexibility of the deckbuilding and the creative modes and challenges i highly recommend this game to any fans of heartstone or magic the gathering if you keep finding you want more out of your ccg eternal really strikes a great balance between accessibility and depth while providing plenty of generous rewards glhfsee you in the draftsedit i forgot to mention how friendly all of the players ive met have been the community is very welcoming and happy to help new players or discuss strategy
tldr this game is fun it isnt pay2win in any kind of wayive read some negative review and had to say something about the p2w aspect it is not pay2win you have to buy better towers and their upgrades with ingame currency which is awarded by winning games you pay to a special amount of coins to play a game if you win you get two times as much back you start with zero coins and by winning seven games you get a ranking in the worldregion ladders where reaching different ranks awards a good amount of coins every wednesday so if you start playing sunday you get how the game works on monday win a few games on thusday and get the coins on wednesday you have gone from zero to one thousand coins in three days and max thirty winsafter this you could get worlds first in your second week of playing even in the first week because its play2winon another note you need to win games to unlock the purchase of better towers and their upgrades so once more you need to play to get betteralso if you dont want to waste your money dont spend any i had about twentyfive thousand coins after my first week which is about one hundred in reallife
playing since two thousand and eights and still my favorite go to shootemup ive made real life friends and had more laughs than i can count i still play rather vanilla but enjoy that the community can and has played such a big part in developing items and creating a wild economy within the game
early access reviewi did not think i was going to like this game i would reccomend this game very spooky but god damn those ing chase parts get me jumpscares eh not so much but the ing chases those suck it goes on through like thirty rooms and then of course they are all ghosts so you gotta move fast to get ahead of them but they go through the damn walls im on room one hundred saved taking a break i dont think that was wine1337420 so far
early access reviewits free magic the gathering online and it kinda owns earning cards is so much easier than most free card games out there the game hands you a tooon of to play with deck building is more interesting than a certain card game that limits you to thirty cards and thirty cards only you can make a deck of just about any size depending on the game mode so long as your deck consists of one third power mana cards
glitchy bug when trying to go to full screen mode all i get is a black screen tried to uninstall the game to revert it back to normal settings still in full screen and black would be a decent game if i could play it
"tl dr great game being tarnished by bad development practices fpeparts debacle as of late is a good example of itto start this game is fantastic currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat and shipshelicopters entering closed beta testing no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone arcade for casuals and realistic battles for more hardcore playersengine is utterly fantastic for any game moreso a f2p game absolutely amazing performance on any system can almost run on your microwave while having great graphics on the highest settings only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the config file but its pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally isnt neccesary i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is in my opinion one of the best f2p games on the market but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others even if i continue to play the game why because gaijinthey have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle such as the ru251 they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with ge purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection fp which parts are needed to repair your tank after its damaged which happens alot and fp is needed to put out fires these parts can each take fifty thousand, one hundred battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for gameplay and grinding were mentioned and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind this video then unsurprisingly received 5k downvotes versus 1k upvotes comment section filled with people calling out gaijin and saying partsfp should be free and not ground out for then anywhere it removing the grind for partsfp on a gaijin operated platform the discussion is censored this partsfp isnt the first nor last time gaijin perform a practice like this i can not recommend people who havent played this game to do so you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into gameplay hampered by greedy practicesif gaijin ever turn this around starting by somehow reducingremoving the partsfp grind then i will change the reccomendation to a yes"
horrid support sketchy missile dynamics they ban people who show broken parts of the planes or the game itself they updated steam regional prices which made it more expensive than normal currency exchange rate and when there is a problem between steam and dcs what they suggest is stop using steam why do you release it on steam if you are going to give no support for steam users im definitely not going to buy stuff out of their sketchy website which you get no support whatsoever dont mind my game hour as ive been forced to play it from standalone
lets start with the fact that well having a dragon doesnt really opne the doors if you know what i mean you might be able to fly but whats the point if there arent a lot of things to do with your dragon that have a meaningimpact or are fun the second thing is that there are a lot of paywalls the chances are that you wont really hold to the game for a long time as most of the content new or old will need the use of your wallet another thing is the fact that there arent really a lot of interesting quests that give you some sense of accomplishment or are fun it feels like if youre doing all of this just to waste your time which might not be bad if you want a timewaster as far as i know there are such playersand lets not even talk about the bugs to put it simply its a buggy mess with not a lot of reasons to play it and on top of that is also made to be milked as well
early access reviewonly started playing yesterday but ive already put in quite a few hours this game rocks visually stunning graphics varied gameplay that requires skill and tactical planning and a great nonpaytowin set up all adds up to a great game and its still early access i cant wait to see what the final game looks like
early access reviewhave an older computer that just meets their minimum requirements dont get this game have a less than perfect internet connection or use wifi dont get this game bottom line is this game not only has poor server connectivity requiring a players connection to be just so to avoid being disconnected from battles each disconnect counts against you too many and you get slapped with a five minute penelty the penelty is fair enough to discourage rage quitters but does not reset if you dont play for an extended period of time so if you dont play for a few months and got disconnected enough to gain a penelty you still have to wait five mintues only to see that servers will still kick you from games for having a less than optimum system
there are almost no restrictions on how far the enemy can go to your spawn and then they can camp your spawn and you cant do anything to win the game and they make new people fight pros before the games was so good and very adictive and it was easy to grind for money and xp but now its almost impossible to get new weapons and new careers the devs realy need to listen to the people to make the game a lot more fun for the people and not to make it so unfair and they should stop banning people who have bought stuff for hackingcheating just so the peson gets a new acount and buys more stuff but me my self have not experienced this but there are very many people saying that it has happend to them and i have only have been ginding for the money and the xp another thing is that people can camp the trucks for people who spawn and the devs are not doing sht about it and its to unfair for people ive already said this but they realy need to make it so that new people are up against other new people or atlest a little more experience in the game but not all of them because then the enemy will have automatic guns and your team all have starter guns one more thing i forgot to say sometimes people are supper bad at the game and get your entire team to loose with stupid ideas
early access reviewgreat combat the rest is a massive dumpster fire slap on the wrist for dupers nothing said about having fourteen the content is jp version had patches that have not been tested and make no sense pushed on live servers class balance is atrocious i could go on save your money and dont buy it edit duper bans already over with most of them keeping everything lolololol
early access reviewwould not recommend it installs malwaregaijin agent that you cannot remove easilyit is essentially malware it installs without being given permission to do so cannot be uninstalled from programsfeatures embeds itself in multiple separate locations reactivates itself even if you manually deactivate it reinstalls itself if you delete it oh and it acts as a torrent seeder for other people updating the game thus using your bandwidth so that gaijin can get their client updated for freeonly way to permanently remove it is to delete it uninstall warthunder go to regedit and delete all registry entries pointing at gaijin net agent
early access reviewhello this is my review of robocraft i am very expirenced in this game i have over two thousands hours p yes for a while i did forget about a life i have been playing since twenty fourteens near launch back then it was a very fun game and no p2w at all yes their was grinding but not as much now i personally prefer the old system for money it was better than haveing to grind for crappy crates i think things went downhill after the meta update the crates got added they changed alot of stuff and messed up the game and such but as you can see much of the community has the same views as me so im going to have to say no to this game but as always it is up to you if you like the game
access reviewthis game is great and i love to play it but there is one thing that keeps me up at night and i cant ing understand it it makes no sense and it ruins the immersiveness completely almost breaks the game when i think about it because it destroys the foundations the game was built on spoiler alert if you read what is below you will never see this game the same way who takes the picture for the news of the chopper escaping dione with the last survivors i dont know but it keeps me up at night
despite the constant stating that tf2 is a dead game i highly disagree yes the comminity is not as lively as it used to be but this masterpiece is still kicking after ten years i plan on playing it for a very long time
had this on my phone when i was waiting for fo4 its simple fun and good time killer alot of new struff has been added such as quests etc etc feels odd playing on pc but it opens the game up to some things dits worth a try but if u have a habit of spending money on mobile games stay away it makes this game sooo easy and they made damn sure u will want to spend money redonkuless amounts too i am atm playing a money free run and its not a problem at all keep in mind if u spend loads of or some money on your vault and start a new one its gon all of it u will not get what u spent money on over to a new vault
early access reviewi need to get this rant out first then ill talk what i like and disliked i played this game like crazy i wont type out all that i loved about the old robocraft as i wont put a deep feeling of nostalgia to me and of hardcore fans so here it is robocraft is dead to me now it has lost all of its appeal to me a year or so ago i played this nonstop i enjoyed it to the point where i would wake up five in the morning just to play this now hah no they put a ing crate system in this game wth i dont want that in any game and they also screw with the physics to the point where vtols are no longer possible why why freejam get rid of those and put back the level systemok now that i got that out of the way ill tell you what i adored about this game2014 i saw this in my recommended games looked at it read the description and what i saw was that they put minecraft and robots together that description did no justice to the game those precious years ago you would have somewhat incredibly intense games in the higher tiers trust me in this before they threw out the leveling system it was adrenaline inducing three years later hey guys we decided to f up the game even more by adding crateswhy just why we early hardcore robocraft fans understand where i am coming from it really makes me sad to see this game ripped away from me i am torn between giving this a jab in the face or one hundred hours meaning i really really really really want to give this game a thumbs up but now i just cant they messed things up when a lot of us hardcore fans said no please dont mess with it like that when a friend told me that there isnt really a tier thing meaning that any level can play any level and that any level can use any itm tore me in loving memory the old robocraft 20142016ish years freejam if you guys read this change it back it was much better then honestly it was a lot better with tier separation and level requirements please put the level cpu back i cant give this game a thumbs up now im sorry
just an overview really id score this seven hundred and ten i have this on ipad too pros well fleshed out progression system will literally last you forever no need for microtransactions if you dont want them syncs with kongregate cloud enabling cross device playcons literally no sound at all anywhere super repetative can be boring as in the beginning not a lot going on on the screen difficult to see when things have updated
one of the best games ever released on steam in the past decade one thousand and ten this game combines what everyone loves in gaming strategy and fun with it being free this is a steal i highly recommend checking out one of the most famous franchises in gaming if youre a true gamer with a passion youll defintely need to play this gem
"early access reviewyou can go back through the timeline to say which game copied who people say this is a fortnite clone but h1z1 came out before fortnite so is fortnite a h1z1 clone this logic can go back to the beginning of video game time theres no harm in variety of a genre review assuming you and someone else has equal aim skill it comes down to who has the better armor weapon rarity however you can double dash as a warrior in their face to keep them on their toes teleport through windows as an assassin for faster looting dash straight up in the air mid shotgun fight as an engineer to confuse them or run midfight as a mage with her limited flight ability once youre out of health youve become your worst nightmare a target for spinning sword attacks however you and your fellow chickens cant swarm in from the heavens like ocarina of time youll have to hide like a sneakyboi pubg style the chicken doesnt make much noise standing still if youve waited out that timer congrats now youneed healing a fun extra ingame concept is the use of your mount if you get tired of dayz running in realm royale just hit that z or zed for all you canadian mighty morphin power rangers key to pull out roach now you can gallop around town with the horse you love you can use this to run from gunfights however that would be detrimental in improving your aim so if youre tired of the toxic trashtalking h1z1 wannabe nurse disrespectors out there the slithery snails of pubg sunbathing in the grass waiting for a prey to come by or eleven story themeparkmansions that people build in 4tnyt this might be a game to try out somehow overnight this does not want to open on my default monitor even though i have them duplicated while running this game i need this to work on my main monitor for reasons it just black screens though seven thousand, seven hundred and ten until i can get this issue fixed"
early access reviewit plays a lot like world of warships in space and i like the different roles of the ships and if you have a team that communicates well it is a great experience some ships feel very niche and not worth playing if your team just does whatever they want so team play is pretty essential it feels very mobaesque but would be nice if they added some more maps and maybe some sort of creepwave the good news is the developers seem to take player feedback into consideration tldr space ships go zoooooom pew pew pew and boom boom boom
early access reviewi enjoy the game a lot on days when my internet is stable and not too much broadband is being used you can play it with your friends meet new friends through friends etc its pretty neat and so far ive made quite a few new friends through it people id never thought id meet im sitting at about four hundred and thirty hours with probably around sixty spent on it skins are cool and possibly improved little skillwise but overral its fun doesnt require much system wise even my potato can run it and doesnt take too long to get used to p s dash sucks bring back chain dodging
early access review robocraft
i love this game but fair warning get only if you like learning and isnt bothered by reading manuals also a joystick is a requirement that said i always wanted to get shot down by an aim120 and this sim fulfills that need the dlcs may seem overpriced but theyre very well made and a ton of effort went into them
very dissapointing sim even after pouring in over three hundred dollars to the game i still could not get into it i could go in detail about all of the faults that the developers simply refuse to fix but it would take me a year verry buggy sim and clueless developers
this game is very deliberate butit causes dizzinessespecially for mewhen trying to assemble all parts the view changes again and again frequently and quickly after playing for thirty min i have to give up and the feeling is very uncomfotable vomitted after
early access reviewlets get the fact checking out of the way bless saw a original release in korea back in two thousand and eleven we dont know how long it was in development but the average development cycle for games is thirty five years it can be argued that bless is a ten year old game it runs on directx nine so that alone tells you its age it failed in the korean market it failed in the russian market and it failed in japan here we are with the north american release and the game is blowing up it seems to be a very successful release right now i cannot comprehend it are we so thirsty for a new mmo that we rush to anything thats called new like its a new flavor of icecream because this isnt at all new but its being marketed as new they want you to think its a early access game its notneowiz is lying to you they lied about the na veing a reborn version of bless we were told that bless combat would be more action orientated like black deset online what who thinks bless combat is like bdo absolutely no one i wont get into the whole idea that we americans have a severe whale mentality when it comes to games how we throw money at studios and developers left and right in the hope of satisfying some insatiable need for entertainment instead i will focus on the facts and the fact is this game bless online does nothing new seriously there is nothing innovative or new in this game if you were lucky enough to watch the various emissaries play bless on the japanese clientservers you would have seen a game very similar in playstyle to everquest you would have seen a very basic bare bones hotbutton smashing themepark orientated mmo with zero style or flourish absolutely nothing sets this game apart from games from the 90s like everquest or daoc in fact speaking of these older games they were done better thats saying somethingplease stop throwing money at this project i cant call it a game because its more of a business excersize at this point as they keep rereleasing it trying to make money we have to stop letting publishers and development teams treat us like idiots the na market wants a new mmo but neowiz isnt providing us a new mmo theyre providing us with their fourth time recycled trash again the na market is full of people wanting a new mmo but this isnt it look somewhere else
dcs was a rocky start for me but once i picked up a cheap joystick i got hooked ive racked up most of my hours from this summer alone everything from flaming cliffs three to the ka50 black shark and the classic a10 with so much more content on the way if you like military flight simulators this game is for you
business tour feels like an online multiplayer version of the classic board game monopoly pros free to play multiple settings for different types of games no gadgets quick 15min game and 2x2 teamscons in my experience winning 2x2 games seems very heavily dependent on which team rolls first i would like to see the rolls alternate ex blue red blue red rather than blue blue red red nonteam mode does not have an option to choose how many players you want per game one other person can join the lobby and press ready to make a two player match what if i want to play with three or four players gamebreaking glitches are very common ex player disconnects sometimes cause the game to freeze indefinitely leave game button not working getting randomly booted from games gadgets enable pay to win mode game is still very new and it can be hard to find a match especially in early mornings estedit along with the updates more bugs have been introduced even when you win the leave game button doesnt work dont waste your time on this game
this game is fun to play with friends but it is also gay and highly ing racisist i swear it favors one person on the board the random picking is horrible because not once did anyone land on my property the whole game the world championships thing is ing aids it needs to be nerfed all in all this game is ninety luck u cant be a half darkie and play this game
best hunting game on the market as of the writing of this review im gonna warn you though ive spent close to three hundred on this game so far and i still dont own every items or equipment if youre not willing to pay dont bother even downloading the game
early access reviewi always felt that korean mmos were far too gentle in their grind i always wanted to spend one hundred hours to build a simple top tier vehicle in a game let alone going for the big boy megabot and spend one thousand hours to build it 1010ignso grindy you cant have a life and do well its the ideal game
early access reviewi was very happy to see that i played for over 3hrs and was having so much fun that i didnt even notice has a nice challenge to it and nice pace love the storyline quests also
dreadnought is a really nice not to complicated game to play with friends playing on your own is a bit meh since theres a lot of nubtards playing dont expect any fleshed out story or cutscenes or anything pick a ship jump in a game and start blasting overall 45good its freesmooth gameplayeasy to learn hard to masterlots of customisation optionsbad graphics are a bit dissapointingwaiting times for matchmaking sometimes really long
i dont recommend this game anymore unless you enjoy becoming whale food incredibly paytowin p2w endgame pvp meta is stale matchmaking is terrible too many rng elements loot rewards monsters abilities devs seem more interested in pandering to whales and cashing in on new monsters rather than balancing existing monsters
early access reviewits literally still on its alpha phase whats with the harsh critique from some well it has still a lot of things to be fixed but i think its still quite playable it runs well with some pcs ive used as for the graphics i absolutely have no problem with it considering that i play the same games having the same gq it has still problems with the audio like it disappears when you alttab during the loading phase though still can be fixed by doing so again for now ill recommend this game in its alpha phase more testers may produce better outcome of the game take note may
early access reviewan online game that freely rewards you just for playing against ia always deserves a positive review ive played like one thousand and twelve hours on steam and maybe another two thousand and twenty five on my phone not much but im giving my point of view im a person who always expects a lot from a game if it doesnt fit my tastes then i quickly drop it after an intensive period of trial so first the negative points cons the collection is really extensive and the possibility to have in your deck four copies of a same card including legendaries makes me think this is not purely f2p the crafting system is unbalanced aswel you cant disenchant a premium card for half the cost of making that same nonpremium card just for those of us who enjoy a complete collection without glowing things please take that as an advice please developers turn one guys you forgot to make up for the player who starts second resource differences here are maybe not essential and the blocking system seems fair but still the first player can have two or even three units on board in the second turn while the second player has nothing this isnt a con the resource system can sometimes make you lose a game yes but hey thats why there are draw emblem cards to cycle and thin your deck and thats why the game itself forces you to include a thirty three of power cards in a deck the old general rule in any classic card game what happens in hearthstone when you have an awful start while your opponent has a very good one pros pretty much anything else animations and graphics card design controls rules atmosphere a cheap and challenging way to try your skills and decks out against ia and getting cards you can earn gold in gauntlet then spend it in forge free without having to play against experienced or p2w players a huge bunch of mechanics making a crazy deck is really fun although ninety times it can be garbage d lots of game modes that got me so if you want some kind of complexity and a huge collection to complete mixed with intuitive mechanics and amazing tutorials try the game at least its free an easy eight hundred and ten maybe more
i dont know where all this pay to win crap is coming from ive been playing for two days and not spent a penny or felt like i had too you get enough crystals in game to top up on cards without the costs and even if you d odecide to buy some cards you get crystals which get you other cards for free sooner the only gripe you could have is pay for cosmetics they cost you cash for pretty card sleevesmatssimple answeri s if you begrudge that dont buy them while there are plenty of in game expense traps none are vital to playing the game
man look at all them fake reviews trying to tell people that the game is at least decent unless ure a gigantic whale from the get go then sure its a tiny bit enjoyable otherwise its not help urself and just go
this has helped me through my stage eight terminal brain cancer i have finally seen how valuable human life is and how the afterlife is just a mere illusion through our own insecurties of death and how we may be forgotten a century after our death i have fully embraced the true meaning of life through this game in other words it has enriched and enlightened me as a whole because of me not just disregarding this as another weeb game i have accended to another philosophical plane this game has convinced me to empty out my bank account and go to a monastery in mongolia and become a monk my flight is in a week and after i write this review i will vow to myself to not use technology ever again so i can start being a monk in training thank you developers of sakura clicker
fun for a minute then its just repetitive if you want to work on a specific gun you have to go through every gun before it get xp and possibly pay for some crap dlc just go in wikipedia it better than this crap
the game overall is fun and the character customization is nice but the problem is the server which sometimes cant load a gamelike when youre on the loading screen the game will stop there and it will take you back to the waiting area with your teambut sometimes the game works and you can playfix the server and this game will be much better
this new update one hundred and twelve deploy drive wait for a respawn has unfortunately made this game suck for everyone the new damage update makes every vehicle a god at absorbing bullets and shellseven when destroying as many components as possible spawncamping is being encouraged now due to the maintenance timer only viable thing to do is run starter weapons if you get spawncamped the new driving physics makes cars go twenty kmh offroad while getting catapulted to 100kmh on roads you never want to touch your brake button as that activates some sort of airplane level brakes that kill all your speed in a second cornering is impossible due to you powersliding round a corner when holding the gas you just not making the turn when just steering or doing a grandma where you drive round the corner with no speed at all the sound is broken now aswell to the point where i cant pinpoint sounds anymore where before i could and oh the tank physics good luck getting up hillsmountains ive been actively playing the game for two years now and i really enjoyed it before this update too bad they had to release this update in this form it has great potential but in its current state it is unplayeable i dont recommend playing this game right now
its sad how the game went from being my favorite game on steam to being the most toxic game that i can name out there in just little over a year its easily noticeable how toxic the community is it used to be so supportive but now all you see are twelve year olds saying the same insults over and over again im pretty sure the devs know how bad the games current state is yet they fuel it with stupid taunts and extremely overpriced skins or constantly changing the metas i wish people still actually cared about this game more rather than trying to get elo in ranked
i played it once and it lost its magic you have to pay for more guns and after youve done one gun youve done them all its seems like a game that would be very cool but is very bland and they threw in the minigames to fix that but it didnt help at all fun at first but has no replay value
early access reviewrobocraft used to be my favorite free game on steam creative fun gameplay now though if you want to play robocraft you have to install a piece of third party software called easyanticheat to play as far as i can tell easyanticheat is a keylogger and a screencapper that periodically posts both screenshots and chat logs from the game with an accompanying username to a public database eac is flagged by most antivirus software and for good reason it is blatantly spyware that compromises users privacy i am deeply disappointed at the developers decision to carelessly disregard their users privacy and will not play robocraft or any other freejam game again until i am allowed to play without downloading intrusive third party software sadly i cannot recommend this otherwise excellent game to anyone who cares about their privacy
this review is many years in the making i got involved and dcs about five years ago but just with in the last year i have gotten more serious in learning some of the aircraft i have purchased over the years its takes time and patience to learn each individual aircraft you need to study manuals and you need to do your own research i started with the a10c but have become extremely attached to the bf109 k4 lately and spend most of my time dogfighting online this is by far the best sim out there nothing compares xplane eleven is a clunker compared to this game i own xplane eleven i have purchased several modules on steam but i play the game via the most up to date version off of the dcs website and i also use twenty with the nevada map looking forward to the new normandy map love this game well worth the five hundred or so i have invested so far plus justified a nine hundred and seventy gtx purchase a couple years ago see you in the skies ill be in your six
youll simply have to realize that outside your circle of close dota neckbeard buddies who barely give two s about your mmr despite the painstakingly long hours youve invested into it no one cares nobody when you win and raise your hands up and scream after making the biggest play of your irrelevant dota career no one will join you in your triumph when you lose and scream in frustration your neckbeard buddies will laugh thats about it thats dota it leads to nothing it will give you nothing youll lose the last few friends you have anymore some who wont be able to relate to and a handful who youll lose to the game itself in the end you will try to convince yourself that the 9k hours staring at you through steam meant something but friend they dont you have poured your heart blood sweat and tears into something that will never love you back and you will swiftly realize that you have degraded into that eerie bald man with the slowly rotating valve installed to the back of his head hesitantly turning to you you were the bald man the entire time too afraid to look at you destroying yourself over a meaningless video game
its an unfair game for example i played two rounds with my friend and i lost both times i landed on nearly every of my friends building and he nearly never landed on my buildings i dont recommend this game at all the game is rigged
a really fun game that requires team work to accomplish macro goals and individual prowess to overcome the toughest of enemies am i proud of how much time ive put into it no i wanna kill myself
just never ever worked and anyway be prepared to have to deal with at least twelve buttons just for missiles antimissiles counterbalances radar antiradar flares etc i really tryed the maximum to play this one realllly buh nø so sad edit it finally worked yeah what changed nothing just this time it worked dont ask me why am just glad
early access reviewim disgusted by this company they have set a record they are thief i feel totaly robbed and stealtthey are disgusting company they have just give no information on their game they have cut almost all the content and features who were working totaly fine on their others version and these scammer call it early acess with a cash shop they will just add back the content they have cut each twenty four monthit was a cash grab they are working on nothing and added nothing others that a very bad skill rotation combat they were even unable release the action mode they have show in video for others that one class never buy this game that a pure cash grab by the most disgusting company i have ever seesteam should remove this disgrace of scammer game from their store
early access reviewthis game is smash bros but its not first of its many differences from smash bros is that your legend only starts with unarmed attacks these are weak but can be very fast attacks good for rabbit punches almost litterally then you see a generic icon that looks like a flaming sword stuck in the ground this is a random weapon pickup spot if you grab this you will get one of your legends weapons which include spears guns dual daggers hammers rocket lances and swords these do more damage than your unarmed attacks some attack faster and more powerful than others now here is the equivalent of a special every character has two special attacks one with each weapon respectively some are ranged and some are close range the graphics are kind of cartoony and are really fun you can tell the devs had fun making this game there are also bombs one kind that explodes on contact one that is kind of like a sticky bomb that will explode when touched or after a certain time limit there is also a horn that summons your mechatronic valkerie which flies in with a weapon and on fire hitting your enemies the music is fitting for the arenas and not bad and when you win or lose there is a chat box in which you can say gg or hacker or laaaaag pretty much whatever you want people just log out anyhow its still a good featureall in all i three three three three this gamejust apply for the beta just do it the only thing bad is that you have to pay for skins and taunts with irl money hopefully this will change in the future but for now its not really an obstacle ooooor you could give money to the devs to help add more characters and more arenas
world of guns is an amazing game that is the ultimate customizer and the ultimate learner that should almost be a requirement howver the music almost makes you feel a little like a really cazy person however this you can overcome by making a gun based off of youre contry of origin on the gun the graphics should be updated to be more realistic and thats all exept the experience system whick is almost stupid to unlock all of the guns but still this game should be played
twenty hours on pc and lost track on cell really like this game its good for passing time when working you can run in windows mode i just been palying way sick passing time and i guess i got stock in it again lol
no its not a pay to win because theres no buying in game cash edit you can get all base ships for free and premium skins for microtransactions tl dr still not pay to win as ships all are balanced to eachother expensive ship can be countered hard b early game ships
early access reviewinstalls gamegets in a matchbuys a ump45gets shot by op svdrealizes how graphics are extremely horriblerealizes how options are extremely limitedrealizes how sounds are extremely to steam libraryuninstalls for wasting timebuys a lolipop and chills like a baws
i would recomend this game to everyone because its openworld and is a massive multiplayer fps with amazing graphics and stunning battle experience the one thing i love in this game is that it gives you the ultimate feel and experience of battlefield battles are huge and intense they give you adrenaline everyone should give it a shot at least once game is just fun and stunning
my friend introduced this game to me years ago when it was in alpha and i am proud to say that this lil game has grown up to be a grindy p2w cash grab how that not even sega ubisoft and the likes could come up with such magnitude of genius grinding out weapons available to common soldiers during wwii allowing users who play free to drive the most useless of wwii vehicles such majesty
early access reviewi think this game will be great but they really need to push for getting there low specs on for players to play this game it seem like the programs uses alot of cpu and hard on the graphic card few bugs but it is alpha wouldnt reccommend for low specs computers intill they get the low spec graphics sort out but other then that i would reccommend to a friend
early access reviewloved this game once now they ruined it had tons of weapons in storage because i liked to swap and build different bots now they are useless because i have to recraft things i already paid for before not to mention the total dumbing down of game mechanics has made this such a boring game to play no thanks i am done with this game unless they fix it
you for this game i am really enjoying and i am finding all kinds of ways to be creative this game is really fun and enjoyable and i love the soundtrack gets me through building stuff
i really really want to love this game but i cant the concept graphics and scale are fantastic but overall the execution make it a mediocre fps the combat feels clunky and no matter the settings the weapon feedback just feel completely disconnected from the mouse input like it was built around controller with the mouse being an after thought i dont feel the technology is there for this to run as an fps requires again no matter the settings used the frames just feels wrong and stutters further making the game feel clunky and disconnected in addition there appears to be significant desync issues with cover being almost irrellevant as you may be behind cover on your end but on the other end you are not and continue to take fire when you shouldnt the unlock system breaks the game in a f2p fps game it should be an unlock system that allows you to build classes to your play style however this is an upgrade system that makes you character better faster stronger causing balance issues finally it goes without saying but you will need a team for this one it is brutal for the solo player and even with a public group you will find yourself being stomped by more coordinated teams at the end of the day its f2p so by all means try it but i would strongly advise avoiding spending any cash on it i did and i regret it
early access reviewdo not watse your money on this you will get ten fps no matter what spec you have combat is slow and clunky game have failed in multiple regions and they still havent fixed the fps issue waiting on the queue for 2k queue which is around twenty three hours then i ended up getting dc when im about to get in and i have to requeue again horrible game horrible experience do not recommend
seven hundred dota two changed i hate change i dont like inviting people to my clubhouse to play only those with shared interest enough to learn if you cannot devote time to learn a game its nooks and crannies its negatives and positive nor embrace the community no matter how toxic they do not deserve to play dota two valve and icefrog invited these strangers into our clubhouse for what gain a few cash a slice of the league of legends pie an icing of heroes of the storm all i can do is smile a bitter smile for dota two our clubhouse has been invaded by casuals just like how casuals invaded the gaming scene their tentacles reach out and found its way here say hello to our casual overlords seven hundred is here to stay
i like games like this personally not for everyone but its nice to pass the time with only thing i would like is if the outfits and weapons came in a pack like the hair instead of having to pay for them separately and also make it cheaper if kept individual i would be more willing to actually buy them in support of the dev overall a fun and simple game
early access reviewlmao the game is sooo gay yet sooo manly hahahahahaha wtfhonestly the graphicsgameplay and optimization are so good just add the customization optionkillcamlanding system etc and the game will become greater and please ban the cheaters because i dont want to play another pubg keep it up devs good luck
as with the original planetside this game had and still has massive potential also as with the original the primary flaw is that its purely pvp even eve online has bots and thats about as player driven as a game can be if no one is on or in the area you want to go no soup for you if everyone is there and you are outnumbered well prison sex cant be all that bad now can it
early access reviewgood solid game at its core the devs just need to fix the problems that have persisted for some time such as ship tooltips not displaying correct information and the glaring issues with crew creation i e explain what the hell crew skills do not pay2win yet and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right matchmaking needs abit of work half the time youll find yourself as a novice playing withagainst the top players on the leaderboards but the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable if you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match or if you ever wanted to play world of tanks but in lol this is the game for you my one main issue the devs want thirty worth of platinum to buy one premium ship that is exactly the same as the original ship just reskinned with a pitiful ten expcredit booster thats three times what the game cost at release god damn ridiculous for thirty i expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky expcred boost spoiler you will bash your head on your keyboard after a match on occasion
early access reviewi followed a naked guy into a house he had no pots and pans on him no weapon on his back ez kill apparently he knew i was following him so he got behind the door after he scared the irresistible sausages out of me i shot him like ten times on his last breath he fell with his knife on my chest we both died1010 would eat irresistible sausages again
undoubtedly the best clicker game out there at its core you have tons of characters each of them interacting with others to create the perfect formation to fight waves and waves of enemies of different difficulty every single character has its own upgrades in the form of cards and the cards have their own upgrades and so on and so on basically you have tons of upgrades way more than your usual idle game it can go as far as feeling like an rpg or even a strategy rather than an idle game especially if you check out the wikia page or any guide and there are many of course in the middle of it all are the chests which are your micro transactions you can buy them with real money as well as specific cards and bundles but crusaders of the lost idols is by no means pay to winpay to progress the player regularly receives codes for chests via email and there are plenty other ways to receive boosts without spending any money events the crusaders are filled with events on a regular basis far more often than any game idle or otherwise they aren t different from your regular runs but the variety of characters you can acquire from them is certainly keeping the game fresh finally the community yes a community in an idle game moving on from the initial surprise the game has an ingame chat mostly alerting everyone when someone gets an epic gear but also giving you the ability to ask questions or talk the day away given that the crusaders is not a competitive game the community is extremely friendly by far the best one i ve encountered online i have observed people from all walks of life share their story through the chat and it is well beautiful no matter what type of gamer you are this is something you can easily play between chores or while doing literally anything working watching a movie playing another game i ve enjoyed my fair share of idle games while doing tedious tasks and crusaders of the lost idols is definitely keeping it interesting being rewarding and a bit challenging to top it off
this game is awsome it has a manga style controls r easy to use its got pvp for the competive people quick lvl systemsecret dungons motiple chars for diverse gameplay u can play alone play with friends if i had any or play with complete strangers u can start a gild that have perks the lvl cap is a small sixty at lest right now and the mana pools r kinda small three hundred for each char but its so much fun just dont be chung he is cheap unless u want to be cheap
early access reviewive played for one hundred games and most of those games i got either power screwed or flooded if its not the minimum seventyfive cards deck it is probably because the card rng isnt good
it was good until i realized how overpowered the tier three russian things were the game has been out for so long and is still more broken than battlefield one beta this game is absoulote trash and it deserves to be abandon by its players so maybe the devs will take some time and fix it
early access reviewi kinda dont reccomend it because first there is a lot of hackers second they dont have an anti cheat to keep those hackers away and third its just not really a fun game
so ive played a few of the clicker style games and for some reason kept overlooking this one so finally i gave it a shot and ive not looked back since starting off as a simple clicker game it quickly expands its scope adding on multiple modes of play new ways to progress and branching paths that give you options based on how you want to play want to just idle and not do anything there is a build for that want to click like crazy a build for that exists it has something for everyone
"i think this game is not as bad as other people are saying yes it is a mobile port on first sight big buttons mobile like options menu but is this game bad or worse than world of tanks original no i must say no and here is reason why there are many things that world of tanks blitz is doing better for example friendly fire off so no idiots can kill you because theyhe don t like youfriendly colision is off if your friend or just another player ram youyou will not get damageyou don t have to buy modifications for tank like turretscannonsbetter engine there are no artillery tanks in the game i think it makes wotb better in my oppinion when you get on tier three mm can put you into match on a lot a lot better and bigger maps where you can use both strategy and enviromentmap design before tier three i was putting on not so well looking maps or interestingbut after tier three maps get bigger and a lot funinteresting places and unique mapsbad i must say this i played wot wot is a lot better looking hovever my pc is soo i cant play wot anymore soo yes you get it graphics arent great hovever it is more good for bad pcs twenty million, fifty two thousand and seven graphicsps excuse me if there are mistakes or errors in the text"
do not waste your time on the tank mode of this game you will be oneshotted in any tank you choose except the later tiered russians of courseso many bugs and glitches like invisible bombs falling from the sky with no indication and no planes on the minimapi was playing in a tiger e and i drove about ten meters away from an enemy tiger ii h i shot him directly in the cheeks of his turret on green green indicating you can penetrate and it bounced russian tanks are overpowered and can practically oneshot any tank which makes playing any other line pointless and not fun at all br battlerating is absolutely ed tier three tanks with forty battlerating gets placed in tier five tank matches with seventy eight battleratingpaid fifty for golden eagles which got me to tier three ggglitchy repairs the timer resets randomly sometimes even if you dont get shot or anything so youll be on a minute repair it gets down to like twenty and then it resets and goes to a minute againyou can get oneshotshot from across the map literally be careful going twentyfive feet away from spawn you can and will get yup no spawn protection no cover you can literally spawn and be oneshotted the list goes on and on with bugs and glitches that they dont fixhonestly its a waste of time they refuse to fix these glitches and bugs and i heard somewhere that they were going to buff the russians the now i dont know if thats true but damnplanes is a lot nicer but its boring
early access reviewthis game is really fun i have been playing pubg but this just brings a wole new world and concept into the game i am hopeing that this game slowly becomes bigger and more well known since its sooo fun just hope the sweaty players stay out of here and keep to pub and fortnite there is a problem with gforce now where tha game automatticaly looses connection after about five hundred and ten min of gametime and quits the game it would be really nice if this problem was fixed quickly
early access reviewspend more time on aqw pleaseee this game is good but for twenty eighteens it cant compete with other big game you guys arent getting new players theyre just old aqw player so please spend more time improving aqw
early access reviewservers are ing complete garbage and they most likely wont ever get any better id reccomend not getting into it for the servers alone not going to mention all of the problems with the mechanics in the game
game took too long to instal and when i was done with the instal it launched the launcher i clicked play the loading screen came up and then it dissapered and never opened i waited 30min for it to open and it didnt so i uninstaled to get from main website and steam didnt get rid of all the files and i couldent find them all it wont instal the game watsoever now thx steam would not recomend steam smite to others go download it from the officle website
this is a great mindless game to have on half of a screen while doing other things i do prefer the mobile version better because of the lack of graphics settings in the pc version this game might get boring after achieving the maximum two hundred people can take up to a couple months depending on how often you play
all you kabam haters i feel you ive been playing this since some of the early public builds and ive seen a fare share of stupidity on the part of devs build seventy nine was the last time i played coop dungeons they took stat pots out of god lands and learning to solo dungeons with any character was a game changer for me personally play to win no all the cash you spend isnt gonna get you any better at the game despite all the loot you purchase weve all seen newbs die horribly with tops a stock newb with purchased tops wont hold a candle to a maxed character with midtier gear and they dont officially sell stat potsut items in game so that swag is up to the player not the wallet after lvl twenty with any character your top priority is stat pot acquisition yes it can be a grind and perma death is real but this game would be junk without perma death my advice lay down the one thousand and twenty bucks on a extra character slot and some storage chests you will die lots you will crap keyboards sideways and you will quit perhaps even forever but you could also kick pets made this game so easy anyway that i will agree with some people it was a better realm under wildshadow but i still recommend it to anyone wanting to flex their skills and strut their gear
not enjoy my time with it bills itself as the most generous card game but the majority of rewards are gated behind watching twitch streams and that suddenly stopped working for me one day and support never got back to me
early access reviewive played this game enough now to not recommend it to anyone topdeck mode happens too often the game has a poor future because it is actually too free to play the designers fail to post patch notes most of the time cards are buffed or nerfed with no explanation or the explanation makes no sense communication from the designers is sarcastc brief to the point of little information and uses injokes far too much
i love taking things apart to see how they work so for me this game has been amazing the models are highly detailed the controls are smooth and easy to grasp and the range of guns to choose from keeps growing by the day this is a fun little timewaster the kind of game which you log in to for maybe a few minutes each day to fiddle around in im having a blast so far and would highly recommend this game
early access reviewits the combat from eve online framed in team fortress two matches classoriented objectivebased and slowerpaced and strategic full 3d movement that also allows for viable use of cover effective use of your starship class learning to recognize enemy silhouettes and teamwork is critical and i love all of it very wellexecuted the gameplay feels balanced for early access and the aesthetics hint at an interesting setting like titanfall im a little hooked
once upon a time i was playing multiple facebook games on a daily basis sometimes for hours one was a farming game an aquarium fish breeding game and another a cafe running game one day it suddenly dawned on me that in all of these games i was doing the same things over and over and over with no end in sight no real goals and ultimately no point i would just build up my farm aquarium or cafe to make money to build more make more money build more ect ect ect fallout shelter gives me the exact same feeling it is a decent game i guess can be somewhat addictive but there is ultimately no point to it its just a non productive waste of time ultimately i have decided to uninstall it maybe now ill spend time on a game that has an actual point to it maybe ill just read a book instead
this game has so much potential not play it much but already see that it could be a rival game to some companys needs to add some more features tho and tuning of vehicles if not in game like i said not played it much lol please bring a drifting feature in would be epic
trove is an amazing awesome game the mobs that i battle everyday to level up and protect the world from evil shadows of darkness the graphics are great everything is great play with your friends craft build explore and trove is so awesome that its free
early access reviewreally good free to play game nice graphics smooth and easy handling really nice graphicsrecommend to anyone who bought pubg and was disapointed by the game engine
a fun game to kill some time but also useful in the real world a guy pulled a gun on me once and i bet him i could disassemble the gun and put it back together in record time intrigued he gave me the gun i shot him and ran1010
paytowin game with op trap cards and no cards to counter them or rather very few that are locked behind houndreds of dollars that you need to spend so if you plan to be a freetoplay player look for something else also enjoy the bambooburn meta going on right now if decide to play this game
good game solid combat not as grindy or rng ridden as most quest games overly cute and the character skillclass progression system gives this game a really highreplay value this game is also no where close to p2w for those who are willing to learn the game theres also a characterclass that fits all types of playersplaystyles stamina bar is a real pain though there is no reason why a game should limit players on how long they play a game period anyone who says other wise is simply making excuses and trying to damage control for a system that hurts the game more than it helps it
neverwinter is the son of wow and the brother of tera tera and a huge number of brothers and sisters graphics are okay ui is great very important for mmorpg combat system is classical atmosphere is epic the difficulty is fine tuned neither too easy nor to hard if you dont wanna spend one hundred and fifty bucks per year in wow f2p neverwinter is really worth playing
early access reviewi would only play this game if i was held at gunpoint holding myself at gunpoint to play this game with my buddies is cancer id have more fun eating rasins out of an old mans swamp the meding is broken and the kills dont come easy its a game for tryhard rasin eaters
early access reviewthe combat system in this game beyond crap litterly spam the dam key to do attack and just doesnt feel fluent at all for having a descent pc kinda stupid that barley get sixty fps on not the greatest graphics either when other games with better graphics i can get one hundred fps which kinda sad
this is so terrible it makes me cry myself to sleep at night you cant shoot anything unless you pay for membership so basically you just walking around collecting deer sht until you find one that you cant kill the only good thing is the wacky animations that made me and my friends laugh oh and if you shoot a tree a blood cloud appears
early access reviewokay so i started playing lotro as a teenager but it went south for me when they started letting you buy leveled characters ive been searching for a replacement mmorpg since aq3d is really really good for being in its early access stage it can be improved but its enjoyable i killed a good three hours without even realizing it however some things i would like to see guildclan options where members can create a guild and bring friends together in a permanent setting you can always see when your guild members are onlinepartygroup options where groups of five hundred and twenty people can come together for big battles temporary able to disband but share kills xp and lootmessagingchat options omg please some kind of chat system that allows people within groups clans parties or even just friends to have separate private conversations a friend and i were trying to make a plan of attack and someone else kept butting inoptions from clicking on a person as it is you have to go to the top of the screen and click on their name in lotro i could just right click their avatar in front of mea map that shows you where you are where quests are or what direction to go ina slightly longer respawn time the creatures respawn so fast that sometimes they gang up on you im sure these are all things the devs are planning to get to anyway but this is my two cents these are the improvements id like to see
"early access reviewso far bless for me has been fun abit of a rocky release to the early access version for us in steam but i still enjoyed the last couple days playing is bless the best mmo of two thousand and eighteen no oh gosh no there is no best mmo in two thousand and eighteen dont be silly am i gona cry about the release issues no that is not how adults should act unlike them spoiled streamers i will however watch the devs clean up their mistakes and continue to play the game for fun with my friends do i think alot of work needs to be done on our version they released oh heck yes and unlike alot of the community here on steam i believe in time they will get the game up to how they intended it to be released do i think it is a cash grab no i came from black desert online where you must pay to rng i feel in bless i can comfortably buy the base game and not feel like i have to spend one thousand, five hundred to catch my breath getting to where i feel i should be dont take this as comparing to bdo i love bdo i still play the game so far in the game i see a few postive things one being their actual player base everyone who did not refund and still is actively playing the game is so warming the community in game is not toxic like other mmos i have talked to many players by just exploring the game and they were cool people so thank you spoiled brats for refunding your games bless doesnt need your salty attitudes xd i have had fun doing the pve aspect of bless and taming every thing the most so far i find it is a fresh mmo that everyone who enjoys having a role such as healers or tanking should try bless and not just for five mins and say what everyone else thinks honestly try it as if it was a brand new mmo try it with the knowledge that it is not perfect but nor is any human on this fricken planet so remember this not omgbestgamever oh but he said she said this streamer said but the reviews no just no your an adult or should be if youre reading this so uh act like one and play it the way you want to if you dont like it then that is a you problem not the devs problem i have high hopes of bless not failing as much as it is a older game and our release wasnt up to standards it is still an enjoyable game to play i wouldnt play it seriously as in competitively or wanting perfection"
pay2win game no vehicles have to purchase liscences pros looks okcons pay2winmembership feeno vehicleshave to buy liscenscescant find uiea could have done betteri do not reccomend this game not worth the install one thousand and ten
early access reviewif you are a big fan of super smash bros then youll like this game too the gameplay is like ssb and the champions to use is like league of legends where you get a free champion rotaion and can buy other champs with ingame money you earn through playing matches its a cool game for a quick solo battle and great with friends you can pick from different maps change the colour of your champ and buy skins for them too
early access reviewi played mtgo a lot years ago when 8ed leagues were still a thing been waiting for like ten years now leagues are back but its purely new promoed sets and no casual fun enter eternalits all i ever wanted from magic only with stonehearths nice ux the same depth and an actual option of grinding cards and tix for free a well executed game from end to end im gonna toss some money on it just to say thanks for the fun but unlike other tcgs its all up to me what a brilliant gem one thousand and ten
some kid invited me to play this and the only reason i downloaded this game was to recruit him and brainwash him to join my merryband of morons that complain about the price of a packet of cigarettes and the fact that no girl wants us because we have a big soulpole that hurt their jayjay
i love this game s here a few thoughts why pros massiv scale with infantery vehicle and aircombat mixed in looking for small fights you find them on the less occupied lanes looking for several hundreds of players in one spot your covered as well as a new player you start with the best weapon for each class every other weapon is just a sidegrad example medics are intended as supports and get a rifle thats effective close to medium range but you can unlock through ingame currency or real money your choice rifles that are better at hipfire and so in close range but less effective in medium and long range youre an average or good shooter youll get tones of ingame currency to unlock what you want fastyoure a bad shooter youre still covered either through using your skill to get close to enemies with light assault jetpacks or invisibility from the infiltrator and oneshot them from behind there are certain weapons for that or by supporting as medic and engineer or by deplyoing mobile spawnpoints or by playing artillery as a tank holding down shokepoints from afar and raking in kills and assists that way pro con outfits outfits are like guilds in any other mmo beeing in on makes planetside shine nothing greater than winning a figth while beeing outnumbered three to 1why that here and not in pro getting in one as a new player is confusing there are some outfits that just want to be big and invite every new player they find but then you are in an outfit that most of the time hast several hundred or thousand inactive players and no leadership and organisation fun factor equals zero so then without the game telling you how you need to leave the outfit and find a new one if you have experiance in mmos its easy but otherwise you got no clue since the game does not lead you i love to unlock stuff games were i got everything bore me most of the time planetside has at the moment a really nice pace for unlocking stuff it takes me around twelve hours to unlock the most expensive stuff at one thousands ingame currency and i am a medium good player meaning i have friend who are just half as effective and those who are way faster you cant unlock class and vehicle upgrades with money that is for me a good thing but others will be discouraged because there are some neat sidegrades for the vehicles and classes that take tones of time to unlock since generally the first and fith tier are the only noticable ones the in betweens sadly dont matter most of the time on the other hand does that mean new players are competetiv from the start you can buy weapons implants boosts and cosmetics with real money i like that you want something now buy it not necessary but helps especially when you start the game as a long time player you now how to make certs in a fun way and when as a new player thats hard and so buying sometimes help to have fun personally i started buying first after a few hundred hours as i noticed i want to stick to the game the graphics still look really nice on the highest setting but i personally can hit with all the light effects and recommend some of the optimazation guides on youtube or elsewhere helps a lot with fps and you get mor kills cause the other guy has nicer effects but you get the kill cause you can see him cons you need a relativ strong new pc to run the game with high graphic settings and decent fps construction it is part of the game they infested much time in but it is not good at the moment in short you can build playermade structures of all kind and have really awesome battles there just theres no reason the only reason up to now was a building generating victory points but this building is so extremly easely killed max crash google it if interessted that building a real base was a waste of time so you try to exploit the terrain and make it hard to reach with out building much else at all and then go somewhere else problem is you could defend against said max crash but frontlines are shifting and building a base right at the front is suicidal because building defence takes time and either the enemy rushes you or the front got pushed away by your allies worst part enemies tend to ignore your base because you get near to nothing for attacking it same for the defenders you get near to no points for standing there and waiting implants the only possible pay to win aspect of the game is it game breaking no since if youre the better shooter or surprised them or outnumber them or you sit in a rocket shooting aircraft while hes on the ground you you drop a grenade mine or c4 before his feet or it doesnt matter especially in the big fights that make planetside so great but in a small scale battle with even skill its sligthly annoying as a new player just by playing you get a random selection of tier one implants the highes tier is five you get more implants by winning alerts playertriggered ingame events and you get the second currency needed to upgrad thoses problem tier two three arent worth anything the boni compared to tier one are minimal tier four costs nine hundred iso per implant and is a real upgrade you get one hundred iso per won alert fifty for second place and thirty for last place at best you could earn around one hundred iso per hour but thats unrealistic and tier five costs around two thousands iso the tier five bonus is significant thou sooooo why pay to win an example are the implants battle hardend reduces flinching while getting hit and assimilate you get shields back by killing someone with headshots on tier five battle hardend gives you fifty reduced flinch from enemy fire same as tier four but on a kill that bonus is doubled making it easier to aim afterwards because you have just recoil to compensate for assimilate on tier five replenishes two hundred from your five hundred shields after a headshot kill and recovers thirty of your current special energy healing for a medic jetpacks for a light assault overshield for a heavy and invisibily on an infiltrator you can buy crates that hold aditional implants which you can trade for iso these crates can be bought for three hundred ingame currency for a small one you should never do that bad trade or for seven hundred and fifty ingame currency takes me as an average player around ten hours to earn or you pay for them with real money for a random lootbox meaning more money dumped equals a higher chance of getting the implant you want and having the resouces to upgrade them
a common complaint about videogame with firearms in them is the they arent realistic enough this game changes that this is less of a video game and more of a gunsmith training aid every firearm contained is a real life weapon the mechanics of how they work and how they come apart and go back together is accurate ever wanted to see exactly how your favorite weapon in your favorite fps actually works this game is your answer that being said the gui is a little clunky at times and outside of getting achievements the first person aspects are not great none of this really really detracts from this little gem of a game
ive played it for 6h and all i have seen until now is1 run into a generic dungeon building2 ignore all trashmobs3 attack the boss at the end of the building4 kill the boss and take the loot5 leave the building and search for the next dungeon that looks exactly the same6 repeatin cubeworld at least the dungeons were random generated and interesting every character has three attacks there are no different weapon types please tell me there is more to this game i havent seen yet
whether you like dispensing freedom and democracy or instead prefer getting your cheeki breeki i v damki on this game has something for everyone if youre not a filthy casual that is
if league or dota are too slow paced for you and you dont like the top down perspective then smite is the game for you with a character roster thats more interesting gameplay thats faster and requires more skill and a company that has shown time and time again that they care about their playerbase its the best moba on the market
before this update i would rate the game nine hundred and ten after this update i give it two hundred and ten the main problem is not what they added but what they removed if they only would of kept the valve quick play pub servers a ton of players would not have had a problem with the update but by removing these servers they forced players to use the new casual system and let me tell you it is not casual some of the things we lost i will list below1 you can not just look for a valve pub server to join quick any more you have to join a que to play on the valve servers2 this que can take up to four to ten minutes to get in for me3 if you want just one map expect to wait even longer4 they removed some maps that were in the rotation before this update5 after one side wins you get to go through it all again because you just cant keep playing without queing up again yes people will say go play the community servers but ninety of them are trash the rest usually have two hundred and forty seven of the same map or dont have players on the maps you want to play so until valve corrects this i cant bring myself to give this a thumbs up
i dont like the time you need to have in order to play this game even though its free can be fun but at some point a pain in the a in other reasons i dont recommend this to anyone who doesnt have the time still not going to recommend it just because you constently have to stop playing a game just to see if youve been attacked need more water or food supplies i will keep playing this from time to time but ill never understand how to play the game in a fun way because i dont think there is i dont recommend this
in a nutshell ginormous talent tree with infinite path variety socketed items with similar but even better than final fantasy seven materia mechanic combinations for skills creation imagination is the limit what diablo should really be
early access reviewi actually like this game its not bad to its core it just has alot of issues that need to bet dealt with the servers need ping counters the connection on every ing server is horrible this is the only game where having a bad connection helps you win the weapons seem horribly unbalanced or maybe thats me just getting killed and having to wait five seconds for the lag to catch up i just cant play it the gun play is great but without a solid connection and horrible balance its just hidden under some
early access reviewif you ever watched space movies for the battles between ships get this game its affordable and worth more than is being asked edit had a chance to play a bit more and im very impressed imagine a mix between allegiance and leage of legends with a little star wars space physics to keep things light and focused on the ships and abilities which are varied and specious the game is like five right now but it or else god doesnt love you anymore
this game is a terrible pc port from a mobile game the controles are basically you clicking the buttons insted of tapping them on a phone disadvantagescrap framerateterrible dragonsclips fom the movie
awesome game at first i downloaded it to see if it was any good and oh boy the animations are really well done the duelists voices are great and you dont have to spend anything to build a cool deck and smash your enemies the online dueling is pretty quick and at least i have found opponent almost instantly every time also i have a great time playing as kaiba hes just so mean xdpd push altenter to go fullscreen theres no option to do so ingame
note thehunter is a niche game its a wonderful niche game dont get me wrong but other than the gameplay itself i have nothing but issues with it compare this game to the big name games out there cod bioshock farcry skyrim and so forth ignore the genre production value and sales are what im comparing here in all of these big name games have one thing in common you buy the game you can play it all of it you unlock gear and items as you play through you dont have to buy additional junk just to complete missionsprogress through the game occasionally you will have expansions or addons more dlc that you can buy that will in most cases extend the gameplay but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind so ill take cod one of the best known most loved and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry i think i paid sixty when it first came out that was it for the whole game all equipment all levels and weapons attainable for that sixty oh i forgot to mention that you own the game at that point you dont have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content now thehunter free to play no its not mistitled its deceptively titled the f2p portion conains one rifle one scope a bleat call a camera a gps and binoculars oh thats fine and all but you only get to hunt one animal mule deer on one reserve if anything its a free demo if you expect to see the rich content in this game forget it this demo is nothing more than a snapshot ok so thats what youve gotten for free lets spend sixty on this game like we would any other and see where it gets us forty five for one year basic and another fifteen for three more months thats it thats what you get i would love to say that you get more but you dont you get fifteen months with no additional gear no additional weapons oh you do get the option to hunt on all the reserves you also gt the licences to hunt all of these animals but you still cant because you havent bought the proper weapons proper ammo proper equipment so you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out sixty for fifteen months of play time whats that did i just hear someone squeak the words world of warcraft denied wow at least gave you access to all of its content after youve paid your subscription and no im not going to complain about the subscription as wow iswas an mmo gotta maintain those servers yeah i know thehunter has multiplayer big deal out of the twenty people who enjoy multiplayer thehunter could loose all twenty of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only you guys want to make more money add the cottontails and a crappy shot gun to the free to play version and call it a free demo sell the game for thirty and monthly membership of five make gear and weapons unlockable get rid of the microtransaction garbage i would buy this game for thirty i would pay a five subscription if i had access to all of the games content after i made those purchases thats at least thirty five you guys would have made from my first month five and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription however due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game ive spent fifteen for the subscription had my fill becasue i refuse to spend more money on trivial and temporary purchases and thats it youve made fifteen from me and you wont make any more i dont recommend this game sure download it shoot a few mule deer and call it quits for the price youll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases this game isnt worth the disk space it occupies even with wow purchased when it was released and played for the first year at about one hundred and eighty is still cheaper than this you want a good hunting game play cod or farcry or bioshock you get to hunt people and monsters you get tons of weapons to choose from you dont have to pay a monthly subscription and your purchases are yours to keep dont spend a dime on this game
really good game for a free to play but your options are too limited on what u can do if u dont put any moneyyou have just a few slots to save items so u can keep it on other characters or if your character diesgood weapons also need money and it is annoying having taken something good and dying and losing all your progresssome more things for free would be good
early access reviewi really liked this game before the update classes were what made this game different and it was really interesting to explore the different classes and having everyone on your team have different skill sets now that theyve removed it its too similar to major games such as fortnite and though i do like the skin option classes should come back i will continue to play this game but i would not recommend at least not until they bring back classes if they bring them back i also hope they add more skins as this gives more opportunity to have unique players however i will say the graphics have improved quite a bit so good job on that
i voted not recomended couse the developers dont care about the cumunity amd after i spended tons of gold the game dosent move on no new stuff or even fixes for the game there is so much that needs improvemente amd they just dont care i wish i could have all my mony back couse it was a complet waste at this rate this game will lose all players amd will die if any dev read this stop using our mony in ur shity cars or buying houses amd improve the game
this game isnt bad but hope you never need the help of a gm i was introducing a new player into the game we both were ejected from the server at the same time we log back in shes stuck in the terrain as in nothing but black around here we try stuck killme log inout nothing works we submit a ticket we wait we wait we wait we go find something else to do and we are autologged off we come back seven hours later shes still stuck so either we have to sit there and make sure we dont autolog off to get help thats not happening or seven hours later they still have no unstuck her thats a wonderful way to sell a game needless to say we are going to play a different game
early access reviewworst game of the centurywhere do i start the graphics in this game are disgusting the gameplay its self is so bad i considered whether the developers were just making the game to make a cheap buck or they had just given up on making games halfway through making this the worst game of the century dont download210 orizzonte reviews
so far not good took ages for the server to load started on a beginners server bstepped onto the map and was immediately shot by another player from a sniper position then had to wait three minutes before i was allowed to respawn or pay for immediate respawning cant be bothered with that
"early access reviewedit sixty one thousand, four hundred and eighteen please read this before reading below im not going to delete my past review i meant it when i wrote it but my opinion has changed since i no longer recommend this game the developers do not listen to the community let me start by saying when the content creators the company chose can no longer be silent and they are making content about the giant flaws you know its not looking good at first we asked for more content in response we got 15v15 pvp okay cool a promise for more content coming soon cool andddd a massive damage nerf across the board what ill get back to that later there were people duping items and people making ridiculous amounts of gold off of easy to farm materials that had a price that was literally 100x higher than other materials these players ended up getting a major leg up on other players before these issues were fixed but their gold and items seemed to still remain there were rumors these players got anywhere from a three hundred and fifteen day ban all the way to their accounts were deleted regardless of what actually happened to them this left the market in a terrible spot trading was introduced it doesnt work and wasnt mentioned in patch notes we found it accidentallybut back to class balancing the balancing after the first large nerf was shaky and it seemed like they were just letting loose reckless adjustments not slight ones either hoping that it would hit the mark and solve the problem rangers got a ridiculous amount of cdr on skills berzerkers trashed guardians nerfed paladins left with spitball damage and nothing but an inconsistent cc combo chain and a heal and so on some of us thought that getting our hands on current end game gear would help compensate for these nerfs but that ended up being a dream that was swiftly crushed players started getting to max level forty five and realized that the drop rates for the purple grade level fortyfive gear are very small something close to five that sounds bad but its worse once you realize its five just for a random class gear piece with a random rune slot to be shared by the whole party we were told this was intentional not a bug these gear pieces dropped from the level fortythree and fortyfive dungeons the level fortythree dungeon was insanely difficult post damage nerf there is a bug that can cause infinite mobs to spawn if you wipe in a certain spot final bosses enrage timer is notorious beating this is the only way to get master crafting quest done the fortyfive dungeon is easier than the forty three not even worth mentioning but these dungeons can only be accessed twice a day which means your grind for this purple gear is even more limited since then we have been begging for end game drop rates to be fixed crafting materials to drop so we can craft blue grade level thirtyseven armor we couldnt even get the material to craft it which meant constantly running the level thirtyseven dungeon until you got your entire set as drops runes boost gear stats to not all break on pve deathinstead we got a new world boss and a silent nerf was not mentioned in the patch notes that took the set bonus from the level fortyfive purple grade gear and spiked it into the ground i brought up this ninja nerf in the official discord and i was banned from talking because i was spreading rumors about the game but other players started noticing and confirming the level fortyfive purple gear nerf and some of the officials in the discord went silent now you might ask why are you upset a new world boss thats the content you had asked for in the beginning well optimization is still non existent silent nerfs are a terrible business practice and the world bosses drop trash unless youre extremely lucky theres a lot more i had high hopes neowiz would turn things around i tried to keep an open mind and embrace it as early access but its obvious they dont care52818 this is going to be a very long post ill start my review by saying this yes i recommend this game i find the pieces that make it fun outweigh those that drag it down if youre looking for an incredibly well polished uiexperience with perfect translations this is not the game for you here are pros cons recommendations for the developers and a discussion pros fun combat the combo system feels nice imo very fun pvp a guild mate and i accidentally started a faction war in an open area last night and spent two hours laughing while we and the union zergs kept going at it taming system is really fun nothing like riding a giant caterpillar into battle large world dungeons are fun mix between pve and pvp is well done not p2w crafting and gathering is a rather smooth experience regardless of what everyone else is saying the devs are trying they just issued a public apology for the rough start and have been very on top of fixing issues that alone is a pro that most people dont give credit for yes its their job but so many other early access games almost never make it to a full release and leave their product dead and unfixed so props there cons poor optimization this can be easily fixed by editing an ini file the fixes are all over reddit its not hard to find very poor translations servers are somewhat unstable supposed to be fixed during this maintenance market board is buggy i would be more forgiving on this point if there were trading or another way to tradesent items to friends and guild mates but currently it involves one person posting an item on the market board for the minimum value allowed a few minutes of waiting the receiver trying to grab the item before someone else does but the search doesnt always work so its means spamming to try and get the item to show up to even figure out if its posted some parts of the game havent been implemented yet see recommendations and discussion recommendations build on the guild experience add a guild chest guild house etc more content for us to do as a group add way for us to help out other guild members with gear instead of trying to go to the market place at the same time and one of us trying to scoop up whatever the other just posted for as cheap as they can post it accelerate the addition of existing content we have gear dropping for assassinmystic but dont have the classes also we have dungeons for the current level cap that dont drop loot because of this theres no incentive to do those dungeons we also have slevel for unlocking the last two skillstraits content beyond level forty five and other pieces of the game that i would love to experience but they are still unavailable discussion as mentioned in the pros the pvpve balance is done well it will only get better as content is added i am shocked that so much of the community dove into a game that is labelled as early access bought a founders pack to get a head start in early access early early access and are raging about the imperfections yes the game has been released in three other regions it should be at least more well optimized but that also means we knew what bugs to expect if they arent fixed on the other regions why would they bring us the game all polished and not bring it to the other regions first where these players have been waiting also regarding the server issues i personally feel as though they didnt expect some of the larger streamers to bring attention and more people to this game causing queue times and full servers they are even being very lenient on refunds for people who are absolutely unsatisfiable thats a great move by them honestly tldr there are problems its early access its to be expected but i like this game a lot so far and cant wait to see how it improves with time"
ì ì lol clickbate xdin all seriousness this game is fun once you get good at it so i r8 it thumbs up
early access reviewi thought i would really like this game and i really did you see i put did thats because i reallized that there are so many hackers in this darn game every demo game i join there would be a hacker with a auto gernade launcher with unlimited ammo or a auto rpg with unlimited ammo it really sucks when you cant even come close to win a game when someone is cheating like that would like if there was a banning system or a anti cheat program involved would make the game a lot better in so many ways besides that every other gamemode is perfectly fine and i think this game is amazing besides the fact of hackers would strongly recomend
early access reviewthe game seems fun but the twich promotion is one of the worst executed advertisement ive seen if youre going to attract new players who might have played other card games dont make them sit through a very long unskippable tutorial i played through the tutorial and because of a verification issue had to relog and was made to start the tutorial all over this completely killed any drive i had to try your game there should really be a button to skip the tutorial the fact that this isnt in a game in this day and age is baffling
there is only one word that i can say to describe this game boi this is definetly one of my top five games to play list the realism is amazing the physics are great the use of the ultralow graphic settings makes this game absolutely playable on a laptop max fps i got for this game was fortyseven fps definetly get this game
if you like diablostyle games and sorting through massive piles of loot to see if theres anything worth equipping youre gonna like this a lot add in the fact that its free and the things in the cash shop are entirely cosmetic and optional and you really cant go wrong
the game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring every one hundred rooms 1floor there are generally two or three stuff happening a big room which is actually multiple rooms with spooky stuff a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor and some notes left by some dude for you to read otherwise youre just walking through the same rooms over and over sometimes you think a room is important but its actually just a regular room with nothing special oh and jump scares but when youre not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas hopefully its free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that youre wondering if youre not paying the game with your time
early access reviewfor the first fifteen months this game used to be incredibly fun i hit master in ranked and draft after i got the first competetive decks built the f2p aspect is extremely fair you conistantly get new cards to improve your library some colors have been more dominant than other time because of their incredible wide access to game winning mechanics carddraw ramp undercostesd legendaries like sand storm titan but the meta was still fairly diverse and since there werent as many sets it is normal for a new card game to not have certain deck types enabled while others will be more reliant combo vs midrange for exampleso i was expecting the devs to address these issues but they actually managed to do the exact opposite time got by far the most playables in the new set they got improvements in almost all areas bigger creatueres more consistant ramp and the marked allowing for an even more consistant three turn threat it got to the point where the entire meta is basically only time decks whoever is responsible for the development of the time faction should get fired seriously what in the world are you guys thinking it forces people to basically play removal piles and they still cant manage the never ending armada of threats time plays there is no thought required to build a ranked deck just slap all the time playables together and hurr durr you will win no synergy no concept just get the big ops as quick on the board as possible and dw to think about it the devs did all the thinking for you when they threw all the mechanics on the cards for you where other factions have to work to get their synergies working add certain cards to grind through your deck maybe even a tutor time just has it inherent in their cards creatures with card draw on power drop creatures with removal included creatures with global flyerlock just throw them together and you have this game figured out i was looking forward to the new expansion but after a week of facing the same exact deck and reviewing the designs i am one hell of a salty customer that is turning away from your product too bad i really liked the game up until this point but with as little foresight and understanding of meta balancing that the devs showed with their newest stick i know enough to see where this game is going nowhere
probably the best game in existance it would be minecraft or fortnite but this is the one i prefer especially because of the candy biome i love that one xd and in this game xd34thk1ll3rxx wasnt taken like other stupid games my little brother tries to steal the controller buti dont let him haha also it runs on my laptop so i play it under the covers after bedtime so my mum doesnt beat me lol
access reviewinstead of trying to completely reinvent the battle royale wheel ring of elysium does enough to set itself apart amidst a streamlined polished and fun take on the genre
i lost leadership of my clan because i took a break from this game the leadership transferred to some random guy in the clan i spent more than two years building up my clan from scratch and it is all taken away from me i contacted support and they wont do anything about it lowrez move bs system
early access reviewa thirty five game for sure pros wwii shooter f2p the scale of the war and the fact that it is entirely dynamic having a good game in this game leaves you feeling especially satisfiedcons shooting and movement feels extremely clunky see drunk niko and roman the sound of the guns is ehhhh massive amounts of grinding required to get anything interface could be betterin short if you like wwii games and have some spare time you might find this game an amusing distraction
early access reviewthe game wasnt bad at the start it was really nice getting use to the switch combos was the hard part of the game then i got banned because i was using a outside program i have no out side programs so i got banned for no reason on that one wasted seventyseven hours on this game to get wrongfully banned contacted customer support and that so far hasnt been worth it cant even get a response
so when you first start this game you think woah so much content but usually it only takes about a few months to get litrally everything in the game this is why you only see new players the people who have played this game for so long usually quit after a few weeks because its easy to accomplish so much kind of like skyrim if you play it alot without modsbut i like this game because people who are new to mmorpg games can learn from this even though the interface is differentby the time you see this review im probably still working my way up too my goalmy goal you ask im trying to complete everything like every portal boss dungeon get every gear highest level with all classes every mount etci have faith in this game and i hope to reach my goal and when i do i will vow to help every person ever also even though i only had fifty minutes into this game i am on like portal nine
early access reviewi dont have alot of hours into this and i almost never write reviews but this game is alot of fun i have played alot of pubg and tbh i like this game better looks better feels better and plays better and i mean who dosent wanna pull a drive by on a hang glider with a deagle
great game its like a better version of the janes usaf love the sound affects i just wish they had made the cannon on the a10a just a little bit more powerfull did a straifing run on a tank six times and the tank was still alive
early access reviewi must admit i was really suprized to see all the negitive remarks about this once great game how ever they are all right they have completly screwed this game up progression is completly gone they have turned this game in to a complete pile of crap after playing a few matchs over the last month too add the game has zero balance game breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed pay to win heavy and laggy as heck do not give these greedy devs anything till they fix this pile of junkas of july tenth nope just nope let the id10ts suport this trash there is no balance at all level 20s going up aginst level one hundred bots lol pointless i started a new account just to test to see what kind of bots i ran into by the time i hit level twenty i was going up aginst bots the size of my main account each level you get more cpu more cpu equals bigger stronger parts which is one hundred one hundred and fifty is cap weapons that basicly one shot you over and over and over the only thing the match maker does is put player in a game this is no tier or level grouping no balance at all then theres the weapons lol teslas are a noobs best friend require zero skill and basicly instal kill anything they run into and of course dont forget the lag your dead before you even see what hits you i am so very sad this is the current state of this game the devs have decided that a pay2win model is better as well as not even tring to balance anything if you want to bang your head on you desk over and over and over by all means install this game if you like being constanly pitted aginst bots that take your entire team to killwhile your whole team is destroyedinstall this game if you want a fair balanced game play do not install this trash
early access reviewnow i was very hopeful going into this knowing full well that it is a very early access copy adventure quest worlds was one of the more entertaining browser games i ever got to play as a child and i was very curious to see just how that would translate into a modern 3d image as a whole however i still find myself disappointed just not for the reasons you would think i the combat and the controls1 the combat i personally had no quarrel with the controls or the combat style of the game keeping in mind that the games design is true crossplatform if i had to comment on it its not a very good idea to have everything limited as though it was a mobile only game what does this mean well the hud is exactly what you think it is four to five buttons on the bottom right corner detailing your different abilites of which there are really only four for every class as the fifth button is your autoattack and your health and mana bar both of which seem very insignificant as unless youre heading into very high level territory there really isnt anything that can pose a threat to you not to mention it seems next to impossible to run out of mana unless youre fighting a boss mob as someone whos playing on pc its not that im expecting tons more from a game thats programmed to work on a cell phone however it still feels like artix particularly focused on the mobile aspect now i can only imagine this will change in the future when the devs have had more time to properly work on the game for now however it feels like the only thing thats keeping personal computer users in mind is the fact that theres a controll scheme set up for them speaking of which2 the controls again i have no major complaints here save for the fact that they are far too simplistic for a game like aq i do expect more than just click to interact and press a button to attack at least outside of their 2d games which even then had more interactive capabilities than this this is another case of the game being too one sided towards the ios side of the target audience i still think that there will be improvement and it would be unfair of me to not give the developers time to do so however its still upsetting that it feels like the game was released into beta far too early given that they desired to capture the attentions of two separate users lets take a look at some other aspects of the game yes ii the graphicsagain definitely onesided towards mobile users but and a big one too theres no denying that this is almost a necesity i definitely dont find myself complaining too much as adavanced graphics for pc users is something that can be integrated in the future like just about everything else that needs to be added to the game its art style is simplistic but still reminds me of the aq universe i explored when i was younger there really isnt anything more i can say about this section really nextiii the world itselfhow can i put this gently its empty like completely empty and almost entirely devoid of npc characters that are designed to be interacted with in battleon the main town in the game that aq is known for i found more hostile npcs than anyone to talk to it seems they have many areas for the game already designed but they have yet to fill them with characters that either give you quests to which there is at least one per area shops of which there are next to none especially for low level characters that often depend on at least one or two buys so they can last long enough to get armor from grinding something rather redundant as the first shop that actually has any of this only sells things that you can very easily grind for and overall life to the region itself battleon is a town that looks like it was abandoned in preparation for a full scale war oh did i not mention that all the nonhostile npcs in the town are just generic guards that cannot be interacted with im starting to ramble next sectioniv questsfor a game called adventure quest there really arent that many quests every single one i ran into was either a fetch mission or a kill this many of this enemy mission both of which are flawed in a few ways fetch missions can be completed far too easily as the items needed are literally pointed out to you meanwhile hunter quests are just the opposite kill this many of that monster okay where is the monster thats it how am i supposed to find it if i dont even know where it is the fact that i ran into this exact same predicament at least five times before even ending an hour not too good again and i cant really stress this out enough the game is in an extremely early access build so i cant really say im entirely dissappointed as there really wasnt much to expect in the first place v conclusionoh were at the end already that was fast anyway despite all that ive negatively mentioned i like the way that this game is heading i really do think it has potential and i cannot truly blame the developers for any of it my final conclusion is that the game was released into its public testing phase far too early essentially there isnt really anything to test yet as you can most likely read on the top of this review i havent even played for a full hour and yet i feel like ive already done everything the game currently has available to do artix entertainment had once managed to capture my young feeble heart with the majestic browser game known as adventure quest worlds even if i didnt know what i was doing there was enough in it to keep me at least guessing what i had to do i would argure that for mobile the game would feel more complete were it not for the fact that ive played full scale mmorpg games in the past on my phone that felt far more diverse than this if i had one suggestion to make to artix its this dont be afraid to add on to the game right now i had everything on maximum and my computer didnt know what was happening as it had never run a game so smoothly before the game is not in the least bit finished much less finished enough for stress testing there is literally nothing to test here guysvi final verdictdo i recommend the game no at least not yet i recommend that you keep an eye on the game and the progress of its development as i know for a fact that artix is a company if you can really call it that given how few of them there are that likes to trully cater to its audience and try their very best to help them out wherever they can but right now the game isnt worth playin unless youre testing the mobile aspect of it
early access review ing game devs banned my account after spending over fifty ingame refused to do anything or give a reson to why avoid the game i will be taking the company to court
business tour online multiplayer board game reviewbusiness tour is a game which is supposed to act as a digital clone of knownbyeverybody board game monopoly is it a worthy successor yes i think so and in this review im going to prove it gameplaythe gameplay is simple all you have to do is press the roll button when its your turn and buy the stuff you want to buy you get the money when you cross the start basically the way this game works is like the original monopoly except you use a mouse the gameplay is wellmade so to speak there are things this game lacks or has different than in the original monopoly you cannot trade things this easily also a nice plus is the possibility of online multiplayer graphicsnot much to say here the graphics are simplistic no flashy animations here it makes the game look decent musicthe game has only one tune playing in a neverending loop luckily enough this theme is not short and is pretty catchy it really made me enjoy the game more to summarize it all business tour online multiplayer board game is a decent game its good to enjoy with your friends its fun to play i advise you to play it you wont regret it
early access reviewonce great now awful this game used to be a cross between minecraft and world of tanks but now it a p2w mess7 months later nothing has changed 11316it makes me sad to see what has happened to this game 33117its beyond the point of no return
amazing game and tons of potential horribly brought down by numerous bad design decisions and bugs rather than patch the bugs and bad design patches introduce more pay to win mechanics
been playing this from the beta days it was exactly when bakasura came out for the first time i can assure you that this game is one of the best moba games out there and about the steam release i couldnt get more excited
product received for freeearly access reviewi used to play the robocraft often but after the new epic loot update i personaly think that instead of being able to choose what you want to have and create your own unique play style it has become if you pay you can get the materials needed to do and create what you want with the loot crates you are given as a reward for playing you get one hundred random items and yet i have never got anything i wanted that wasent in the premium slot which of course you have to buy premium to unlock another thing that i disaprove of in the update is the robits feature which are what you use to forge parts but the only way to get them is to recycle what you already have for about one hundred and twenty five of its value depending on its rarity
hackers and bugs abound not worth the time and frustration if youre looking for something to just completely waste time costs nothing and you dont get frustrated easily try this otherwise dont i will be looking elsewhere for my zombiebattle royal fixation
early access reviewthe worst fps i ever played and i have played a lot from prject black out to call of duty cg so all those twitchy squad shooters now this this actually makes me want to installa notorious p2w game than play this poor game ok well i give it this it tries to be equal if any one is familiar with begone a unity based squad shooter for free this is the same thing you log in load up on kill credits and pay at spawn for armor grenades etc so it starts most people off equal and you build up as the match stays open i personally like that than hard load outs but this game losses all points when one the maps feel baby block desing hard to explain but super simple mushy non thinking turn here fire two because of this design the damage and hit detectioni is so off it feels like you are getting hit by paintballs but problem is i played better paintball sims you can walk up and unload two full clips to peoples head and i guess there is a rng where sometimes it is a headshot and other times you just slowly reload and refire it is soo bad it just feels so fake and silly it gives it charm though if you are tired of one shot kills ing ames like cs go and doubt who is a hacker or or skilled play this no doubts everything is pillow fight calculations you can swing hit a head but sometimes you get em right in the eye three buggy this is what happened i log in play a round ok earn enough to buy a grenade found out it is cool you buy it once dont need to rebuy each spawn game ended i quit the match joined a new server to get new group of guys and it says i have one grenade in the bottom right i thought oh cool i use it nothing happens die oh a bug that makes sense i dont have one i jsut started and dont have the kill credits yet i can live with that bug so i go back out decide to do a wall clip shot you know you shoot the edge of the wall as you edge out to get anyone hiding behind wall and use your own cover fire i die who killed me me i somehow killed myself i can only guess this the ricochet off the wall like this game is either so great sog epic that it calculates deadly ricochet into my skull or it is so pathetically failing at being an fps that it has no idea itself as a game who killed me i uninstalled on match two i can no longer continue pure cancer oh yeah before i left i hung out in match a little longer because i noticed a lot of russians with high knife score in a gun battle i saw a guy passing walls floating and invisibble one shotting with a knife hacked cancer the worse there is seriously you can get a better experience on a web based shooter called begone
heros and generals is a unique blend of fps and strategy unlike anything else around at the moment adding these two components together with a dev team that frequently adds new and improving features make this game one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played the games nature encourages you to play with other players from all over the planet and getting to know new friend this way makes this game exceedingly addictive and a lot of fun to play the dev team are excellent at keeping cheats at bay and despite being a small team do an amazing job at keeping up with player desires the bad as they do have a small team offten response times can be slow so getting feed back from the devs is very difficult some decisions on the direction of the games progression sometimes clashes with the experienced players having each new faction added at war with existing factions apparently the plan is that once the british are added they will be at war with the germans the rusians and the usa the devs can be slow to revert to better systems after getting feedback some decisons do leave players wondering if the devs have time to play the game much themselves ie squad twenty and new spawn sitesprotection system overall thou this is an awesome game with no competition out there that offers such a wide range of toys and playing levelsthe grind is horrendous but still worth it if you can stick at it
early access reviewone of the best battle royale game out there with no doubtwell made with very little bugs i did not find any bugsjust won my first game as well with two killswould recommend to everyone that loves battleroyale games
early access reviewgreat game reto constantly adding new features weapons maps etc sometimes a bit buggy when they first release it but they iron it out fairly quicklythis game is split into two parts first person shooter side which is fairly straightforward but depends on what units are positioned on the realtime strategy map as you level up youll be able to move some teams around on the rts map yourself and give your fps player some backuprespawns etc the three factions fight for control of europe which you win by capturing the majority of the major cities on the map expect there to be changes to the gameplay they intend to change it a lot as the game develops but i think thats a good thing the game will never get old and you know theyre activly working on it and adding new stuff
have you ever played battlefield well if you have this is like a space battlefield this game is something my friends and i play all the time because of the epic battles and tactics that come with it the people who play it are nice and calm until a battle breaks out and the only battle cry you hear is taco bellother than the randomness of your clan mates you will ride in incredible awesome vehicles and your only goal is to run over every last person you see this game brings out the wildness inside of you because of the fast paced battles and the epic airdrops into the enemy territory overall you need to get this the updates may be long and boring but the new stuff is so cool you forget what an update is rating one thousand and ten
early access reviewhave spent forty and six hours trying to get into broken online only to find that they temporarily have restricted creating characters on certain servers guess where all my friends and my guildies are on the server i cant make a character on shame on you devs how on earth did you come to thing that was a proper solution of all things i would refund in an instant but i am holding out just because i want a new game to play with my friends so frustrating your game will be dead within the month if you dont bust your asses to fix this
it is interesting the graphics is of high quality but there are too many cards fifty for a new player it might seem difficult to manage them and for a card game it was running slowly in spite my pc fits the requirements i would not recommend this game unless you are a big fan of card games
this game may lag on low end computers but even if its inspired from minecraft terraria or whatever i still like itbecause the more you play the less youre gonna want to get out of itmy rating for this game eight hundred and ten
early access reviewi was torn between writing a serious long review of the game or a short funny review of the game when in doubt humor dont play this game with a full bladder1010 would wet myself again
product received for freeme and my friend download the game to battle each other and unless you play against random people then all you have to do is camo iron balloons and you instantly win how boring can a game be unless you pay a load of money to unlock the full game wast of time unless you want to spend time battling other people and not friend
crusaders of the lost idols is a strategy game hidden as an idle clicker your formation counts your equipment counts your talents count you just dont have to play nonstop to progress unless you want to
early access reviewso i just played my first game and wow the game runs insanely well at amazing graphics that would be appropriate for an aaa title by insanely well i mean one hundred and ten fps on a ten sixtys 6gb on nearly max theres only one complaint i have with this game and its a very big one the sounds now im no audiophile and dont listen to music at all but the sounds in this particaular game are absolutely disgusting and horrible pthe sounds are muffled you cant hear around you stereo or surround sound i think thats what its called so it always seems like the sounds are coming from the back of your head gunshots are muffled the sound effects for the zone dying etc are just loud and extremely bad if you could fix the sound issue i would without a doubt play this game everyday so developer if you are reading this then please fix these sound issues i doubt it will take very much of your time and will make the game so much more enjoyable as a player thanks for readingedit holyâ â â â â â nevermind it was my headset this game is insanely good ignore everything i said
please do not play this game i dowloaded it and entered to the character screen after seeing how the character screen looked i deleted its local content later that day i thought i may have been to harsh on it so i installed it again i tried to ignore the character creation screen and i played about ten minutes before deleting the local content again again please do not play this game

early access reviewi ve thought a lot about this game and now i want to say about it first the game is better than pubg second it looks not so monotonous or common third there are three classes which arent different but they are very interesting and finaly the game is free so this game is good not the best but good if you want to play battleroyal you have to try this seven snowstorms out of ten
to be fair this game has great investment in the vehicles sounds and models the game looks great however gaijin could care less when it comes to making good maps balanced matchmaking good events hiring competentfriendly pr staff the list goes on im adding my opinion to the rest of them currently in order to show gaijin they messed up by reintroducing chronicles such a unfun unbalanced mess that it was removed from future events the current event achievements are damn near impossible for anyone who wishes to grind them out and have a life and thats coming from someone who is on disability currently and has no life many things in this game steer players towards just saying screw it and opening up the wallet to be effective right from the get go they introduce the atrocious grind i watched a player stream his first week on this game and he barely unlocked three tanks playing four hours a day without premium and i hear it only gets worse in the later tiersgraphics beautifulgameplay goodaudio very goodaudience everyonepc requirements decenti get one hundred fps on high with gtx960difficulity easy to learn hard to mastercontrols are easy to pick up but there are some advanced controls that you must look up or bind yourself and controlling each vehicle and learning its pros and cons will take a long time considering that you must unlock upgraded to be fully competitive you start off at a disadvantage also matchmaking is based on the perceived effectiveness of the vehicle according to the dev called battle rating and not based on player skill or level so after you get out of tier one bot matches you will be placed with veteran players that can snipe your tank at all the chokepoints because theyve memorized the map and distances to the targetsgrind average grind level too much grind insanityive marked two because there are two different levels the grind level will be insanity if you dont pay for a premium account to boost your research points if you do so the grind becomes about average you will still not likely unlock things very quickly even with a premium and even though it negates the unlocking grind for vehicle trees gaijin will introduce event vehicles decals and tournaments that are insanely grindy and time based giving players usually only a day or weekend to complete which is hard for people with lives to managestory doesnt have anyliterally no story unless you count the historical campaigns thrown in last minute not worth playing dont bother they give you a crap reward for playing and most of them are insanely hard to do on anything but arcade mode some can be fun to waste time in or get the hang oftry out vehicles you may not usually use but thats about itgame time very short short average long endlessyou will probably play this until you are dead if you want to unlock everythingbugs few bugs ive had some spawn glitches mostly related to lag and some questionable things happen to my vehicle and shots but otherwise nothing to speak ofmultiplayer salt level saltyif you play tanks rb you will die from someone you cant see miles away over and over again be ready for it you will want to firebomb gaijins hq for being so mean to their customers and putting out crap eventsservers can get laggy ive had some games where ive been unable to spawn or even exit the match because the server will report two thousand and twenty five packet loss on american servers when i do leave the game because of the server issue i get slapped with a crew lock on all my vehicles for not staying in the gameserver status you might wait a minuteusually can find a game pretty fast especially if you are playing on a few different servers never really waited more than five minutes normal wait time is twelve minutesmatchmaking you might see much more experiencedstronger players unbalancedyou will face people at any experience level because the game is balance based on the vehicles you use and not your player skill once you have unlocked your first tier ii vehicle the game places you right into the fire you will face max leveled players while you are just beginning to learn the game high tier players will use low tier vehicles to seal club since they can memorize the map and weak spots on all the tanks and use this to their advantage thats not even touching on the inherent advantages some nationsvehicles have over others at certain tiers of the game
no this game does not use redshell according to the original reddit post where everyone is getting the list of infected games from this game was a false positiveanyways back to the actual review a decent idleclicker game with a lot of depth i would recommend it to those who like this kind of game i do enjoy the fact that there is no music or annoying sounds as with any idle game ever you get real tired of the same music and sound effects after a few hours lol
an mmo with a great active combat system lengthy and robust progression rich lore from the grandaddy of rpgs itself sounds good right well yes this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive so where does it go wrong honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole now being an mmo errors and problems will surely show up from time to time i mean theyre called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldnt expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to onehitkill endgame bosses attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers which allows them not to be hurt or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few along side the numerous comabt exploits are those have allowed players to gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited the exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to some are still present next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to mmos but the path that these developers take with them is which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so last but not least is the f2p model that they use which before module six i didnt really have a huge problem with whilst i did spend more than enough money on this game premodule six it was more of a luxury than a necessity now with what i have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module six upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement pay to win feels like it has made its way here when all is said and done i did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new mmo as in its current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money instead what i would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an xbox one is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and its community whereas the pc staff seem to barely listen to their playerbase on the whole
after playing it for about a weekdecided to uninstallthere are just too many small unfun problems with the the gamethe ai is braindead without gimmick decksthe vagabond is a freaking cheater and aside from arena matches its really boring its a nonstop grindfest farming gems and daily rewards and components to get more cards theres no community fuctions outside of the chats that a filled with spam bots for gem scamming websites so you really dont get to chat with other players aside from having to signup on the the games forums i really dont recommendits really only half the fun of yugiho with none of its actual charm
early access reviewi played this game for so long when the publisher is still gemscool coz im from indonesia then it comes to steam so glad that finally i can play this game again just make this game absolutely secure from cheaters and i think its gonna be a good good game and can contest any other fps game and add some feature like vote kick add some guns that can be bought by bullet coz i dont see bs coin is usefull if its so hard to obtain and add some special guns which presented in previous bs version hope this game get big succes
you have to get the guns full access dlc otherwise its not worth it the f2p part is more like a demo than anything else try the game and if you like it get the full access wait for a sale it goes for twenty or so buying individual packs or credits is a waste of money imo and if you want to unlock the guns without paying good luck with that this is not a f2p game but if you are into gun mechanics this is a pretty good game
best modern aircraft combat game at this time one thousand and ten realism but i play on the standalone version because the steam version is not updated just the damage model that needs to be reworked
early access reviewgood fast games with allot of weapons to buy if you want to buy skins have to pay but thats nothing more to do with the game but with the skins and only the problem is that there is allot of cheaters with aimbot guy with sniper jumps out the corner and shot you right in the head ok if that happend once but all team members who going througt that way had the same problem and not only once
most generous ccg ive ever played because you can earn dust vs the ai you can grind an epic card in about one day and a legendary card every four days this makes this an extremely fun game to play as f2p if there is an awesome deck that you dont have the cards for you can grind them up in a very reasonable amount of time this is my go to ccg and i have tried them all i cant wait for the mobile release this summer
probably the best f2p model i saw in any mmorpg let me explain why in the cashshop all you can buy is fashions weapon look cosmetics if i remember well there is no weapon in the cash shop only nongameneccessary item so you can perfectly beat the game without spending a dime there is pet mounts and all i said before in tghe cashop i heard that in some events you could get some kind of cash shop items characters there is no gender possibilitys in this game all you can change is their apperance by using some fashions for the skill slot you get half of it and its something like five for each character or the one you really want otherwise you are limited to four spell in your action slot which is fare more tthan enougght to start the game but later
early access reviewused to be really fun with bros but updates have thrown this game out the window its the most pay to win game ive ever known and theres barely any fun anymore if you have a few thousand dollars then go wild
early access reviewthis is the working beta of the first unitybased artix entertainment game bright colorful cartoonish 3d graphics with quirky goofball dialogue are the trademarks of this small development team out of lakeland florida the game is in a constant cycle of development patches and updates as previously stated this is an open beta new content is added on a monthly basis generally speaking the newest update dragons of ashfall added new beasts new dungeons npc characters the beginning of a new chapter as well as an increase in the level cap there are several dozen hours worth of quests to experience with more being added on a regular release schedule the game is a straightforward mmorpg with a twist the full game can be played on a laptop tablet or phone on the same servers a friend playing on a laptop can instantly join in with a friend playing on his tablet as they fight in the same dungeons if two players have a gap in level the lowerlevel player can sidekick up to the higher level to gain experience and rewards as they fight on an even playing field trades weapon fusion pvp and more features are being developed to continuously add to the full game goblins dragons and undead skeletons await battle on
early access reviewfor the people that dont know it its a joke game its just something the developers of enlisted released as an april fools joke i guess people liked it so they are gonna release it as a standalone mode but it was never intended to be a game
ive seen a lot of people conplaining about how you can get the real one yes you can get the real one but you can also get this version so you can play your tanks that you didnt get on the normal pc version over all this game is real great i have some premium tanks that i dont have on the pc edition so overall if your gonna get a premium tank just get it on the xbox or ps4 edition or even on the pc
early access reviewthis is a very good game for free the one downside is if you dont or cant play online the hardest bot is incredibly easy good controller layout occasionally online servers will spaz and everybody will go to about thirty points then the server crashes and all is restored
its a musthave game unique in many ways and extremely enjoyable also features trading which is way bigger than you might expect be sure to give tf2 a tryedit i proudly nominated team fortress two for the test of time two thousand and sixteen and labor of love two thousand and seventeen and two thousand and eighteen steam awards
this game is probably the worst i have ever played first of all the graphics are worse than minecraft then there is the whole sprinting thing even while sprinting you go as fast as my grandma after thanksgiving terrible gameplay too you can hunt about five animals without paying a ridiculous amount to hunt other animals ten thousand and ten
early access reviewgives hella free realms vibes in the best way possible300 improvement over aqwaq not as cringey dialogue interesting art style decent starter classes and less annoying sound effects the 3d modeling is also quite well done and lets the concept artdesigns portray themselves better than the 2d flash animated counterparts
skipped classes thanks to dota 2learned to gamble thanks to dota 2learned to swear in twelve different languages thanks to dota 2became racistt thanks to dota 2all in all ruin your life simulator one thousand and ten would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself cancer can be curedrussian and sea communities cant be free to play game cant complain
i love this game it brings great aspects from games like wot and marries it with a three dimensional enviroment and ship with drastically different play styles worth every penny for a bug free and enjoyable game
early access reviewdo not buyin its current state even as an early access title bless is not worth its pricetag the game crashes unexpectedly and has some of the worst optimization i have ever seen not to mention the translations are garbage god forbid you get stuck on a loading screen or run into problems while playing as steam is not issuing refunds regardless of playtime anymore so if you exceed two hours youre screwed check back in a couple months and see if it is fixed andor still alive
this might be the only time to actually waste money on this game considering the seventy off otherwise the amount of money spent on this game just to collect cars and tracks is ridiculous for what you end up with compared to their older titles and hate to through in consoles but fm and gt games then not to mention the upcoming project cars which im part of and is in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guys are putting into their new game project cars
its clear that on the developers list of priorities the games features and ability to engage took second place to how it would be monetised some of the worst habits of game publishers are on display here and to add insult to injury the game theyre corrupting here wasnt really worth paying for in the first place full review http www html
this is the sequel to the first big 3d mmorpg and i really like it its part of that world of warcraft generation of mmo s much like lotrorift and wow but with alot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much this game is fantasy turned up to eleven
in the chaotic month since the overhaul sparkypants has shown to the community that they do listen to our feedback and and that they are trying to fix as many issues with the new client as they possibly can
early access reviewafter the new update this game suckssssss im curently lv one hundred and six and a beta player it was fun but after the loot update they made it where you cant earn money you have to get boxes to sell the loot for fourteen of its original value
early access reviewi enjoy the game and its been slowly getting better performance wise and it feels like it has a lot of potential i put these issues down in hope that the dev team will fix them no official forum just links to steam community hub need a feedback forum so theyre aware of problems wolf noises howling out marta are so excessive its annoying i havnt seen a repair warning at all plus you cant do it below level thirteen dont understand some of the quests arnt very explicit skill window doesnt really explain initially how to equip skills and terminology like the use of mount rather then equip is weird enhancing and upgrading companions isnt really explicitly explained how to get guild levels guild exp and how many members you can have per level isnt explained emotes arnt visible stones the gatherable are very rare lol the publishers dont seem very involved when people level people dont know to do hunting quests the interface i feel like is causing a bit of lag i did some suggested ini fix that made the game lagg so much less though i still have spontanious fps drop dont understand why you cant use flight paths in areas your story hasnt reached yet unsure what the requirments are for pets to give buffs no stamina bar for when you sprint there are just some little problems leaving open doors to lack of information some weird balancing some unconventionality etc it can be a little problematic but i do feel like this game has great potential if they made good choices in development
hello all i am known as sinth cyntherea bucktucker and persephone in this community i have played the fssb series since its inception in north america history of freestyle en wikipedia orgin late two thousand and sixs i started playing the sierra online alpha version when it hit north america i was instantly hooked the pace of this game and the intricicies involved in pro play are what keeps me engaged we cannot compare this version of freestyle with the versions that came before it so i will review fssb2 on its own merits review this is a f2p game you dont have to pay anything to get started and you dont have to pay anything to be pro create your character power forward center small forward shooting guard point guard it helps to have a basic understanding of basketball to understand what these positions mean you get a few default characters with different stats based on position their are special characters or spcs that you can buy with real money that have enhanced stats what some people fail to realize is that if you are a free player that means not spending you get a free spc at level fifty so no you dont have to pay to get a special character people that play this game are gonna say quot sinthbuck what about having to pay for extra skill slots yes extra skill slots cost my answer is that if you wantneed those then you are already high enough level or dedicated enough to need them you can absolutely play without spending money i have several alts that dont spend a dime and do just fine now the the f2pp2p thing is out of the way onto the game this is an arcadey street basketball game with cartoony graphics and has an urban flavor if you like fast paced sports action and have a need for twitch reflexology then i cant recommend this game enough if you hate childish racist ageist im forty years old smacktalk uh look elsewhere the community is harsh most of the community is 20ish some older most younger and most very immature please dont let them get to you apparantly irl people talk trash on the court i dont get it because i dont hoop irl and havent since the early 1990s anyway graphics 610cartoony characters weird looking pets pets give you to attributes odd outfitssound six hundred and ten i turn off in game music and run pandora in the background people like to spam their emotes btw guys super annoying gameplay nine hundred and ten this game is all about timing coordination and using skills wisely it gets it right pfs are op but meh i main pf the classes are fun and true to their real life counterparts fun factor one hundred and ten its not a lot of fun to play with a its fun to play with people that at least try dont be an elitist and you will have more fun i currently have three level 50s three more toons in pro around level forty and several other stragglers hit me up ingame and seek out team bruh if you are looking for a crew clubclan i will be in rookie on a c i look forward to seing you all and have funalso i have always played with a controller i do not play with a keyboard if you can i am amazed signedbucktucker teambruh
early access reviewlove the graphics didnt have time to experience everything but havent seen any major bugs although the game freezes sometimes after i jump to different sectors
idk why people dont recommend it like microtransaction even tho this game is completely f2p which is great and me myself dont relize time goes by while playing this and this point i dont even know wh y iplay this simple game but i keep on playing it until like five am no sleep
takes some time to get used to and master it but its all worth it the pvp kills of all type cas dogfight all feel so rewarding and dont forget this is the best military fighter jets simulator
can you please stop banning my communications like sure i chewed out a player but feedback should help i would not recommend this gane to new people and snowflakes the company is a bunch of liberal snowflakes i had this game on mobile four years ago when everything was better i remember the following friendly fire for the noobs trying to steal kills on full hp tank destroyer friendly mapsplusminus two tier matchaking general chat where noobs can be noobs and stay out of battlesedit ok so take out all chat bans and the player base is restored please for the love of god tell the company they are dying quicker than pokemon go this game was intended for people over eighteen and oh boy their feelings get hurt so easily they boast about reporting anyone like checkmate kid i win by proving you suck and need to uninstall war thunder is more friendly to people who like to curse and apparently this game needs to be taken off steam for sucking so bad and being censorship heavy if you say plzzz its censored
this game has its quirks but i forgot how there is nothing like it and it just feels amazing with the sound up yeah there are laggy bits yeah it doesnt seem like the dev team has testing infrastructure inplace to reliably update the game but hey its unique and i love it
early access reviewif you enjoy getting hit through walls and an everchanging balancing system that involves nerfing bad abilities and weapons and buffing the already good ones then this is the game for you its free try it if you like it enjoy it i think ill give it a little while before i go back to it to let the dust settle
good game but like any mmorpg you will find yourself grinding to gain item drops then sell those drops for ingame currency to buy what you need game gets repetitive fast but pvp makes up for that but to do well in pvp you need high end accessories and unique grade gear
this game used to be very good i have hundreds of hours beyond what steam says back when this game didnt have steam release i quit because the economy became terrible due to gaijins greed i came back to see if anything had changed but no everything has become even worse than it was before the economy is still broken research is painful and flightmodel still sucks not to mention the matchmaking all these things have been discussed on the official forums with very good posts showing graphs and everything but gaijin doesnt listen to the players stay away from this game
great game but to really like it youve really got to play it you cant understand the game well unless you play it if you do play it you will understand the concepts of this great game
