infestation survivor stories was by far my favourite game back in the day minus the cheaters infestation new has brought back memories old friends and just a great player versus player game in general with new independent developers that had nothing to do with the old scams i am enjoying this game to the moon and back its sad to see people give out bad reviews because they are either a bad at the game or a thinking its the same old deus done listen to the spam negative reviews check for the honest reviews
faithful people of the tsar today is a terrifying day for all of nova europa following our great leaders attempt to broker a peace between the american union and australasia we were suddenly and brutally assailed at approximately three am western europa time nuclear bombs were dropped across the west coast and even on the far eastern coast as well notable cities that have been confirmed bombed are amsterdam paris london berlin warsaw vienna vilnius and even minsk however it is wonderful to report that our ever alert air force have stopped at least three bombs prepared to drop on vladivostok post and madrid in the past few hours it has also been confirmed that american paratroopers have dropped in ireland england and even the belgian coast our troops are already moving to position and our might shall be proven once more
early access review one rocket that four hundred and fifty credits please thanks now have a nice day you basically spent thirteen of the credits your going to earn this match from that one rocket and it takes about three to kill a tank so enjoy earning absolutely nothing this match its obvious that this game promotes paying to win or grinding all day to get a single weapon trust me about this look how many hours i spent playing this trash you spend more time grinding in this game than actually playing it not worth spending any time playing this just go and play world war two online its the same except theirs no where near the grinding and the game is one huge map what takes hours to walk from one side to the other seriously its the most realistic war game ever instead of the same six maps over and over
this game was good actually best game ever but now i were delete its because seven hundred suck as she user interface she map she spawn rune she new hero she actually everything she this is defense of the ancients two int it no its not this is fucking terrible game for fucking girls and kids i have to looked at your fucking small user interface that ruined my fucking eyeballs new update is suck it seem like laugh out loud i spent nineteen thousand eight hundred and eighty eight hours in defense of the ancients two but when seven hundred came here i was excite and then i wasted my thirty minutes and time to say good bye vivace a
game sucks everything is expensive buy things one shot snipers everywhere tanks everywhere and the anti tank guns drains your funds takes forever to gain fund if you want to play this game join germany they are the overpowered ones
the deus continue to ruin this game with their consistent poorly executed patches they've turned what used to be a fast paced action packed flight game into a tortuous grind to get new planes and then more grind to max out the features each plane has engine power guns ammo ordinance etc the mods are far too heavy handed with their chat bans if you say a word they done agree with or talk about anything other than plane the game itself you stand a good chance of being muzzled for variable durations at their whim and mood too many of the other players are either forced to be self entered greedy little psychopaths or for whatever reason are just maladjusted human flotsam that choose to play against the team the objectives or just cause grief and mayhem at every opportunity the game itself is really amazing if you have all the time in the world and the patience of a saint you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it for awhile good luck
just a great game if you love never winter i like the fact that i can play with my nine year old grandson and now he wants to play table top do when i was young you where told that you would go to hell for playing these types of games i truly believe it has opened my grandsons eyes to a world that feeds his imagination while schooling him in match i give this game an a along with eve online
this game is awesome here is my session in a nutshell join match die twenty times kill someone gets happy and dies again repeat game does get a little lady at really intense battles but most of the time its good great game get it its freebee epee
heroes generals is a game with much potential or rather had much potential a while ago hell id even say the game is quite good but its the developers and the insane grind that ruin this game if you want any info on why the deus are completely awful i reckon you can just read another review that is negative and see what i mean but the reason this game was ruined for me personally was the insane grind that comes with the game this game is not free to play its pay to win and that a shame because the core concept of the game is good its a shame that the developers and completely unable to do anything good to the game thanks for reading
i love this and done even really know why hama its kinda like when everybody had fires or when everybody had those digital pet things back in the a i guess the combination of micromanaging resources as well as inventory management quests and dweller training management keeps it fun enough for me to want to check back in a few times a day for like three thousand and forty minutes to do random crap i played this in beta through bethesda launcher a lot more than i have through steam but back then it was missing a lot of the cooler features it has now like the branching quests and stuff i thought that was a great addition and several of the dialogue options i had when stumbling a cross a random quest in the wasteland were actually better than dialogue options info at least that what i thought but hey in just some random good who doesn't know crap about that kinda stuff this game is awesome up until your base gets rest by death laws and all your dwellers are dead and you done have enough caps to revive them at that point i think its pretty normal to rage quit and promise yourself you'll never play this stupid addictive game again as long as you still have breath only to return the next day and do it all over again done ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever pay for the lunchboxes the wonders of personal computer gaming make it so lunch boxes are still accessible without paying a dime if that how you want to play some people may find it more interesting to get everything the hard way and there absolutely nothing wrong with that just have fun and done spend your hard earned cash on micro transactions that are completely superfluous may
early access reviewing tried this game and it is actually great good things about it it is similar to counter strike global offensive with the keybinding and stuff ranking system good aim and yea probably loads of other good stuff bad things when you buy the arm or which gives a fifty defense then buy twenty five defense one you get the twenty five defense one and loses fifty which should be fixed limo a should either get seventy five or a windows appearing saying you already own this it center also when you die your weapon should drop and you have to rebut them from the shop makes the game more challenging and fun although i know its early access but still thanks for me great game still
at first i didst understand why so many people hated this game when i first launched it it made me sign up for an account it was a bit of an inconvenience but not horrible i entered a server and the loading time took around two minutes so then i thought well if it takes this long to load it must have stunning graphics right no the trees leaves looked smudged the grass was just a single color and the sky want that bad okay maybe the character animations are good i said yeti took a swim and the regular swim animation is fine not very realistic but fine but then i pressed shift you break into a buggy animation where you become an unrealistic amazing olympic swimmer the sound effects that go with it are also extremely annoying okay once i find some items it will be more fun mini want able to find any items because i was obliterated by a guy half a mile away from me on top of a tower well a a a a a i say at least ill re spawn instantly you have to wait three minutes to re spawn in a game you'll most likely die fairly often if you want to spawn back in instantly you have to use just thinking about makes me sick to my stomach you have to use in game currency at this point in so fed up i uninstall it as fast as would uninstall again
a fun game to get into for the air combat however the ground combat leaves something to be desired as you will be constantly one showed i know that the game is men to be realistic however the rendering range for the ground is tenable air combat is good overall however i would advise you look away from arcade battles and more into realistic in arcade the person with the most bigger guns is usually the winner only other grid with the game is micro transactions and a pay to win model
time to update the review and it will be negative developers proved themselves compared to dire wolf the new update ruined the performance of the game not to mention the glitches you ruined the game completely
currently my favourite game really fun mob with normal movement tips camera skill shots and a hello lot of fun it int pay to win you can get the normal currency very easily by playing logging in and you can get gems aka the premium currency by logging in doing certain promotional stuff thanatos i a a a king love you
early access review wonderful graphic with great and simple system also good daily event says also its not that hard to buy new ships much better balkans than in other popular massively multiplayer online vehicle games just try if you like of a
one of the best free games i ever played in this kind of games when i first started playing it i wouldn't have thought that it was much for the world but after several hours behind it i could just say that this game got me hooked it is not a pay to win game you could spend money on it but its just not worth it since you will end up with things you really want after a couple of hours behind it what you do need is a good team on the battlefield and you will success with almost everything the only bad things that comes too my mind when i am writing this is that auto balance some times split party too get more even teams we should at least have been giving an option for if we want to be spliced or not some minor bugs has comes out on the newest patch but the developers of the game is already working on a fix for it
the latest update module six marked the demise of never winter the often pts mpg is now far characters are nerved and opponents buffed in an attempt to get you to buy too much too soon too bad
digital combat simulator world is a great sim however it does have a huge learning curve for those who like the hard core sim where every button and switch is modelled in the aircraft look no further lucky for people who a rent so hard core there is the flaming cliffs three module although this module still takes a bit to figure out how to use the planes some you tube kids and some button mapping to a good quality joystick and do fighting is a blast flaming cliffs three adds the of fifteen eagle sushi us twenty seven these planes are pretty easy to fly you done have to pull twenty switches to fire a cannon after playing a bit in flaming cliffs three and finally getting the hang of radar and beyond is fighting i found digital combat simulator flaming cliffs three to be and enjoyable and challenging sim dodging heat seekers by dropping flares and pulling hard a force turns only to have the missile pass beneath the belly of the aircraft by a factor of meters is such a rush and then winning your first air victory and then your first combat sortie is something that instills a sort of pride in you old digital combat simulator world modules like a black shark two and other stand alone planes are more suited to the hard core players even though there is a game mode its not very well explained flaming cliffs three with a small amount of learning can be a rewarding and fun module for the sim junkie is look up youtube tutorials as they tend to explain how to use the systems better i found this one helped a lot with the ftp wow youtube co watch however done try to learn it all at once you wont remember and become frustrated
this game is like a celebrations chocolate tin looks nice on the outside but has a sewing kit inside what i done understand how this game mechanic micro transaction menu and general artificial intelligence is worst than sim raceway which is just about dead captain picard face palm
i love this game as someone who hates how most personal computer games speed the user interface all over my big one thousand two hundred pixel resolution monitor its nice to have a game which makes everything big and close enough that i done have to worry about looking at the game i also have tons of money and hate how most games only allow me to spend it on the base game this game has no such issue and its loading screens tell me about all the best things to spend my money on rant time i hate how so many personal computer games these days have all these fancy and confusing options menus all the massive textures filling up my hard drives all the audio sliders and color blind modes who cares about color blind mode i hate it i hate it all its confusing and takes up too much hard drive space rant over but seriously guys the only thing i done like about this game is that they got the stupid voice actor from the movie and hes everywhere in the tutorial the options menus a rent confusing only five options may the textures are small and compressed to minimize hard disk drive space and i can spend my money as much as i want and ill never run out of things to buy would play sheep football again
early access review before i start i would like to say that i am not trying to hate if you like the game how it is now that is totally in your hands and is fantastic for you i liked the game i think it was a year ago that i played it for the first time i had seen my friends play it and when i got in i had massive amounts of fun and it was one of the games that got me into the entire gaming thing after a while i stopped playing i was never someone who plays a game for more than a month after a while i came back there was a massive update they said so i went online and searched the community was raging so i start the game i see that levels are now used for items it annoys me i played together with my friends and my friends played for far longer but i had the highest level because somehow i for far more kills so now the game would be too easy for one of us or too hard for someone else i quit and now i came back when my friend said that game had updated again they had removed the weird level thing but in staid of that they had installed another weird system you now have loot soon that means that its like destiny now i have nothing against destiny but i done really like the loot system well i think they should take the game back to the beta version back when levels where for blocks currency for blocks and tech points still existed cons one weird irritating challenge ratings random loot three pay to win cons for players that played the beta one you have to build an entire new robot all money is gone new play styles too much new weapons very different progress system tops one a lot of customization the actual battle moments are good more than one weapon sort on one robot conclusion well if you are a new player i would say you should try it if you are a beta player you are in for a shock the game now has so many weapons that everybody has his own play style that said i am still using a modified version of my old vehicle and i am doing of the thing is that you will almost never stumble into a game where people work together because everyone has different weapons and if you want to build a robot you will have to slowly build it up by the round
this is a very fun game that i would recommend to anyone used to not play this game very often it just didst seem interesting to me not one bit but then i slowly began to start playing it more and more and now in hooked and i just love it the characters the playable classes the maps the game modes its nothing but hours of endless fun sure you'll come across hackers every once in a while and being put on a team with terrible teammates int exactly uncommon but all the negative stuff aside this game is amazing even if you done like shooter games give this game a chance it originally want my thing but now its my favourite game there are a lot of things you can do in it including taunts with the playable classes and along with that they re all different which distinct cosmetics hats and so on they also have their own personalities as shown in the meet the team videos on youtube but if you re interested in the actual game rather than the characters just done search them up live played each class at least once and yet its still really fun to experiment with them because there are plenty of things live never done before with each of them as for game modes well there a ton of them meaning that if you dislike one there will be one you'll like game modes include payload control points man versus machine it center there are only a couple of problems with this game that i think are worth putting into this review the first one being matchmaking the weird way that servers are done i hope for this to undone in the future the second problem int with the game itself but with the player base but i understand that there no way to control people and people are going to be rude no matter what online game you re playing the main reason i put the second one is because its common to come across twelve year old kids that are too young to even be playing this game screaming swear words into their microphones but just mute them and all is good overall get this game but as i said earlier its nothing but hours of endless fun
eth good at start but when at about level thirty or so it just starts to get boring as heck and one other thing to get chests the easy way is for wasting your on stupid chests that a rent even good at all also never and i mean never get this piece of junk you call a game
early access review this game int a game its a chore once you make something you feel good it has a problem a few minutes later you think you fix it then another problem arises its an infinite loop of chores and annoyance and it never even gives you any stats for anything or any way to tell what something does live probably spent more time on this games discussion board asking how something works more than i have playing the game here is an example of one of the crappy description queen bee she needs things to be just so before she gets the drones working there no explanation to what just so is supposed to mean how are we supposed to know what we have to do to get it to work the swords and armours have no stats so we can never tell how much more armoured and powerful we will repro the atmosphere in caves is nice pretty good graphics the creatures look gordon bad physics my character flies like a bouncy ball on a trampoline boring repetitive game played optimization is another cube based creation adventure game god awful item descriptions
war thunder is a game that allows you to command planes tanks or other ground vehicles like trucks and eventually naval vessels in player versus player and ave matches the selection of vehicles you have range from are world war two usually around the time of the spanish civil war all the way up to the korean war and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the us a germany user britain and japan at the moment japan only has aircraft but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too there could possibly be more nations added in the future but not much info has been provided on that additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations the game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches these are arcade realistic and simulator arcade battles are the most popular enemy name tags appear when in your line of sight mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a coloured marker appears when you re aiming at an enemy with the three different color green yellowed indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate realistic battles has realistic mobility characteristics though not at the same level of simulator mode limited markers name tags still appear but the lead circle and the coloured marker are gone and realistic team matchup you wont see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode simulator mode does what realism mode does but takes it up to eleven you can only view your plane from inside the cockpit some of the cockpit interiors a rent out yet but you still get some kind of first person view nonetheless and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield the player versus player portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets generally the role of attacker bombers and destroy enemy planes generally the role of in the common ground strike mode there are also the game modes domination which involves landing on air fields to capture them and air domination where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone the more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives like the attacking side is helping an artificial intelligence ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them tank variety in objective types int much better which are usually just capture and hold points on the map this is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavy highlight tanks spa armoured trucks regular trucks with mounted machine guns user ply the realistic modes objectives done change much for ground forces but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time the ave portion of the game can be done solo or with friends at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content the ave content includes single missions where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective dynamic campaign where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map and historical battles which you have to buy with the steam pack or in game which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cut scenes added though there doesn't seem to be much of a point to doing these ave activities because they done provide much of a reward which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game the grind this game is very grind heavy especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription if you really want to try out the jets you re going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game but i can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play all of the vehicles are very well designed while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practising and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle you re facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight the game int pay to win either well i guess that depends on what your definition of pay to win is most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics or speeding up game progression the only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew which improves the performance of your vehicle but if you re willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew while this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games in my opinion it int the absolute best if you want that go for digital combat simulator world if you decide to play this i would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there done try to rush to the end game because it int that great if you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments just try to have fun in the end this review ended up being much longer than i expected May
the game has a great concept i however found it hard to play as many times as it crashed froze i have a decent gaming computer this was unacceptable it was completely unplayable for friends but from what i could actually play it was fun i wish it was better
early access review alright listen here folks it was a good match all was well five kills then i go and loot this body and in on the ground then i try to stand up logically by pressing a like all games then i was killed this has happened three times and in very disappointed serious review the game is fun and all but the animation character movement and control is absolute when i aim i done expect for the camera and the gun to be flying over the place like princess lea in that one scene of star wars were she turns into a space fairy and flies off the graphics are alright but its not really treated well with the camera movement when you are in first person you can barely control yourself and in third person you feel as if you are trying to move in a giant in soup ladle filed with grease and russian man juices one thousand and ten is a mas apiece baby
early access review great game if you re into sci i and mobs totally paid for it even tho it is free to support the developers id love to see this game have more content in the future
although its kinda different from the game i remember this game is lit of definitely recommend to everyone who loved yugo as a kid never thought id go back to loving yugo the original voice actors voicing everything makes it a more nostalgic much love to dan green and his family plus never add synchro monsters or anything from is or passed that by i done know from there lao
avoid at all costs if you can even get the registration to work trove requires you to register with and use a separate launcher which at registration asks for a bunch of details that no game on steam should need using the registration link from the launcher doesn't work it opens a registration page in your default browser which doesn't actually do anything and will not allow you to register if you use firefox it wont even have the input boxes labeled correctly if you go to the effort of actually tracking down a registration page that will actually do something when you click the submit button you will only be successful if you have given them enough information to sell your details for advertising including giving them an unsecured email address that can be easily spammed if you try to use any kind of secure email forwarder or even a more secure email provider like my they will not allow you to register at all a free game is not free is i have to sell my soul to play it and any game that demands i not use an email address because it has decent spam protection is not a game i want anything to do with
this game is a petra dish an environment for which the vilest and most putrid of gamers can thrive and cultivate to their hearts content i walked into this world unsuspecting and walked right back out changed scarred by the soviet fires and new meta revolutions i would favour my eyes being scooped out viscous with one of those a flurry spoons than spend further time drowning in this cesspool of a free to play game unfortunately i still need my eyes in order to investigate this growing red menace and further stop the lads stains and evans from further infiltrating the steam network and send them right back to the a mines from which they spawned terrible joe mccarthy had the right idea
the game in general is really fun and it captures the spirit of blooms wonderfully unfortunately its overshadowed by the absolute terrible balancing the game has the game has two main modes attack mode or defense mode attack mode allows you to send blooms at your foe for money and you will receive increased money per turn defense mode is just you going head to head with someone without sending the blooms attack mode is probably most popular and the best mode in my opinion its really great to select your towers for the game and plan out what you'll do and send certain blooms at your enemy depending on the towers they have you can only choose three types of blooms and you can get a random one for energy this int too bad but it does often feel like you done quite have enough blooms to cover all your bases there are two big issues in my eyes with attack mode its simply too easy to place one or two towers that can deal with the easy blooms at the start and save up the large amount of money to get the massive red blimp since this would still be relatively close to the start of the game there no way you can defend against this and its normally a game over its not always even a red blood people can just flood you with a ton of blooms or even just higher level blooms you can defend against this more or less but depending on your setup it can easily overwhelm you this also leads to having to be very specific you have blooms to defend against these since you re only allowed three four towers the next big issue i see with attack mode is directly from the game once you get to around round thirty two they start sending an insane amount of powerful blooms at you this wouldn't be a problem if you actually had the finances map space or upgrades to actually deal with them but more often than not you just done defense mode is just laughable in attack mode you start off with making two hundred and fifty after some amount of seconds defense mode only gives you seventy to start with that wouldn't be a problem if they adjusted the tower cost or the blood difficulty but its exactly the same patterns as attack mode there are far too many blooms for the speed at which you can upgrade your blooms you can buy money return upgrades but the lowest tier gives you an extra two per turn for fifty that a crazy amount of money when you re only getting seventy each time besides the two game modes there are lots of different events some of which are payt play they allow you to play special events once per day or you can get a membership to play it all the time you also do not have access to all towers and tower upgrades at the start you unlock the ability to purchase them by winning games you purchase them with coins in game which you can get either by paying with real money or various random methods in game this game is super great for playing with friends though unless you play against random people you wont have any towers or upgrades aside from the base ones you start out with its just super frustrating to play mainly because of the terrible balancing its free so id recommend trying it out for yourself and see what you think but as a good game i cannot really recommend it
early access review well the game is what it is a three dimensional version of adventure quest worlds the same simplistic massively multiplayer online role playing game game play and the same monetization with guardian upgrade and currency you have to buy with real life money some stuff is lock behind the guardian and the special currency mostly been cosmetic boost that let you skip some of the sluggish grind and transformation than let you move faster than normal i can to recommend the game mostly because of the heavy grind to get anything but if you got time don to mind the grind or throwing money at them sure go ahead but personally all i can said is a okay game wait at least until it leave early access
i am never a great fan of the fourth edition mechanics in dungeons and dragons but never winter has managed to convince me that it works as an action role playing game in a persistent massively multiplayer online setting never winter is strongly based on the never winter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy massively multiplayer online role playing game game play together with fresh tried and tested approach from star trek online and champions online while i am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like granada esp ada and maple story cryptic unique approach of astral diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players however i do question the motive and causality of making astral diamonds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place another feature borrowed from cryptic other games is the introduction of the boundary a virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy there are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players this feature is powerful enough to recreate entire dungeon and dragon modules written for table top play to exist in never winter like star trek online i am really cautious in approaching this game at this stage never winter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics but cryptic has demonstrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem dungeons and dragons in the massively multiplayer online role playing game market
in short pay to win game pay to get much better cards that can flat you out like truck hitting a bug its fun and game play really based on your own style however in order to win you need to have the best cards at least much better than your opponent so basically to obtain these cards manually is to use your own money or obtainable hardly thru in game diamond currency obtainable it seems very unfair when someone has one or two better card than you easily destroys well planned strategy just because they have that one card no one has obtained point is you need very good card in order to win another player your basic or normal cards wont do but the thing is you can get those cards by pouring as much money as you want to obtain fast and easy cards then you can win against other players who have less good cards than yours in a word its a bit pay to win if you play for competitive mode against real players but if you play casually for fun or nostalgic visits this game might be good warning there a difference when fighting versus pc and player there will be a huge gap fishing pc is like fighting a toddler who knows nothing and very straightforward whereas fighting real player is like you fighting a world championship pfc fighter where they use combos to beat you down and you cant do about it and because your gloves are made of cotton and his are made of spiky steel and will beat you down and you will be stunned all the way
where to begin the graphics are crap there int even an option to turn them up or down its just permanently locked turd vision speaking of options character customization is absolute there are like two choices of hair and two choices of face both of which look as hell there are multiple bugs through the game and they a rent major except for the part where the mission you re on spontaneously terminates and you cant move forward i was really looking forward to playing in the hated universe and i understand that this is targeted at kids but mon this is two thousand and fourteen this game plays like it just came out for the nintendo sixty four did you really release a game like this and expect no one to notice not to mention it takes so long for you to actually ride your beloved dragon i didst even get to the point where i can actually ride it but i imagine it would be less like the movies and more like superman sixty our for anyone who remembers that game this should not be considered a complete game not even beta for that matter this is someone wiping there on a keyboard and somehow managing to write code that produces a barely functional program and deciding to publish his wipe eye to steam furthermore you have to pay to delete a character and there is only one character slot honestly whf speaking of pay micro transactions micro transactions everywhere there is also a paid subscription option which unlocks for you an experience similar to that of eating turd fla cored ice cream with sprinkles and caramel done bother with this game
a just a the people that pay win its that simple in your early games you are gonna see people with upgrades and they will stomp you they will steal your soul you will fri you will die
why the would i need auto update in the region of the world where internet connection is drastically limited why the is there no option to disable any update for digital combat simulator world i purchased the game i have the right to play that version anywhere i want offline
in going to preface this by saying live only played three mos including this one and none for more than six hours i really wanted to like this as a huge forgotten realised fan but the combat is truly dreadful and there not enough detail from the onset to make me want to go further from a more technical aspect the graphics are mediocre but then they were obviously set up to accommodate low end machines the audio is below par and the controls though not terrible could be mich better especially where the camera comes in to play
this game is probably the only massively multiplayer online i have really enjoyed and have wanted to immerse myself in and it did just that the interface is spot on amazing i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys investing their time to complete loads of dungeons a friendly environment and a good character levelling up system especially a brilliant story in sure there more that will be added to this review as i go through the game more and more otherwise gather some friends or siblings who love to game in this style and join the adventure its absolutely amazing
its amazing how every single patch they release the game just gets more in broken not to mention ninety of the player base is toxic and dumb there will never be a time when this game is good stay the hell away from this trash of and did i mention why of did they give thoth a stun on his escape an escape that takes you from earth to neptune
early access review hour playtime builders review note feel free to skip my backstory and head straight to the pros and congas someone who put a lot of time into min craft a very similar game and stopped playing for a while after the project lost my interest creatives did not really call to me at first after running out of steam for my usual casual multiplayer however i was coaxed into giving it a go it was either that or min craft and there are only so many times one can re download min craft and opt fine and get connected textures working with your desired aesthetic before you start to scream regardless of my hesitancy i jumped headfirst into a surprisingly pleasant few hours after giving myself some time to explore the world fighting mechanics power mining building and exploring all but one layer of the world i can safely say that creatives is a step in the right direction for the block sandbox game genre especially where building is concerned ill focus on that aspect for my forty hour playtime review as i primarily craft and build in addition to being a fan of building and games i am also an artist with a background in graphic design if some of this comes across as more of an art critique or design notes that would be why hope fellow builders find this review helpful pros lots of blocks to discover and craft all blocks can be rotated this includes furniture lighting it center unlock able crafted blocks are unlocked in crafting trees via discovering and crafting no guessing the recipes either the recipes are available in your crafting menu as long as you have unlocked that particular tree or picked up the recipe in a chest while exploring textures are beautiful detailed seriously though check out some of the textures on the wiki from fancy diamond doors to subtle obsidian ore they really gave it their all in that department that being said in not completely satisfied with the textures and ill explain that in the cons section homes are very atmospheric and come with their own ambiance through the audio visuals and mechanics the dripping from the cave ceiling really gives spelunking that extra boost of excitement biome also have their own region specific creatures of both docile and hostile varieties mistakes honestly i feel like making mistakes and experimenting with building done put as much of a dent on your mining tools and resources as playing around in min craft survival does there are no pick axes in creatives instead you have a glove with different levels of mining cells they can be expensive to make but they last a lot longer cons crafting tree textures i love the crafting trees the system not the flora i love that crafting a block unlocks other recipes i do not however like how blocks of the same recipe class look next to each other wood for example has several block types that i would like to use together as the base of a build wood half slabs wood stairs wood walls the wood stairs are textured in a very high contrast way and are definitely in a different hue than the wood half slabs wood half slabs use a subtle wood floor texturing while the wood walls have very little texture at all together it looks like kind of weird mesh of textures like three different artists on three different projects designed them and set them side by side not a lot of textures look good next to each other and a lot of blocks feel high in contrast i have trouble getting particular builds to work especially when going for a rustic nordic feel obsidian to me is the biggest letdown i would have liked to use it as a darker metal framework for things but the block is too saturated and edging towards a dark purple instead of a more neutral feel that said the limestone tree has some gorgeous blocks and i really enjoy building with those half slabs i thought half slabs in min craft were the bane of my existence but surprisingly they do one simple thing that makes all the difference in the world compared to these little buggers min craft half labs stack on top of each other and creatives half slabs done this goes for any other block you attempt to place on a bottom set half slab in creatives setting half slabs on the top half of the block space is super easy with the rotate function however not being able to put a half lab down to fill the gap under a stair or to break up a repetitive pattern in the wall is super annoying for building they are basically only good for crafting covering the floor and a few decoration touches very few compared to if they stacked whats on fire torches cant catch trees on fire they cant catch wood on fire they cant catch me on fire but my hay roof went down in the blink of an eye why the gods were as displeased about the half slab discovery on my roof as i was apparently monster spawns monster spawning is a bit odd in this game live seen rock lobsters on time out in one times one squares in the wall live seen night piss falling from the heavens lighting up the night sky in their blue dying fire nearly every hour my friend and i have to play wheres the mir in our underground base because somewhere deep in the wall there is a one times one open space that a monster or two will spawn in a purr at us until we kill it and seal the hole more of a note than anything if you use too many natural blocks that have not being crafted after being mined there is a chance that monsters can spawn in that area my friends and i learned that the hard way after dying several times behind closed doors during bathroom breaks you have been warned conclusion all in all i have had fun in creatives so far both as a builder and as an adventurer there are a lot of builds that i want to try in a lot of different biome i have a lot of hope for this game its in early access still and my main complaints are just things that could build this good game into a great one if you have some time and you haven already give creatives a shot especially if you are someone who enjoys unlocking materials and creating there are some bugs worth noting which i have detailed separately in the steam discussion boards for creatives but i have a feeling they will be fixed in due time hope this was helpful to fellow imaginative minds happy building
if you are looking for online plane battles than stop looking this the game you want if you are deciding between world of warplanes and war thunder choose this it has better graphics better tech tree better flying better beatles and its more realistic also the game is lots of fun nine thousand nine hundred and ten
early access review in preaching to the choir here i almost re downloaded this game after not playing for maybe a year i figured i would check the recent comments first since i saw that recently it had a ton of negative reviews needless to say in glad i didst waste my time sad to see such a awesome concept of a game go to complete waste on this free to play marketing scheme i hope someone copies the concept of this game and succeeds greater than these fat cats ever could've
early access review no limit on blocks required for some guns makes the balance terrible if you enjoy one shooting someone from the sky while being unreachable this is for you if you enjoy tactical play avoid side note for items to be made the game requires you to sell recycle items you gain at the end of matches out of random loot boxes this wouldn't be so bad if the majority of the loot want cubes that sell for one of the in game currency even if you get a diamond box purple and gold loot sell for two hundred thousand five hundred of yeah top guns cost one hundred and forty two thousand of said currency per one this used to be such a good game i have around two thousands hours off steam via the standalone i downloaded it and played for a bit just to tell you all its complete
love this game so many things you can do in it like fishing or fireball frenzy and you can train multiple dragons if you have diamonds i haven seen any bugs or glitches in the game as well if you love how to train your dragon you must get this game
easily gets outshine by other games too grind the grind int rewarding quests are uninteresting and even annoying to complete the combat system and character customization are pretty rad done know what else to say about this its a waste of time even if you re rich
planet side two is by no means perfect choppy performance sometimes and lag spikes but by the nine is it fun herrera future battles in which each class plays an important role snipers take out dug in targets while calling out possible dangers light foot soldiers run around causing havoc heavy and maps are the hard hitters whilst medics and ennis keep the troops and vehicles going i feel this game can only get better
let me start by saying i used to frequent this location often the service is normally great and on any other day of the week i could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip however since the new change in management the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared i can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff to say the new waiters and chefs are unbearable is an understatement the new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children when my family and i went in this evening for dinner no one moved to greet or seat us until about fifteen minutes after we arrived i spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar i eventually cleared my throat and asked is it seat yourself today then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said actually no its not she proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us after scratching her in front of me my wife and our three children she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house looking at the menu i could see her greasy hand print remaining twenty minutes later a waitress approached us did not say a word started writing on her pad and then just walked away she came back five minutes later with five glasses of water none of which had ice she blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again five minutes after that another waitress came out this time she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening when we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff she assured us next time we come back we can expect better service she got us more menus wiped down the table and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table things finally seemed to start turning around after we placed our order we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant the carpets were new there was music playing and the tables when clean were quite comfortable for a moment we thought were in the clear just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve it was ruined again we heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff several people who sounded quite young were shouting do it do it immediately i was alarmed there were not many people seated at the restaurant i could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped the first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food all of them hiding a grin my wife looked alarmed my children were oblivious i said thank you but they didst walk away my wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich but i stopped her i picked up it and opened it the three standing beside our table started looking nervous something wrong sir the second waitress asked suppose were going to find out i responded i opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich most languages done have the words to concisely describe the taste but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt i spat up the food immediately i stood up pushed the three aside grabbed my family and left the manager heard the commotion and made his way to us i cant believe myself but i simply gave him the middle finger right in front of my children and proceeded out of the restaurant in the car ride home i kept wincing at the aftertaste it was strangely familiar it was driving me crazy trying to think of what they might have put in it i considered going to the emergency room in case it was a poison of some sort i didst go to see a doctor and felt fine after a shower and something to eat from home i longed for the old owner and staff i detested the vindictive people who were currently at that restaurant i wish the best for those old waiters and waitresses who got out of there while they could in the end the whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth but not nearly as bad as the one left by team fortress two
of heres the real story yes you need a membership to hunt all animals but you can try the game for free and hunt mule deer with a rifle they give you for free if you like the game then fine you can order a thirty six or yearly memberships and its fairly cheep the bigger the membership you order the more free stuff you get i ordered a six month membership and got everything i think id need to play forever in guns anyways if you have to collect everything in game yes it gets expensive but why do it a shotgun can hunt anything anything in game because it has three kinds of ammo there are fancy guns with engraving for people who need those but never for free doh and several types of bows and arrows and sights scopes it center and on and on but you done need all that for less than the cost of lottery tickets you can play all year long and hunt every animal you ever wanted in great detailed forests and on cold slowly mountains no its not all free but trying it out is so try it or leave it no problem but its a good game just not what many people hoped for
early access review this game is really really good although it doesn't really bring anything new on the table it managed to create solid balance and interactions on its own and i would definitely recommend it as an alternative to mtg this game could be the next big tag if more people were willing to try it
so bad its good the game is barely functioning though like i can mess around for a couple of minutes and get right to the edge of the map and climb up walls i wish i could add a screenshot as for the actual game its a a mediocre money grab
if you want to download this have in mind one game loads like five minutes two connecting to server takes five minutes three after you join someone kills you and you have to redo joining do not install this piece of crap game is just trash
early access review this is actually on of if not the best collectible card game i have ever played lots of neat mechanics deck archetypes and a good pay model i can beat players who pay to win with a deck of cards i got for free haven spent a penny and had fun plus there are multiple ways to get whatever you need for new players a would recommend forge to get some easy rares and legends
product received for free early access review went from having lots of money to almost nothing after the last update about eight million to the equivalent of just over about a and that being generous it takes sometime to grind it out too there was no point in completely changing what was already good and taking away my hard earned in game money do not play this game
early access review not gonna write a long review although i have so much to talk about this game first live played adventure quest worlds for as long as i can remember from the beginning till the end of death and his thirteen chaos lord the thing that attracted me the most about adventure quest worlds is exploration butt its a two dimensional game how can there be any exploration well some zones maps shops pcs chain quests it center that can only be accessed by doing certain things whether it is typing command doing a quest solving puzzles it center these coupled with the main story quest line really make an otherwise two dimensional world really feel alive and i just done feel the same way about aqua three dimensional i really want to like this game live been waiting for years but i just cant recommend it not at this state at least
early access review completely unplayable everything is unbalanced poorly optimize everything is unbalanced ping after update everything is unbalanced will continue to play but i cant recommend for competitive players know its still in alpha
early access review might not get the timeline right haven played in a while i am also a pure free to play in rob craft this game used to be epitome of a well balanced free to play game to me i hope free am makes the game like that again live been on and off lately but live accumulated most of my hours before the disappointing updates the developers brought us this game used to be my favourite only because of the game mechanics of creating robots and fighting with them i had many hours of fun playing well balanced battles with a great community i want particularly good at the game but i still loved it then i left the game for almost a year and when i came back i was confused about the new system of weapons tier flattening but i was fine with it as long as the game is still fun and not pay to win i was around lvi out of one hundred at that time and i was saving up for a megabit the bad ass giant that gets all the medics then they removed it wow deus great now i grinder with my trusty little sub machine gun tank to go to it used to be around tier eighty nine soon they started rapidly adding new weapons and systems which i didst enjoy mostly because of balancing once i reached lvi they added the loot crate system which was really the final nail in the coffin rosewall he was the most subscribed youtube who makes kids for this game and has left the game because of these updates moment of silence ply i decided to stick with the game because i saved up quite a bit of role play one thing i did enjoy at that time was that normal bots can have technology experimental one parts and having them doesn't bind you to only mega parts soon i built a very powerful sub machine gun tank with mega plates and tier ten plates having a hefty amount of role play was the only reason i stayed in the game i played many battles and to be honest i was quite happy about the game play because i had a good bot after achieving lvi one hundred and twenty i decided that was enough a lot of rob craft players like to edit their bots when they get something new and i did that for every level that i achieved you gain ten cup every level before one hundred and five cup for every level after one hundred soon i reached some very high tiered battles and that when i realized the balancing with normal bots with special shotgun teleport and mega weapons mega plasmas mega sub machine gun since these equipments costs an absurd amount of role play and have somewhere around a thirteen chance of dropping in the most expensive crates few people have it that where the developers got money hungry people who would buy premium accounts and all that will have better equipment and those special equipment they get really unbalance the game i was constantly in games with enemies using mega sags and mega plasmas that can take down my tier ten shield in one hit one hit whf i was piss off but i kept playing because i felt the game was still solid but after weeks of grinding without success for anything good i said that it and i left the game i still loved the basic concept of the game but the money hungry developers ruined the game a few days ago i downloaded the game again because i wanted to see how the game is going and if there are improvements and i felt betrayed by the fact that the best robot live ever built that live used for hours cannot be used in battle because of cup restrictions a of it fit the restrictions perfectly before i done know what update they made and i didst want to know and i uninstalled overall i feel like this game had great potential but making a great game apparently want the developers goal this game is definitely still worth a try if you didst know how much better the game was before the updates but i just cant stand the nonsense the deus put into this game i hope the deus realize what they have done to such a great free to play game and and do something about it this was my opinions on the game its free to play so you wont be losing much if you try it
most realistic flight simulator ever you will get confused about what does what in this game at first but you will learn what know and buttons to push after awhile you can even set the game to not worry about most of those knobs and buttons it center quick campaign is fun especially when you are playing in a tank it center i just wish the games ground units played a hell of a lot better though update this games rocks in virtual reality
finally gotten to review this game almost four thousand hours of this game holy crap but emma drop the bomb here i gave this a thumbs down for a reason its current stagnation what i mean is valve has lost a bit of care with this game its a very strange game when it comes to the design over the years it is a completely different thing than what it was ten years ago originally that was awesome it was very unique and loaded with personality but now its a lost child abandoned in need of love and attention it int as bankable as counter strike global offensive or data anymore the updates have been awful radio silence from the deus it needs third party help and support badly in order to keep it alive valve must give development to the community or another company miss ass twenty eighteen was a horrible disappointment of an update adding terrible hats and doing nothing else i love this game still do but as of now the negative experiences in my near four thousand hours playing has outweighed my positive ones
before playing this game take a look at all recent reviews and you will see they are more or less all negative and the only reason this game is on mixed is because this game used to be good this game has been in development for over five years and there is still huge amount of problems i will list just a few of them down below bad net coding huge amount of bug glitches that takes years to fix terrible optimized game end game pcs will have two hundred thousand three hundred first person shooter in the being of a match and once all the players spawn and get close to one another the end game pcs will drop down to six thousand and eighty first person shooter on low graphics and medicare pcs will have one thousand five hundred and forty first person shooter insanely slow with the updates and when they finally do have an update it is just minor things like a new camouflage and a bunch of stupid balance changes that was unnecessary that nobody asked for unbalanced weapons planes and credit old prices between the three factions insane grind even if you pay money unplayable for new players once they get out of the starting stage of the game because of the huge grind and veteran players will just instant kill them because of better badges weapons takes ages to find battles during the morning night you will have to wait twenty minutes to find a battle people abuse game mechanics and reno done care as long as the players abusing bring in the developers make the game worse by each update and all they think about is the if you done have friends that already play this game you should not waste your time on this still in beta staged game the only reason this game is still not in beta is because the terms of service of steam prevented them you are only allowed to have a game that is under beta on steam for a amount of years or your game will get kicked out of the platform
done like the micromanagement it requires as its a originally for mobile if a few tweaks were to be made to timers and such for players on personal computer it would be a great time passer wont recommend it at this point but hopeful future updates will change my mind
great mob pro easy shop to learn overall fun for new players and experienced one gods are families and look nice auto build mechanic that allows you to make the game do your builds so you done have to touch the shop at all in game lots of fun mode the micro transactions done affect your characters re person so you can get closer to the action micro transactions the game modes can be boring at time playing one god for a very long time can be boring at times so buys the pack that gives you all the gods for free is a must side note although i done have many hours on steam i have one hundred hours on console so my point is relatively valid
a very fun game but the grind is ridiculous live been playing since the first day of ground forces and quite frankly have given up ever getting to modern vehicles which is the only thing that tempts me to play the game the modern tanks are all over the trailers but done kid your self unless you are prepared to spend hundreds of pounds you will never reach them so no i cant recommend this game not until a massive reduction in grind time its a came tho because the game is sound and fun and all the developers would have to do is too make an effort to reduce the grind in a big way which could be as simple as the removal of silver lions or a massive and i mean massive reduction in research and lions costs i know the entire community agrees with me on this so i done see why the deus a rent smart enough too see that their game will die without it i mean just reed the recent reviews offs all that needs to happen is some major changes to the grind and it they will gain the loyalty of the player base back and start getting the great reviews they got a few years ago again until then tho its a game not worth anyone time
early access reviewing only got two hundred and fourteen hours as i post this let me just say i done play battle royal games very often i jumped on the pub train for a minute but that was long ago this game is done right twenty one hours in three days this game is very fun for you and your friends the zip line is by far my most appreciated class that cap and the zip line distance is pretty insane combo anyways its free try it
in pretty new to the game but i just had to make a review thing that i rarely do first i want to talk about the community in my many years of playing video games i had rarely encountered such a friendly and welcoming community they embraced me from the beginning and they were really cool when we lost games because of my goodness which was quite often the deus work pretty close to the community most of them are big fans of their own game you will play with them quite often if you wanna team up or you have any questions just join the official discord the game is pretty cool too beautiful ships beautiful environment and plenty of pew pew and explosions you can get all the ships in the game quite fast just by playing the game no hidden stops or sneaky micro transactions you can get anything in the game with credits except the skins which still have a chance to drop from cargo boxes i got two this is the purest form of free to play that i have ever seen in a game especially in a mob this game is awesome not perfect done get me wrong it still has some issues and it can be rough around the edges sometimes but you wont even notice it the community is awesome like i said but i still had one or two bad encounters morons are everywhere and you cant really avoid it but i used that lovely red report button its a game you should really try nothing to lose only to gain sorry for the horrible formatting and the huge block of text a
this game is great if you re nostalgic for yugo and think you might want to try and play again but done want to learn all of the modern meta and rules the game uses the speed duel format which makes it so the games only last about five minutes each despite having micro transactions the game doesn't really feel pay to win to me because it absolutely showers you in gems sure you can buy a bunch of booster packs in order to farm particular cards though considering the usual price is one for a pack containing three cards it int really worth it constant events keep things interesting and i actually enjoy the player versus player though keep in mind you re going to see a lot of caber angel and ancient gear decks since that just the current meta id say give this a try and see what you think
early access review permanently banned for having a civil discussion about politics in the chat not even a warning or temporary ban apparently re tomato feels they are moral and political crusaders
live been playing this games couple months maybe a year ago it was very fun yesterday i started it up again and could not believe myself how awful it go did not even spend more than an hour playing it will never play it again ever try it and you'll know
fun game and unlike a lot of free to play games can be fully enjoyed without spending anything edit looking at this game some months later and i still think the real money aspect is completely optional not spending money does not this game any less fun sure you can spend some money but i feel i did that more to reward the devourer than to become overpowered
early access review can no longer say i enjoy this game the developers update it much too fast and take too many of the features we liked from the game adding new ones that made it enjoyable unless they decide to revert it back to an earlier version or at least remove some of these godawful new features i can not recommend this game
early access review am going to ignore all the technical issues with the game for this review for those things could be fixed the combat in bless is garbage for lack of a better term it was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is there are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion yet there is no such fun mobile movement in bless there no dodge there no blocking no teleworking nothing you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion the ranger class can dodge with a cool down of thirty five seconds beyond the combat bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes you mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours you kill things you collect things then you auto walk them back to turn them in rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring linear dungeon also all the story quests are instanced and there no way to do them with friends similarly the first two dungeons are solvable so bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game also as in sure you've heard the translations are quite confusing on the skill too tips for this creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you re not really sure what the rebuffs are or even what your skills are doing eventually you figure them out by trial and error people in the game are saying that part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works but that not what is happening here this challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english if this is your type of challenge play a different massively multiplayer online in a language you done understand gear initially for the first thirty levels as far as i was willing to play you do not find arm or save for in dungeons and even then you rarely get drops that are for your class basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that a rent for you and if you happen to be questing with your friends and they a rent close enough to bid on the item there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading maybe they will add trading later but this is just a minor annoyance anyway easily the worst massively multiplayer online live ever played most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues but there are core game mechanics that are just fixable without a complete redesign these listed above suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found without having to spend forty dollars by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left
nothing like do in game play graphics are sort of of but only because everything stays so zoomed out you cant see the lack of detail game play is a boring grind est just like every other pay town free korean massively multiplayer online if you want something that plays like do do turbines do the graphics are a bit dated but game play is truer to do
early access reviewed game is missing servers are saggy you have to edit the game to get first person shooter we were lied to you have to pay to revive at the same spot immediately you have to pay to teleport to dungeons you queued for did i say the entire end game is missing on existent
early access review the game is great in single player great vehicles good for creativity however the matchmaking queue sucks me my friends waited for an hour and we haven even been able to play the queue numbers kept going up and down
you just can not trust random people if you consider this to become your hobby know that you you willingly want to deal with stealing you thirty to sixty minutes compared to fps oder single games you suck for your own and can improve however even if you you improve in data you still will hardly notice that in every game since you get screwed once matched with unfriendly egomaniac hat filled people only play this with friends make a turn around data if you are a casual gamer as well
not very beginner friendly live spent two hundred and seventy dollars on this free to play game half of the money was spent on chests and most of the things i got from chests were avatars and voice packs extremely fun to play with friends great free game live enjoyed almost every second of it parts i do not like about the game queue time is sometimes pretty crazy for some game modes loki is a fair and balanced piece of fairness that should go and stomp on legs and i cannot wait till baron same i gets nerved perfect free third person mob game nine thousand nine hundred and ten fix loki or i will main him
was a great game but then developers smoked some bad stuff i guess and so they started to release more and more updates which destroyed the whole game doesn't make fun anymore in my opinion but i still hope for updates which will make the game good again
after having spent enough time on it one thousand hours i can say i have mixed feeling with this game on the plus the idea of mixing real time strategy map and your own units with a battle in the first person shooter its great nothing i have seen before and the main strength of the game the weapon system and its improvements its addictive so you keep playing to unlock and improve some weapons vehicles did i say how great is mixing a real time strategy with first person shooter on the minus the main problem id say is execution things in this game done work as they should i will explain this the real time strategy game is terrible the interface the performance the graphics everything is awful and slow you cannot group your units you cannot sort or search them the only way is micromanaging it doesn't matter what computer you have this will be saggy and slow it looks like it was designed by students ten years ago the game balance makes no sense at all the game is not realistic at all neither properly balanced so you find germans have the best weapons and then reno suddenly decides to improve their weapons with no explanation at all there are many examples regarding to this the lack of maps although there are several big maps after some days you will notice you are all the time playing the very same maps trough different lines but eighty of war game will be in town or mountain town two maps the engine performance the graphics look old they cannot afford any comparison with any five years old game but even though the performance is saggy and bad i play it with gtd ten seventy and even sometimes the game is not smooth id say that developing your own engine with small resources is a huge mistake the stability is terrible i have never seen a game that needs to be restarted so many times every couple of hours you will have cd no matter what the development policy is also total madness a perfect example there are four big maps although eighty of battles are played in only two you would think the first priority is creating new maps right no way reno will release new sounds new planes nonsense weapons modifications most of the time with no notice aka ninja update and many other useless things instead of maps tanks are a joke in this game i really done know how to fix it but a tiger ii shouldn't be scared of every infantry soldier they see on a motorbike overall impression with all these defects issues and mismanagement heroes and generals its an exceptional game done get me wrong the idea the core idea of playing an first person shooter with your own troops and follow the progress in the real time strategy is outstanding the problem is that is the only strong point of the game the implementation of it its really poor i would love to see this game managed by a more professional bigger company i done want to say reno is not professional but they are clearly short on resources so the game gets old unstable poor on performance unbalanced and their priorities makes no sense from my point of view i have to add that late changes done by reno are following a better direction and they finally implemented some really needed features like giving orders to several ats at the same time future this game will die soon i done want it but i think it will happen i still have one year veteran people have a limited amount of patience and while reno mostly provide players with promises and poor results other games appear and they done do the same mistakes i really hope this idea of sports will be properly implemented by a big company they will make tons of money
early access review it has a pop up game launcher that always starts up whenever you turn on your computer in annoying have to disable in startup apps why scumbag developers
i played both the original rob craft and the one currently available on steam the original one had and experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and blocks with experience you earn after which you could buy these blocks with credits you would earn or with money during the building of your bot your tier level would increase which would influence which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against battle were fought somewhere between ten a ten or twelve is twelve but could be randomized like six is nine depending on how strong the bots were battle was fought world of tanks style one life one enemy base one friendly base and go new version has different battle modes of which the main mode is a conquest based map with three different points to capture and re spawn enabled there is no experience system and no tier system you have a maximum of two thousands points to use that it blocks can be bought with points slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own done know the numbers but seems like twenty or so of its original worth or with money they can also be earned with our all time favourite loot boxes now the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember really enjoying the old version and to be fair although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round the new battle mode is still fun going around with bots building is still the same a part from the tiring stuff and its fun to build however what put me off was the ridiculous amount off i would describe it as rubbing it in that you are not currently a paying customer some examples when recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get four times as much dust if you were premium when opening loot boxes which you do get at a fair rate one hundred and twenty three a match you open eight blocks weapons it center off those you receive the bottom four the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying unlock with premium i would say i am resistant in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented but this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every ten minutes in short fun game went in the wrong direction still fun but not worth the trouble if you done intend to get premium
product received for free looking for a game to complete waste your life on well you found your maker blooms to battles is the absolute best way to do so considering the rounds can range from a couple minutes to hmm i done know days this game is actually pretty fun and its free soon heck yeah give it a shot

early access review combat doesn't make sense too linear some of the pcs does are hidden behind basic attacks makes it really hard for situational moves i like the idea but the way the skills have been set out just doesn't make sense to me the animations lock you in place for too long on almost every character in used to that on say a mage but ranger and warrior they should be mobile with at least dodge capabilities that will cancel an attack and get out of the way i wont mention the lag and optimisation as i would expect that to be fixed in the coming weeks as an early start to an early start fail such a shame its fixable though
early access review cant play the game servers are down please try again later neither the antivirus nor firewall is blocking the game if it works for me in the future i will edit this review edit turned off my firewall to play this game now in loving it tips wow youtube co watch keyword my
early access review easily one of the best card games i have ever played i done review any games but i can tell you this it is a great game i gave up hearthstone for this and have not looked back this is more of magic style game without being magic highly highly recommend
planet side two is one of the most impressive games i have played in terms of scale the maps or continents that you fight on are enormous and simulates a real war requiring both skill and strategy in order to be successful for a free to play game it is definitely worth a try saying this however planet side two has some frustrating flaws in to presentation pros the game is huge in scale and beautiful in look large fights with platoons can be very fast paced and exciting free to play cons planet side two requires a decently strong computer to play and its scale can lead to a lot of travelling on foot just to get into a gunfight newcomers have very little room to improve and the game is easily dominated by those who have more experience certs the points with which you use to purchase upgrades take a long time to get and in order to unlock a gun you must play for a great deal of time lastly the any vehicle can quickly kill you which leads to many frustrating moments while playing
complete cash grab once there were four classes that you could play for free with others available to pay for with recent changes you have one class you can choose from and any past classes you might have levelled up were completely deleted and nothing returned a complete to game that is on the edge of being as as digital homicide games only difference is this actually works
this game took up so much of my life running the vault doing quests fighting off mole rats arranging love triangles fighting off more mole rats building weapons and fighting off rad scorpions avoid the in game purchases and its well worth it
the new deus have done lots of good things for this game much better than when hammer point had control however still not everyone cup of tea but i find it quite addicting though it can be very frustrating at times dying from glitches
at first this game seems rather good i built a large vault and had many people in it however after i had sunk many hours into this game i came a cross one flaw that ruins the game the fact that i cant go five minutes without rads options raiders death claws mole rats and rad roaches attacking my base and harming my dwellers not only that but fires will randomly break out in completely empty rooms and these will usually spread to the rest of the vault where most of my dwellers will die
what could i say about team fortress that hast been said before its simply a great game not only is it free to play but it offers unique and fun game play characters and innovations that many games today lack
early access review despite the long queues to get in and bad optimization the class i was playing berserker is really satisfying and the game so far is a lot of fun as long as you done mind the roughness of beta id recommend to try the game
of boy its that time again lets all say it in unison its a downloadable content plagued clone of min craft i honestly would rather pay full price for a completed game or at least one that doesn't shove its own ads down your throat every ten seconds claiming to shave one seconds off of scratching your balls
this game plain and simple betrayed my trust what do i mean by that i picked up rob craft a while ago back in the days before there were walking techs when there was a tech tree and i could feel myself progressing in the game i spent real money to gain access to a part i wanted to use and gain access to one of the premium robot that came with that purchase again this was way back in the day when it was all about building and protecting your captains chair making something unique that worked i had made myself a hovering ship in the same style as the floating ships in a mario game then the deus had an update not only did the update remove all of my progress thus far it removed my robot and my premium ship that i paid real money to have and have access to i lost everything when it updated but i decided to give it another chance and rebuild from the ground up this was the beginning of a slippery slope of removal of progress updates that drastically altered the game and finally the death of what i thought was a unique and wonderful experience i played world of tanks for a long time about two years total before i picked up rob craft and the game felt more rewarding and interesting than both world of tanks and war thunder despite being in the same genre of game now the game is a husk of the creativity and interesting game play if you wanted to pick up rob craft now i couldn't recommend it if you payed me it doesn't feel like you are making progress it doesn't feel like you can be successful with your own creation and worst of all it doesn't feel fun if the deus ever decide to make a separate game that is more of the classic rob craft i would love to play it even pay for the experience of that again this game int gonna go out with a bang or with a graceful defeat in the likes of paragon the game will wither and that is a crime
early access review this game is in alpha give it time and it might be the next big thing i played the game for a bit and i actually enjoyed it the gunplay is better than footnote like seriously its less ring people being people they would assume this is just a footnote clone but me playing footnote for a couple hours and experiencing how horrible the gunplay of that game has done tell me to get good at that ring bullshit this game is actually pretty well made i hope in the future you add season events to make this game more interesting the graphics are nice and well optimized in my experience and while people are arguing about how their ping is horrible well this game just released this week and doesn't have most regions added but will be added in the future i hope i live in asia and i connect to eur and barely sense any lag tbs and its brilliant mag for the developers hire this is a new game and it being a free to play game i hope you done push the micro transactions like most free to play games do as what footnote did they just made skins and didst add pay to win items to give the players that bought it an advantage over the free to plays i enjoyed the game even if i lose the match because of the teamwork involved with it so done take it away with overpowered bullshit that would destroy the flow of the game thanks for creating a battle royal game that i can run in five thousand and sixty first person shooter and keep improving this game forgive any grammar errors due to english not being my first language
early access review in in a middle of a competitive game and all of a sudden out of nowhere this games launcher opens up right in the middle of a game like why its a stupid game anyway just take it off of the store
early access review they up this game this was better when they started it it just keeps getting worse i just went back to look at the game after a few months and it is still bad the game is even worse then before they shouldn't of changed it i done recommend this game to anyone
this and euro truck sim are my two favourite zen games its great to just sit back and learn to take apart and put back together all these different guns and vehicles and skeletons live actually learned a little bit about the basic internal mechanisms of guns just from playing this to improve your world of guns experience get baked one thousand and ten chill
why this game better than personal computer version one good matchmaking tier one not facing tier four max tier twenty two no arty many tank have a same stat normal stat before they get nerf in personal computer over you easy get premium tank in this game just when you lucky get it arm or inspector
early access review this really good just for begin games i really enjoyed it and hopefully its get better and better like movement its something weird and other stuff but i really recommend this game
early access review this game is amazing at first i did not know if i would like it because i am used to playing footnote but after giving this game a chance i find myself playing this more
let me start off by saying this game is extremely unique and as such i cant find anything to compare it to as far as game play its simple at surface level jump in find a fight and take a point once you get into the technical parts of the game it becomes very complex very fast with team work at the center of it all be ready to die all the games tutorial doesn't do the game justice as its long and uninformative so youtube is your best friend progression can be grind for new players as theirs no clear path to getting certs the games form of currency but once a player gets past this hurtle is loads of fun
this is the best card game live played and my new favourite unless the cyanide and happiness card game comes to personal computer somehow its got an incredible amount of tactical depth from being able to select an avatar from one of the elder scrolls races to affect how you collect cards as you process through the game to being able to level up certain cards when you your avatar levels up in eighteen battles into the story campaign and live been presented with many story related options that gave me different cards based on the choices i made there are also many different types to the cards that are attributed to different stats as you play through the story or level up you unlock new decks that augment different play strategies based on the two main attributes that make up the deck in the deck editor you can pick up to two main attributes for your different decks what attributes you choose affect the types of cards you can put in those decks there are some duel class cards and a fair amount of neutral cards that done belong to any attribute mostly monsters and deemed constructs from what live seen thus far but most cards belong to one attribute strength intelligence agility endurance and willpower each one provides more cards of that type that helps its play styles as you level up for example a deck of strength and intelligence would likely have a lot of magic spells and creatures for intelligence and many that are focused on an aggressive play style in contrast a willpower and endurance deck would have a lot of smaller creatures and ways to augment them to be large tougher from the willpower and a lot of cards help you out more and more the longer the match goes on from the endurance there also the fact that there are usually two lanes to the combat sometimes the lanes have special effects that change what happens to creatures in that lane for example there a shadow lane that provides cover to creatures the first turn they re placed so they cant be attacked by other creatures during that turn there windy lanes that move a random creature from one lane to another and even an arena lane that gives a random item to any creature summoned to that lane with so many different variables and more being discovered every few matches this game is rapidly becoming one of my favourites edit you can only have up to seventy cards in your deck and a minimum of fifty cards a maximum of three copies of a card can be in your deck and some cards are legends ultra rare and you can only have one of those per deck excess cards can be trapped in soul gems and will give you a number of soul gems based on its rarity and how many there are of it you can then use those soul gems to soul summon cards you done already have of course better cards have higher soul summon costs you can also collect gold from battles and use that gold to buy card packs or entry tickets to the arena battle up to ten opponents with a randomly drawn deck until you beat all ten or lose three time chances for better than normal and more than normal prizes or you can save them up to purchase in game do the dark brotherhood downloadable content appears to be able to be purchased a la carte using in game currency yet another plus for the game in my opinion you can also earn more card packs in game through play and some of your cards have different paths they can be upgraded along

i found it very good but it has no button to close it so i tried to get up but i was taped to my chair which i wondered how did that happen but when i tried to move my chair it was bolted to the ground and after that i looked out my window and i found out my house was in space so please do send help i have no idea where i am and i think in running out of oxygen i just hope my family finds this so they know what happen to me if you see this i love you all guys and i will miss you love thomas
very well made game the club system is completely broken though there needs to be a way to have people have the same level of power as the owner but not be able to kick the owner please fix this although they are a person who i can easily contact it still makes me very upset that this can still happen
i expected more form this game based on my experience playing wot personal computer battles are very very short no artillery limited options for game play it center all in all download wot personal computer if you can and you'll be much happier
product received for free early access review after coming back to the game after a few months it has changed very much from what i and what seems everyone else who first played it when it was released into early access remember the progression system was removed and replaced with a free chest system to unlock pieces but if you a rent one for waiting you can purchase them and unlock even better things higher chance for things that are actually good i cant recommend this to anyone since the game int what i remember it to be that kept me playing it
early access review this free to play battle royal has won me over it has snowboarding hand gliding mountain climbing and zip lining you can join a squad of up to four players play duo or solo pick your spawning point on the grid based map and your package of choice your objective is to survive the harsh cold you will be pushed around the map by a blizzard which will black out certain regions of the map which are randomly chosen so that no match can be predicted beforehand eventually there will be but one small space remaining and the numbers of players will have dwindled thin to all but the strongest and most evasive survivalists in these last moments before the blizzard completely engulfs the map the players have to fight for their seats aboard the escape helicopter teams will be at each others throats at this point as they all struggle to climb the ladder praying that they a rent killed before comfortably claiming their seat one time i had almost claimed my seat and about one second before sitting down i was sniped it was agonizing yet the thrill this game delivers me in moments like that are just plain addictive when you do finally escape the blizzard that feeling of accomplishment is definitely there my fondest moment thus far was when my friend and i had both taken down two people each who had us cornered down in a three floor building the entire building was up in smoke and it was like a call of duty modern warfare campaign it was intense and as soon as i saw the silhouette of a person i unloaded with my origin twelve shotgun their buddy made the mistake of rushing to their aid and i downed him too we both were the last two players standing in the game and we claimed our seats and triumphantly escaped live had many more satisfying experiences like this one and i could sit and name more but then this review would be absurdly long so let me just conclude by saying that the early access title ring of elysium is a game you will have a blast in and to me it feels like multiple games in one if you have friends play with them it will only enhance the experience tenfold i highly recommend ring of elysium with a nine hundred and ten and it is one of the few free to play games worth playing
its a very addictive and immersive game it requires strategic thinking and are planning game play is relatively well balanced it would be better if you could enable better graphics on win versions similar to the personal computer version
every game have problems and new a clearly have a lot of them load screen bugs rendering delay first person shooter drops bad optimization and sadly pay to win but int for those reasons that i have to hate it like its hated i played war a infestation survivor stories a long time ago and one thing i know for sure new a doesn't deserve so much negative reviews like it is receiving of course my review it is based on my game play experience with the game its a funny game to play with friends or even solo some times doesn't exist one in game in the world that you probably wouldn't pass through some bad times new a its a good game int perfect not even close but its a nice game done deserve this whole hate
early access review played about a year ago and it was fun and simple but now with all this fancy stuff the game just is not fun anymore i do not recommend this game sheepdog
early access review game is in early access for a reason all these negative reviews are from people who were expecting a full game on day a lot of people are complaining about the tutorial where they get stuck equipping a skill mon guys not that hard to figure it out i am enjoying the game has a lot of content even at max level it wont take you one day to max out all your stats your gear your pets stats and your mount stats so al these people complaining about their be in no content probably came from a first person shooter game that you done even need to level up try the game out up to you to really decide if you like it
you done even have to play on survival mode for this godforsaken crap to undo everything you've built up i started a second game after getting a better understanding of the mechanics got an absurdly powerful plasma rifle as my first reward used training rooms to amp up the stats of my residents and how was i done in a single random group of burrowing mole rats made me burn through all of my st impacts and killed over half of all my characters levels ranged from about five to twenty for an average of fifteen or so were talking about the second weakest enemies in the series besides rad roaches here i swear on my honor and sanity during that same sequence that made me rage quit i had one vault dweller armed with an enhanced sniper rifle that i believe had army piercing capabilities i uninstalled the game the second i quit so i cant confirm is the last mole rat in the vault fired about three to four volleys of shots and the the rat still killed him this would seem to suggest that standard enemies can get stronger if you done meet some arbitrary game play milestones not that you know given that the help section says nothing to that effect there no level indicator for enemies and you also cant get a numerical value for their health or depending on the circumstances even a health bar i assume this because to get feral goal attacks in my previous run but i decided to wait on making babies to power level stats this time the final record for how long i lasted in the game before getting royally screwed was three goddamn days to clarify after the basics have been introduced and your vault population expands new training rooms that increase stats are unlocked this is because the only thing that levelling does is increase your characters health but said health increase is supposedly greater if the endurance stat is increased but just like everything else in this damn game there absolutely no way to know what the hell impact its having let me just go over the things the game will never let you know the aforementioned extent to which endurance impacts health increase the numerical value of the characters health the default likelihood of anything happening when using the radio to broadcast in the wasteland or having a death law randomly show up at your vault door what stat if any governs melee weapons effectiveness how close far a character is from building up to a critical attack and with regards to rooms almost everything want to know to what extent merging rooms helps before spending money too bad want to know precisely to what extent increasing training room speed helps before spending thousands of caps to upgrade it too bad want to know if the help section aka bethesda is using you regarding training speed going faster with more people in the room well i sure as hell didst notice any difference want to know whether you have the crafting resources recipes necessary to make something in the later crafting menus before spending thousands of caps upgrading a weapon crafting room too bad even the rad roaches can be completely absurd get like one stuck in an individual room with the aforementioned plasma rifle and it will be dead before the animation or sound of an attack can be heard but have them spawn in a large room far from anyone and five to six can turn into ten to twenty for no reason and one of the rooms is literally incapable of housing residents despite being a location enemies can spawn in and just to put the cherry on the garbage game play sundae your little vault minions could only be more incompetent if they shot themselves if an enemy walks into another room your poor helpless be guard suffers from crippling depression that prevents him her from pursuing due to their profound sense of failure to stop them earlier and must be dragged by you every single damn time but done think that it ends there melee enemies on the other end of the room can still hit your sniper rifle welding vault weller on the opposite side and they most certainly will be on the opposite side because bethesda naturally understands that if there one thing that a time sensitive resource draining cluster fucking of a combat sequence needs its for every single goddamn character to waltz over to completely arbitrary locations within a room before actually opening fire or putting out a literal fire and on top of that human combatants will often stumble and stagger for what feels like an on after loosing all their health dragging out the time that resources cant be produced for even longer thus putting you in the position of sitting there unable to do anything but wait as a bunch of drama queen raiders drunkenly stumble about harmlessly with your vault dwellers being equally passive even as the sirens blare and the resource bar flashes like its actively being depleted i knew bethesda were hopelessly inept in most respects but i didst think they find a way to screw up were giving you this for free think that the end of the bullshit nope if you look through the help section it turns out that the radio that can be used to attract people to your vault as well as pretty much any instance in which the vault door opens has the capacity to bring death laws charging into the vault death laws and if my experience with the mol rats and roaches is any indication i could only expect every character to drop dead the second they enter the room never take any damage and somehow fill my computer with malware take money out of my account for micro transactions and give me cancer its never happened to me but again i only ever got as far as feral goals so its probably a late game thing with the game play being a mindless grind est the only other possible asset is story which as one would naturally expect from a free game is nigh nonexistent in terms of being a source of sincere motivation you re a vault and there are people in it the end of there are quests that you can send vault dwellers out on assuming that you can spare any of them your valuable equipment and you build an overseer room even after all that you re rewarded with staring at a travel progress time for hours on end because it can take up to thirty hours likely more since the travel times seem to increase as the quests progress and i think i recall one having a thirty six hour time to start with to get to from a location for one mission so good luck trying to stay invested in quests that have you sitting around doing nothing for hours waiting for one or two lines of dialogue to give you any more story before making you do it all over again and on a personal note the game is an affront to biology and really in favor of the adam and eve story because there more incest than a southern probably should stop now before i violate steams guidelines regarding user posts before i finish that but the point is there no amount of in family screwing that cant occur in the game the weirdest thing is that the game actually kind of encourages it with the mechanics no in serious character names can repeat so its difficult to keep track of who related to who and it takes hours for radio calls to bring people to your vault if they bring people to your vault that was one of the reasons i had only like thirty to forty characters for so long i was trying not get parents and siblings to get down with one another but with the way this game presents them you think humans were mice or something anyway that was just a niggling aspect that bothered me the more substantive issue is the game play i you need a fallout fix then play new vegas again if you haven played new vegas before then my question is what in the hell are you doing looking at bethesda to make a good fallout game go play new vegas instead id recommend wasteland two but i haven played it yet though its in the same vein as fallout so i guess it be worth a look
negatives one too many sniper rifles two same horrifyingly awful textures i done even remember the old war having textures this bad what happened three the footstep audio bubble is extremely small you cant hear someone walking around until you re right on top of them either that or footstep audio is extremely lang bugged floodwater int a concern whatsoever in this game still the same instant heal with beds which can make combat extremely unfair and cheesy healing over time the way he implemented healing makes combat fair its pure cheese in infestation still tons of cheaters pros one loot is great but they need to tone down sniper rifles still the same old war combat which is good other than the instant heal from beds gear has stats now so we can actually see what damage damage resist gear has which is great its basically the same old war just loot is a lot better although i done know if that only on beginner servers or what but the loot is currently great
this is by far the best game i ever played whoever says that team fortress two is dying and is wrong because of one or two bad updates doesn't mean the game is and we as the community should know that and support valve for keeping alive this masterpiece but instead you just quoting the game because you are never happy with what you have
this game was my first massively multiplayer online that got me in to mos so i will say i was younger than now so i might have had a different option if i played it now so this game to me was god amongst all its player versus player is insane content nope but combat and skill system is some thing i would like to see in more mos is it worth your time yes
early access review ont get me wrong but i absolutely love this game but there are specific issues i have with it for example to snipe someone is damn near impossible even if the scope is dead on the from twenty feet away and can we please get rid of the one hit pan it is so over powered and it completely ignores arm or and they done even have to be next to you sometimes the melee works from several feet away
would love to play the game some more but game guard thinks everything on my computer is used to cheat somehow no amount of troubleshooting worked to get it running past the first time yet another victim of dry gone amok
the game is fun but you have to buy stuff and everything is astral related so wants the point with gold there is none really laugh out loud player versus player really fun classes are a joy to play id rather have an option for a subscription or work to get the gear
was a good game some people like it now i personally hate most of the changes for balancing reasons inhibiting styles of play and the reduction of creativity so all the robots are samey now wait and keep in mind i have a lot of nostalgia from when i played the game and may be biased but that whatever May
early access review really enjoying the game people need to understand that the servers were not going to be good at launch no massively multiplayer online ever is in glad not all content int in right now mean they can tweak it all and release it when they feel like its ready one hundred and thirty founders and i done regret it one bit
was not a fan the play is not as seamless as you would think and i never really felt like any of the battles had any effect on the big campaign i really tried to like this but was not a fan in the end the shooting and fighting part was sub par even compared to other ftp
its a min craft clone in not going to say anything more on that subject because i feel its unnecessary if you done like min craft or clones of it then you be able to tell by the screenshots that you wont like this game and there no point in complaining about something that was made so obvious yes that a backhand to all the not recommended reviews complaining about it now if you do like min craft and its clones or if you just like creative survival games like i do then i would definitely recommend the game its a pretty game and for how it looks it runs very well in not someone with an ultra overpowered personal computer but my crotchety old laptop can run it with decent frames its a little different from min craft in terms of game play and progression and i think that makes it unique enough so as not to be essentially a duplicate of my with different graphics it is something you'll have to get used to if you come from playing my though however despite being free to play you do have to pay to use a lot of features which i suppose is understandable but it does feel a bit deceiving consider this a free demo rather than a free game and you'll be a little less disappointed by the number of premium features you have to pay for as it is you still get full game play out of the free version old if you like min craft clones or survival games in general you'll like this game and its still unique enough to be a different game from but if you want the full list of features in the game be prepared to pay twenty for them and if you done like my clones why you even here brush
okay so some people hate this game some love it so here are my thoughts the unique game play and artsy character design is what truly holds this game together otherwise the advertising spamming insane micro transactions and standoff lag would ruin it all so as you've probably figured out this is a top down shooter which as far as i know is pretty unique for a fantasy massively multiplayer online this game is quite challenging it is a perm death type game so if you die you must pick a new character and start completely over on the other hand it int terribly challenging as long as you play it smart there is also a hotkey command to bring you back to the safe one the perm death can really turn you off especially if you have good items and was close to reaching level twenty reaching level twenty will unlock a new character class or two which is pretty much what keeps you playing this game also has a massive amount of enemies for you to fight many with different abilities which is also what makes this game unique id recommend everyone at least try this game you may hate it you may like it and let me just say i done play this excessively its just something fun to play here and there also its a very tiny download and takes a few seconds its worth a try May
if you play this game i hope your ready to die by more tanks than you can count and if your new you know whats great you cant kill the tanks so its endless amount of fun by dying to things you cant kill over and over and over
early access review this game is one of the best free to play shooters in steam as it is not pay to win but is easy to learn but hard to master like counter strike go i even bought the founders package that went on sale the only thing i want to complain about is ping as it is unstable especially in the sea server but overall its a great game and you should go and try it for yourself
this game is a joke right it in sucks the artificial intelligence is aggressive as hell they can slam into you even just slightly touch you and you spin outta control you can slam into them and they wont nudge half the vic hales pictures when choosing done even show up and the handling is disgusting just erase this game
want a game that is more diabolo than diabolo three is always thought hey wouldn't it be awesome if dark souls was a top down arg i know you do and i know you have so why haven you played path of exile yet a while back they got rid of the three difficulties i thought it would be a crappy change but they went from four acts to ten acts in one update i done miss the three difficulties at all this game gets new content and expansions faster than jimmy johns can deliver me a sandwich when i take a break from this game i always come back and go holy i was ninety done with this game now i am like ten done and that is awesome play this keep playing this and when you are done playing it they will shove a bazillion more maps into the game and add nine hundred and three thousand four hundred and fifty our more features and you have to go back you have no choice you have to that is how path of exile works it is the never ending game that is one hundred free why are you still reading this you should be downloading it thank you you re welcome
okay this is an edit to the original my opinion hast changed i still like the game the development seems to be making improvements to the game things can go quickly or you have this nice drawn out space battle and just blow each other up which is what i like graphics are nice i love the detail of the ships mostly it seems like they took there time in that aspect overall still and eight out of ten i hope to see more people join up for the battles of first i would like to say i have no idea how i got this game it just was in my library decided to install and go from there there is no tutorial but after a few matches you done need one everything is kind of easy to learn i honestly believe this game would be even more awesome if there was no pay wall you can however earn things but simply playing the game it may take you longer but guess what if you got money get what you want overall i give the game an eight out of ten its fun fast paced sort of and its in space may
early access review get game play as russian get into game do horribly get first promotion excitedly another game earn more money play for a few more hours to try and get better and richer get my sixth promotion excited to start in the target into my first war game play as a sniper get extremely lucky head shot from like get temporarily banned for no reason would get unfairly banned again
early access review started with this game before last patch it was good and funny as hell but after last patch its total gone everything that the game had different is gone hate it they total screw hole point of it never playing again see a
early access review this is an an amazing game and a different take on the genre sure there are still a lot of things that need working but the concept is so amazing the game will never get old
you wanna good wii combat simulator i am sure you do that why you are here int it you want that game to be well balanced too right yes i am sure you do you want a game with no nation bias of course then why the hell are you looking at war thunder seriously go play one of the red orchestra games they may not have planes and they may not be free but they are cheap and have really good tank game play that is both fun and balanced and still maintain historical accuracy in short basically everything war thunder is not the first thing you notice with war thunder is what i call the shell which is basically what you perceive the shell is probably the best part of war thunder the graphics are absolutely beautiful all the models for the tanks and planes are fully detailed down to every nook cranny and bolt but then you play the game the game is pretty fun at first but once you hit tier i iii that when the game starts to go down hill and that is when you really and i mean really start to notice something is incredibly wrong with the russian planes tanks just to put it into perspective this is a true story by the way my tiger tank was unable to penetrate the front of a russian tank model nineteen thirty four at less than forty meters and he was directly in front of me he ended up killing me because the tiger really didst have over one hundred my thick arm or and a ridiculous gun that just western propaganda according to foreigner i done think they actually said that but it wouldn't surprise me if they did because that is their reasoning behind anything that is not russian being under powered another example would be the time i went into a head on fight with a yak in my typhoon mail very historically accurate i know and naturally i killed him since four my machine guns hurt but while his plane was a flaming and wingless wreck he managed to get one last cannon round out which caused both my wings and my tail to fall off and my plane was a flaming wreck just like his now that that is out of the way remember how i mentioned the shell well the shell is not really there for most people and while this problem has been debt with in the past it still exists but what is it well all those lush trees bushes and grass can just disappear if you go into the options menu and turn down your graphics and while on your screen you are very well camouflaged in your stud iii some russian guy across the map sees you with your pants down looking like a drooling idiot so how is the game developing you might ask well the deus are just adding content and not really fixing anything and the drooling middle school age masses that is the war thunder community is okay with this speaking of the community lets talk about them basically the type of brain you'll be playing with are ones that are not developed enough to use logic and reason and if the match does not go in their way they will spam the chat all caps screaming at everyone who is still alive its to the point where reporting these people is unless since there is so many of them and foreigner doesn't do anything about them that why they are too afraid to fix the bushes and trees problem they are too afraid to loose a handful of players there are so many more things i could go over but there are other reviews out there that will explain those things i failed to mention in greater detail than me i will end on this note i do not recommend war thunder to anyone there are so many promises that are unfulfilled it makes day look like a finished product and the sad part is this used to be a pretty good game but it has been on a steady decline ever since before they added tanks a couple years ago well goodbye my friends thank you for reading this review and i hope it helped may
a good massively multiplayer online for manga anime fans a its fun and easy to play and has some good choices for classes it also has tons of items that can change how you look to others in the game from just the equipment to costume sets the skills you can learn for each class are also fun to use in combat
early access review done really like battle royal games but this one i find it fun you got some classes every one with their signature weapons and multiple skills you can craft some good items on the points of control all in all it makes for a great action packed experience and you done have to build dumb walls also for being early access its pretty good
i bought the original yeah the ripoff this is a copy of the same game with terrible micro transactions and horrid graphics done bother i wasted my life and money with this game done repeat my mistakes
one of the best games of its genre truly worthy game which awaken my past excitements from the old days of diabolo ii which i could replay infinitely graphics are a top notch game play is polished in game talent system unique gear custom table beyond belief very much recommended to all fans of dungeon crawling
i really love these types of games live played a lot and i feel i could easily sink a few hundred hours into this title pros great classes cool graphics easy to get into but with layers of complexity built in with formation strategies and placing tools in just the right spots and its great that it plays even if you log off so you re always making progress cons very very addictive really glad they added the game to steam because i think its great
do presentation in school topic is what inspires you most pick meme do a passionate speech about how memes inspire my data play my voice is shaking nobody says a word when i finish feel extremely awkward nobody really talks to me after class some girls giggle when i leave teacher holds me back and just quickly whispers i love memes too we just smile at each other for some seconds before i leave feel so alive right now
live played long enough to form an educated opinion on the game its not enjoyable addicting yeah maybe to the right person but its an awful game from the ground up the game doesn't focus on nickel and dining you it focuses on pulling double and triple digits from you this game was designed for those japanese people who spend thousands on phone games and this is a phone game you can spend hundreds on a meta capable deck and if you re lucky it will be playable for a few months but its a complete waste of your money when a new ban list comes out every two or three decades people will throw their hands to the sky and say this is the best the game has ever been finally there variety in decks do not listen to these people they are either ignorant or lying to you and themselves the game will very quickly tend towards a small handful of decks that beat everything else and that to be expected it makes sense that there will be a handful of better decks but the problem is that after a certain point only those decks are played the exact same twenty card deck copied off due links game a co and that means every game is decided by the coin flip kenai is either too greedy to adjust the ban list to widen the meta or too stupid to add cards that would create variety i could go on and on about the fundamental problems this game and kenai has done spend money on this game do not play this game buying physical yugo cards that you could win games and have fun with is much cheaper than buying digital loot boxes if you want to play yugo for free go play go pro percy or dublin book
early access review probably the best battle royal game out on the market better than pub cod wont mention that kids cartoon one thou game runs nice and smooth and i have experienced zero lag specs in tight gig am to shogun play feels really licensee freedom i mention its free
early access review let me clear something with all of you the game as it is right now for me is not even a beta version it is so ungodly unfinished i could consider it as an alpha version more than anything i played the original adventure quest of and adventure quest worlds when i was younger but i did not expect a three dimensional version but here we are adventure quest three dimensional i forgot how sometimes nostalgia does not guaranty a good game and do not get me wrong change or upgrading is good but if it is done correctly at first i was happy and strangely excited to play it until i actually started the game for me was like having a kick on the balls just to see how bad everything looks moves controls and acts so if you are looking for a new massively multiplayer online to try driven by nostalgia or even wanting to see what adventure quest was all about emma i suggest you to skip this not worth your time
early access review seems like nothing kills a good game faster than game developers who simply done care about the players who they re designing the game for man squads as if it want hard enough getting twelve dedicated friends for a game like this of and you cant group up to six people so its two randoms for your group who steal your loot at forge go rush six people with them and then lobby before you can even res them back from a unique class based battle royal to something a bit like footnote without the building with more ring including random teammates if you want a full team so exciting not knowing whether you re going to be playing with illiterate adults or actual children and no in game voice
the following review is from a is heavy assault main no other classes except max are used by me this was the very first game where i started to use mouse keyboard oddly being plonked right into amir bio labs no tutorial world for me a under new conglomerate assault this was where i realized three things a my aim sucked a i am not john rambo a what the fuck that unfair i shot him first after a quick revision of tactics a class change and using cover more often i gradually got a lot better sticking with my team and trying to be the main focus of enemy fire without dropping this was where i started to like the game a little more since i was so used to playing more laid back first person shooter not ninety eight fps graphics amazing lovely game visually when there a rent nineteen snipers trying to pick you off live not seen the graphics on any other setting other than its max but in sure it looks pretty on any but graphics int why i love the game game play the vehicles are designed extremely well each faction even has their own respective strengths and weaknesses that a player can use with their play style the weapons are different also for each faction with their respective strong points no bullet drop faster rate of fire it center with each weapon comes their modifications scopes silencers it center the game runs smooth when i shot an enemy it actually hits the enemy live had no reason period to complain over stupidly large hit boxes vehicles are balanced and unlike most other games they done suck bullshit when someone pulls out their lock on the war zone beautifully designed complex and various environments that have you changing your tactics or stalling your teams push for example a push toward the bio labs in vehicles can go stagnant with the actual assault on the bio lab due to maps being your only real support if you like being part of a huge assault force this game is for you i still suffer from photo shortlist syndrome and shoot all three targets to get no kill in getting better what i hate ill edit this out if i find a way to change it or get good but i hate how aircraft are piloted that about it old if you like big first person shooter fights where teamwork is key planet side two is the game of done think the medics are any brainier than battlefield medics when it comes to reviving you
early access review do not buy the excuse of it being early access is a lie this game has been out for years in other regions and they improve fixed none of the issues in fact they made it worse for starters i was so excited for bless online i really tried to enjoy it i really really tried in the end i ended up having to request a refund bless online is unplayable from the crashes to the first person shooter issues and constant stuttering it is infuriating trying to get out of the starting zone this is if you can make it past the login character select page without it freezing or having to close out multiple times and reopening the game despite all the technical and horrible translation issues the improved combat system is absolutely the worst there is such a huge delay on the combo abilities that the combat seems slow boring and more of a chore than anything i really do hope the developers actually buckle down and try again bless online has so much potential to be something amazing but until then ill find something else to pass the time
the hunter let me start by saying that the amount of hours live accumulated on steam does not resemble my time in game for i started playing before this game was on steam now to my opinion of the hunter its a free game in the sense that this free game lets you have a peak at the game before investing anything into it people these days expect everything for nothing this is not how it is sadly for those the hunter is an absolutely gorgeous game so far the best in simulating a real hunting environment you need patience skill and a good eye now to the of so hated high price of the game if you re interested in the hunting part and not so much which weapon you re hunting with you can lay down as little as one thousand four hundred and ninety nine us for three months of membership which allows you to do everything in the game and receive the following guns twelve gauge single shot shotgun gauge pump action shotgun revolver and an assortment of clothing callers and scopes for your weapons the shotgun alone allows you to hunt every single animal in this game so summary of the price one thousand four hundred and ninety nine gets you to the full game for three months
early access review first of all i just want to say that everyone you see below me is right and totally and absolutely correct this game has gone so far south that it has managed to encompasses the globe enough times to reverse the earth rotation from its normal gravitational orbit of east to west and changed the course to north and south thereby effectively causing global warming okay but seriously though this game is so terrible that i cannot literally even begin to describe how bad this game has turned out to be without literally repeating what has already been said if you have not yet taken everyone else sword for it then please at least take mine i started playing this game last year and to be honest it was a heck of a lot of fun and all the things that people are talking about with play to win was well frankly not there and it was great skins for your soldiers and extra gun slots or commander perks all that was just as micro transactions were meant to be well simple pay if you wanted because you had the cash and as far as levelling up went it was just like any other regular first person shooter such as call of duty or battlefield online easy simple and yes there was some grinding involved but it was never too far out of reach and unobtainable to the point that it was game breaking it was just play for fun levelling up but now of yes all the rumours are true they totally and completely and absolutely botched the system where now one hundred points per kill is definitely not going to cut it anymore to where just like in the old days you were levelling up at one hundred experience points per kill and slashing though ranks like a boss you would watch your character go from private to major within a matter of no time and best part about it was it did to feel like a chore there was no major grinding that was needed all you had to do was play a few casual games and boom there a go wham am thank you a am and your ribbons were all caught up your guys was as previously stated a major just within a few hours or so of game play and it was santa mastic now its more like you have to put in one hundred hours not experience points per week just to be able to level up and i get it game developers i totally get and understand that you don to want your game to be so super easy that everyone gets all the ribbons and rewards and achievements within a matter of days because if your game was that easy it would be where people could finish in a matter of weeks and leave your game then nobody would play anymore so i totally get and understand where you are coming from on that but to make the game so mind numbingly hard and grinding that just for me to even get to the next rank i would either have to shell out my soul for the cost of a premium account and again i get it you are a small developer so you need money or have to put in so many hours of work that i would never have to see the light of day again is pretty ridiculous so hopefully if the game developers read this then please please please i am begging you as well as many of us others just go back to the way it was there is nothing wrong with changing little things about a game like maybe adding extra guns or doing the paid subscription old to make money but it should never have come to this so hopefully you guys will listen to us and actually hear us out on what we have to say as players thank you for your time of reading and sorry that it was so long if you felt like i wasted your time laugh out loud
i have only a few hours on this game and while i went with an open mind my first impression are pretty bad the user interface is award and counterintuitive and the game doesn't bother to explain to much about its mechanics you could argue that you learn them over time but its hello frustrating doing even that however in spite of the crap user interface the first few matches were okay everyone seemed to have the same gear semiautomatic rifles until someone came around the corner with sub machine gun and just mow you down but hey i could get over it since it was just the lowly sub machine gun but than all of a sudden i was put in the same match with players with superior gear with one chance of winning a duel cause i was still stuck with the base rifle progression is steep and its meant to be so to incentivise you to buy gold and get that nice gear i wanted to like this game but the user interface unbalanced matchmaking ruined it for me
i have had this game for about two years now its really cool is this similar to min craft yes is it min craft no live seen a lot of updates to the game and the way they re taking the game is really interesting and fun
if a know how to play yugo in oct you re good if not a gonna have a hard time in card rulings player versus player sucks as opponent mod to win during event no japanese audio in steam version
this games tutorial is as much of a joke as its matchmaking and can only be adequately described as an infuriating sack of masochistic glee literally one of the worst gaming experiences i have ever subjected myself to and that includes the one that stabbed me repeatedly with pins
early access review this should be a good game and by all rights it is the game play is fun and the robot design mode usually works properly but there a few major problems worth mention there are a number of methods to get under the map and once there its a simple matter to wipe out the enemy team every ice map has somewhere to get underneath and its extremely frustrating to get destroyed and have the kill cam show the cheater sitting under the game on a huge sheet of ice that stretches the entire map the simple fix for this would be a kill one that stretches underneath insuring that when a cheater manages to get underground it would destroy them and re spawn on a plus side live only seen this on the ice maps some game modes have come and gone and while they were kind of nifty the game has changed to be more focused in their absence however what was unacceptable was the removal of megabits the game has micro transactions and to support the game i was having fun playing i purchased multiple megabits with us dollars a recent patch removed the megabits and gave nothing back the replaced power booster does nothing well of full energy recharge takes eight seconds instead of ten seconds but you never notice unless you took it to the test zone with a stop watch so its not in any way helpful the mega weapons take far too many flops to be placed on a regular bot since if you do it will take six million one thousand five hundred and fifteen flops and then you still need a method of movement and chassis i requested a refund for the ten mega guns and four wheels and three hovers i bought with us after spending forty worth of go they returned two hundred and fifty unacceptable they let you return the mega parts back for the full role play no premium currency but you cant return them for go and all of the cool vanity items are go only i submitted a ticket about it but in not sure if it was answered because i have no idea where their answer would go for me to read it i done even want the money back i just want my go and i think its reasonable that if i bought them with go i should get refunded go old odd glitches in robot builder a number of cheaters and be careful what you spend you money on but otherwise awesome game with active deus worth playing but done spend money in here until those issues are fixed
early access review its fun with friends but that about it it really only takes you a day or two of playing to get access to tanks and planes but then you re up against other people that have been playing longer or paid and have vehicles that stomp you as infantry its frustrating if no one on your team is playing as a pilot or tanker because it usually means that the entire team is nothing but bus dropping bombs on you when you spawn or tanks sniping you from across the map the matchmaking is atrocious in this regard not to mention how long it can take to get into a single match also i know its more of an arcade shooter but its absolutely ridiculous that i need to use an entire thompson magazine to kill a guy or any more than one or two shots from a bolt action rifle plus the recent timoshenko update is terrible the russians are horribly overpowered and you re pretty much guaranteed to lose against them their weapons and vehicles do way more damage than the americans or germans and the russians also get increased capture and spawn speeds then you even have the lack of initiative the developers are taking against hackers probably the worst of it all is there is shockingly little content for how long the game has been in development
early access review so far my favourite game graphics are beautiful controls are easy to use and unlike some people think its not pay to win even buying the most expensive ship doesn't mean you have a ship that better then someone using a starter ship that one thing i love about this game
how to destroy worlds best game over years more precisely gun mettle update ask valve also as long as the pro doesn't get a dramatic nerf this game is unplayable and rage inducing pro totally ruins the games fun and skill fabric as it is designed for low intelligent and low skill players press we to win
i played this game a lot on my phone so i can say that for yugo fans this game can be fun at times as long as you build your deck carefully you get to play as a lot of characters from the anime though some of them i question as they done really fit the whole legendary dualist category kinda like bandit keith hes only been shown in a few episodes and frankly hes kinda underwhelming at best sure he uses machine type monsters but he also cheats at times just to steal a victory not really something a legendary dualist would do as for weevil underwood while having a few interesting cards of his own you can play around with hes also not much of a legendary dualist as bug brain also cheated a few times once by tossing all of yuri motor exod a cards off a boat they were on and for when he tried to fight against joey wheeler in actually surprised that we done get to play as tristan taylor in this game as he had the headed dragon card as a boss monster and while some of his military themed cards weren't the best he could be kinda fun to play around with other characters you wont be able to play as in the game i can think of off the bat chum ley syrup zane true dale rubella tyranny hassle berry attics rhodes and even if he was for an event jesse anderson and maybe just for fun duke devin this is also a good chance for the makers of the card game to look over some of the old archetypes in the game and give them some much needed updates like the new specials we need to have new be more usable with the characters shown on the card as it only affects a few of them it would also be nice if the normal battles we have with the pcs actually had some good card rewards as well as a list of cards we can look at when we battle them it can also be said that we can use more characters to play as even if some of them didst do a whole lot in the anime or comics of which they are from overall the game can be fun at times just done spend too much of your money on it unless its for the special sales they have every now and then all that needed to make it better new cards for the old archetypes that haven been touched in a long time like the new specials i mentioned before or any other archetype that could really use some new cards to give them a much needed boost and relevance in competitive play as well as letting us in the game be able to use the banned cards outside of the player versus player when duelling competitively as well as possible lifting the ban on some of the cards that done really need a ban on them as the newer cards of today outside of this digital game well they can absolutely destroy some of the banned cards without much effort take a look at guardians for a moment and you can tell right away that they need some help as well as a certain spell card unbanned so that we can use the monster its supposed to let us use in the first place the same can be said for a few other archetypes as well other than that i suggest checking it out and hope that in time well be able to get some of the cards we really needed for the archetypes that caught our eyes but didst have the tools needed to be useful on another note whatever you do done use the auto duel function the a i for when you re set to auto duel can and will make so many mistakes it will fail to play certain cards that are in your hand that could of and would of given you a victory if it had just played them or at the very least gave you some breathing room in your duel against your opponent take any field spell card or magical mallet for example you have a good monster out on your side of the field and your opponent has two monsters out one of them being stronger than the other and yours unless you play the field spell you have a field spell card in your hand that can help you out the a i wont play it if you re in auto instead it was attack whatever it can and end your turn leaving you with a monster you could beaten if the a i was smart enough to play it first another example for magical mallet lets say you got a bad hand but have the spell card magical mallet to shuffle it all in your deck and get new cards if you re in auto duel the a i wont play it and just end your turn leaving you wide open for an attack that could very well lead to you losing before you even did anything
early access reviewable request three dimensional will eventually become a great game as artie entertainment is focusing on it a lot hopefully the game keeps developing quickly and reaching its maximum potential
if you wanna play with just four skill slots limited skills you can buy skills or complete skill quests but the quests are long and tedious grinding which takes around two days worth of dungeon stamina to gather necessary materials be my guest as far as all the classes live played each will only stand out and miss out dog if you have enough skills to switch around quick slots are limited to thirty six with the transcendence patch pay to get more skills add in the only good thing about this is that you can relieve your stress on hacking monsters and gritting them to death with full screen damage skill also enjoy watching combo counter on your screen rising that the only thing satisfying for me sometimes you might run into people with classes with are skills you done have and you be like whf i pick this class but that of you can always make a self complain that classes are simba and the game is pay to win or you would run into a badly design boss that would either two shot combo you to death and forced to use resurrection stones then you will wonder how to get more res stones then how to get this and that as you keep further progressing a notice of your inventory is full pops up or your pet is picky and wants al seeds or your stamina runs out or why you keep losing player versus player or why player versus player is so badly match old only play this if you have a clear goal of what you want to do with the game otherwise it would just be as good as any hack and slash genre play with your friends if you have any or good luck making friends with anyone in game laugh out loud is skill slot extension is like ten last time i check you would rather spend that on some other things you like
world of guns what can i say in not a huge fan of guns but bigger fan of games to be honest so a long time ago live started playing this game when it was a much smaller game at the time i liked it but it got boring so quickly because i couldn't have fun memorizing the parts that i was supposed to assemble so long story short i left it nowadays i came back to see what the developers did and made out of the game i was a little bit surprised when the game welcomed me as a newcomer because as i said i did played the game already so my progress whipped out of well i personally left the game on the third gun i think so i want that upset about it like the other ones who actually loved this game and spent hours of their lifetime assembling guns when i was searching for the next gun to check i was shocked how much models they created to assemble not minding the fact that i was only be able to play with two the tutorial one and an another on so recommending this game would be misleading for those who following my reviews because dear game developers making us players redo the tutorial is of but whipping our progress and our achievements this is one of that kind of wound that gonna remain in the hearts of your old fans forever
so team fortress two he this amazing idiotic and genuinely crazy first person shooter is something set out from the crowd i can almost one hundred guarantee that you will not find a shooter game even perpetually close to how insane this game is with nine classes and probably about seventy unique weapons feb two thousand and sixteen you will never and i mean never become bored because of all the different class and weapon combinations be them stupidly over powered or just flat out derby now you may say of yea counter strike go is better because it has skins well no more because since the gun mettle and tough break updates came out all the stock weapons have at least one resin apart from a few things like the sapper and pads with hundreds of community created content pieces and regular updates in sure team fortress two will stay popular for years to come is valve we better get more free stuff on scream fortress and miss as this year a mAy
this is in the top two tags for me recently i switched to mtg arena from eternal but it is still a good game i have played all of the major tags hearthstone yes legends mtg arena other tags yes legends offers competitive remade decks that are affordable which would be helpful for this game as well mtg arena allows you to gain premium currency in game without spending girl money through draft wins only tag that allows you to do this that i know of eternal offers twitch drops which do something similar but no one wants to watch twitch streams for drops they want to play the game hearthstone jul good stuff free promo cards most single player content of any tag you keep the cards you draft this is also the case in mtg arena packs contain a lot of cards bad stuff if you done log in during the time period for a promo you have to craft them to get them not available in packs too many cards for new players to learn four sets in standard promos cards from four campaigns i haven heard any plans to rotate sets draft only offers two base packs and two packs of the newest set which is good another set is coming december two thousand and eighteen campaigns are too expensive to reasonably afford without paying girl money getting campaigns with gold is also a waste as you can draft forty five times for the same price single player forge mode is a lot worse than the multiplayer draft version single player rewards are a bit lacking in general no real reason or incentive to buy packs just rare draft or join a league draft is a gold for four packs and you can rare draft league is a gold for fourteen packs packs are one thousand gold each overall would recommend for single player game play you are going to get destroyed online as a new player same as every other tag is plus add linux version December
this game truly is one of the worst free to plays out there it has every horrible thing from every horrible free to play game there is you want to play only so much then you have to wait you want that tank cool play thirty games or pay some money you want another tank slot take two for in game currency then everything after that you have to pay real money for you want to pay some real money cool you get jack for it old bad free to play that all but requires real money transactions and you get every little for what you get even when you do pay
detailed guns and repetitive music creates a drug like atmosphere it made me feel like in a gun cleaner for a mafia which gives you drugs as payment and make you work under music so that you hear no conversation very fun tho
early access review hats all as far as pros cons if the pay to win int there and they make the changes on the above mention then yea it could possibly be good all the stuff i mentioned is from the rebuilt version tho so i dunno i might play it if they fix the stuff and people are playing but it will be on the download should you guys play it though yeah man why not int else to play
is this game free to play yes is it easier than personal computer version yes is there less cancer in this version of tanks apart from arty everything else is the same teams tang and cancerous tanks is this game playable yes but only if you are in a platoon with broken tanks overall not worth the headache just play something else
i want this game to be something but it really lacks in so many areas it has potential but to bring it up to speed is going to way too much work the deus might as well stop developing it and start over graphics and sounds are numb and make the immersive ness quite ill the player movement feels like a cheap web browser based game or kind of like rob lox wait times are quite high for such short and unrewarding and or satisfying however this game is free i would just say that the deus are very new to developing
the game seems pretty cool but the problem is the ban system i started playing the game ten minutes ago and entered a server the chat was full of bans and i didst understand i changed my server and i got automatically banned and id why this needs some remaking in the game now i am permanently banned and i done know why
have one hundred and fifty in this game with gear be deeply depressed buy one chaos chest to suppress your sad feelings get an item worth almost a money in game buy best gear get bored twenty minutes later best game
early access review overall its a pretty cool game live just started playing it a few days and in already hooked i play it any chance i get for being early access there is a lot of different game modes and maps to play if you haven tried it yet have at it and give the game a try you never know you might just like it i give the game a one thousand and ten rating
i need help it says program stopped working when i tried playing it like i press play and there a startup screen then i try moving around and stuff by clicking on it then it says program has stopped working
early access review while i do think its a good idea that this type of game gets more attention this is not the game to get it well without about sixty eight months more work that is no actual story line trying to follow that leads to a dead end the only quests they seem to have fully worked out are ones that are boringly repetitive or simply end in the middle lost of markers for things that are in development in fact more than are anywhere near complete give it about six months as i plan to do then check in with it again as it stands though do not spend any money on this game make them actually produce a somewhat even for early access this is respectable product that has put more money into play time development rather than store purchases old cash sink with no real content
i spent three hundred then quit one thousand and ten bow i have way by more hours done play on steam for less lag get the actual glyph launcher also the second video trailer atm says endless worlds although all worlds have a set limit well they are all islands and the ocean will you up if a go in it if you done listen to me and decide to play in telling you now choose knight
this is the worst good game live ever played the level of detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible the fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof the fact that you can use machine guns as air brakes the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are destructible and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour the fact is however that literally everything about the game that int the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable everything above battle royal is takes millions of years to unlock even when playing with a premium account you re looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semi modern tank if you done have parts and you get tracked you wont be able to move for the rest of the game whether you get to re spawn or not is decided by how many spawn points you've earned you earn spawn points for killing the enemy so whatever side wins the initial engagement always wins the rest of the game if you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo you need to land on an air field and repair and refit i can count on one hand the amount of times live had time to get back to the map after rating because the matches are incredibly short if your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to re spawn you cant choose to not re spawn because you'll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points why done you just spawn and die then because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money at mid repairs get insanely expensive it is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money there hast been any changes to the above for the two years live been playing
played this game a lot before it came to steam an excellent choice for card game if you re looking for something fresh the lane rune and colour mechanics are all refreshing for the genre
best realistic combat sim out there ever done waste your time buying the steam version go to their website make an account and get it there play the open beta and you'll have access to things a long time before they come to steam id why people are so obsessed with buying if its not on steam i done play it get over it plus you get bonus credit to your account to use on later modules most of the do no recommend votes are because its steam related or regarding prices go to their website and get the sales they have if you re that picky this is the best combat sim out there and really has no reason for any negative reviews other than the potato personal computer users complain they cant run it yes it requires tracker of some sort yes it requires you to learn an aircraft to be good with it yes you need to have some sort of stick and rudder these are all things that should be standard if you re wanting to play this game go play fax if you wanna fuck around jump in fire up and do flybys all day these aircraft take years of development to get to working order and i have nothing but great things to say about this game
its perfect game for every hack and slash fans in my opinion this game have everything what diabolo three doesn't have plot are a little bit short but for me it was exciting there are a few drawbacks like graphic or music which becomes tiresome and game play is a little bit hard for new players but we can expect everything from free too play game i recommend this game only for advanced players i really enjoy this title and i think a lot of people will agree with me
if you want a challenging massively multiplayer online i would recommend this they upgraded the free to play feature as well so its more viable now every fight could be your last this int kiddie mode and is actually challenging

welcome back to never winter is about to hit the fan this is a my game set in the world of wizards of the coasts dungeons and dragons world in the area that they call never winter you start of in a stranded ship and from there on you go into the capital of never winter to follow your quest and get new ones even though this is just another massively multiplayer online game set in a medieval era style it is amazing i had a lot of fun playing this massively multiplayer online and i really got the dungeons and dragons feel just as i have while playing the normal do game the atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand for new and for experienced players the game has also other things that are better than most mos for example in most mos you just do your quest and level your character in do never winter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do another great thing about this game is that the combat is more action orientated you do not use a key to switch between your targets you really have to aim for them before you do your attack that is in my opinion much better next to that it doesn't really matter if you play this game alone or with friends one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing this story short it is amazing so just play this game
early access review its alpha so there are some bugs and occasionally latency issues that being said this game is already very fun and already has a ton of potential tried for it hated the building played a lot of pub fun for a while but playing thirty minutes not seeing anyone and then getting head shot by a guy that happened to be looking in your direction was pretty lame it is so refreshing to play a fast paced battle royal game the fights feel like fights intense fast paced and dynamic
pros graphics while not a triple next gen its still considerably good looking for the older be they us controls uses typical first person shooter was one four ability keys for a third person type of sub genre in mob sui while not the most insane live seen its reasonably well made and easy to find what you need performance runs very well even on max when using even a mid tier gaming reggae play the game really does take the mombasa gunfighter genres and mashes them william model free to play as with all mobs smite is not pay to win but you can buy skins for real cons servers they can run great some days and the next be dial up hosted in africa remote desert balance while not usually over the top some short long term balance issues can arise matchmaking can like most of the cons be or not be bad depending on your days luck community again will ont be toxic but my advice is keep to yourself say good game and leave the lobby my advice is give it a go invite some buddies and mess around you might just stick around after live spent two thousand hours in the game so far and many more off of steam since twenty twelves closed beta and haven actually spent even one penny on the game so if you find spending sixty us or more for a triple a game that lasts two thousand and thirty hours till you uninstall a good deal then two thousand hours without even using a single penny must make you explode in happiness
great game incredibly in depth passive skill tree that leads to great build diversity and lots of interesting unique items that can change the way you play the skill gems are a really interesting mechanic and with support gems you can play with them in some really fun ways
data was my favourite in the last seventy eight years till the now i want to install we and play data again i guess that is my only chance to get the data feeling again it is not data since seven hundred they should change its name rip data
used to like this game good concept brings people from across the world to duel too bad kenai is a money hungry company their nick name is a money for a reason random time limit loss leg you are winning are a turn away from winning with one hundred and fifty seconds left on the timer and you lose for no reason and a little message comes up lost due to time limit loss the fact that updates a rent mandatory what game lets two different updates exist side by side in their game and play with each other like whf are you stupid three that time a couple months back when you could summon enemy controller spell card as a monster drop hackers using modded ask meta that favours buying new boxes basically as soon as they come out the only useless box so far has been six samurai box free to play pay to win you can free play but you have to research what cards to get randomly buying a bunch of random packs will set you back in player versus player where you will plate and you will be stuck playing against artificial intelligence which is horrible cause player versus player gives you access to card tickets and more rewards these problems existed from game start
in sparta pepperoni revenant class nerved valorous vial rip class unlocking rip made it harder to solo dungeons because of damned powered rank we int buying your pack mate would play again to get rest
if you think this game is pay town then you are most likely wrong about almost everything in this game is craft able there is no story at all and this game is mostly about dungeon hunting but three dimensional and kinda like min craft
i was very patient and decided to give this game a try despite all the negativity surrounding it and unfortunately bless online is just not a good game this is a game that has been rerelease about thirty four times already and is running on an outdated engine that said this game runs like crap in talking about single digits in crowded areas and dips to fps in uncrowded areas on all settings cranked up to max or one step below max four or five in fed on a gtd nine hundred and eighty which is disappointing to say the least black desert online on remastered full per on shades tons of post processing this is epic ultra settings and its gorgeous in a at at least thirty frames per second on the same hardware i did mention that this game was rerelease after many failures so choosing to reuse the same exact engine and maps with their horrible optimization is not only inexcusable it is a disgrace to game development what of the other aspects of the game the textures are okay in some parts of the game but reply ugly in other parts the starting area for the lupus is absolutely godawful looking the questing is abysmal eighty of the quest is fly to this zone talk to that pc with the occasional kill quest and the combat rhythmic as its called is basically just single mob targeting with a two key combo spam its very boring and static and i nearly fell asleep trying to play the game i tried to diversify the game play by playing first as a lupus berserker then a sylvan elf archer but both played nearly the same with the exception that the archer can attack from a range but cannot dodge so its pretty pointless i can name a few redeeming qualities some of the assets of the game like the architecture is beautiful the capital city is breathtaking the environment is ugly though and looks like it was build using a free tool on the unreal asset store the character creator is also diverse and well made with millions of unique customizations possible it doesn't allow for the level of customization of black deserts but i think its much better than dos finally the out composed by hans simmer and his protege is great i find it hard to believe people would pay one hundred for a founders pack for this game let alone defend its scummy developers and really lacklustre game play its funny that be wiz has basically shown us all that early access official release doesn't mean considering this game is not ready in fact its an early build of the game from another region it was released in sons ago so we are literally playing with junkyard scraps i might be able to take the game more seriously if they made much needed improvements like moving to unreal four or redoing the combat like their new title bless unleashed which was funded by gullible fanboys of this game but i wouldn't hold my breath i wouldn't be surprised if they ended support for the game before shuttering its online services altogether if bless unleashed is successful
early access review its so sad developers pull like this nowadays the current player base of rob craft will never know how good rob craft was before the deus just said fucking it and added all the crap that currently in the game looting system pay to win it center this game was a solid one thousand and ten a couple of years ago and now its just a stinking pile of money grabbing i thought free am was better than this
cant walk outside your spawn without being shot by five different types of tanks until you get a plane then you ram it into the tanks and your team hates you for wasting a plane and killing them one thousand and ten
early access review this game is basically pay to win everything in this game is expensive and when you join a class it costs the same price to rejoin it if you leave when you join a session with tanks prepared to get spawn trapped by tanks because they re insanely overpowered also if you enjoy having no control over what you want in game planes no planes it center then this game is for you at the start it is very fun but then it turns to when you face the stronger soviets and have to play alongside cod and counter strike players who only give a about getting kills and done give a rats about the objective overall this game will anger you and generally make you want to massacre your entire family while they sleep burn down the house to dispose of the evidence say you got out in a hurry when you smelled the smoke cry fake tears when the insurers come to rule out foul play and live the rest of your life with a infertile mother named margaret and a priest called francis a so doesn't even deserve a number as a score
good game if you want to rage a lot and suffer from stupid server lag all the time of and also it seems like re tomato seems to favor the soviet faction cause they have way too overpowered default came they are practically invisible in the forests and in any vegetation conclusion you want to rage then this is the game to go for do not play germans i wasted over hrs grinding my german characters only to get them completely nerved i actually spent money on this stupid game i have no idea how could live been so dumb developers on any new ideas by the community crying about the game having to be reprogrammed completely all they do is add all updates and just rake money with both hands german faction is now dying thanks to all nerds towards germans and buffs to soviets and us yea soviet and us fanboys keep crying about germans being overpowered of they re not even close to being as good as soviets and us now there are close to no good players left in germans only holds who just run towards tanks attempting to blow them up apparently heavy armoured tanks get blown up by a few little at grenades whf ret heavy tanks cost a lot to spawn in germans have weapons germans done have good vehicles germans done have this and that i could go on with this for the whole day but is easier to say that reno hates german faction i hope they realise that they are just on the game with those new useless docs like seriously veteran membership costs way too much for its useless boosts game has lag and performance issues and all they do is host those live streams with new useless content that keeps getting worse they are clearly out of ideas who the fun asked for useless pocket pistols or whatever they are completely and utterly useless reno is by far the worst game company no community ideas are implemented no one in the support team gives a fun about the issues that players have they done offer any good suggestions on how to fix the problem and they keep cranking out bad updates with tons of bugs and keep on nursing germans with every update good game reno
live been playing the world of tanks series of games started out with normal world of tanks for the personal computer calling worm for now for almost six years and world of tanks blitz is quite a fun replacement i lost my interest in worm because of the very broken artillery mechanic and yes i used the arty as well and found it quite broken although they claimed to have changed it but i am sceptical and when i was watching videos on world of tanks blitz it had no arty in it whatsoever and i decided to try it out and i found it to be quite fun and i have been playing it nonstop ever sense pros smaller matches compared to worm means quicker grinding for tank lines and sometimes comical more chaotic battles new equipment system many players will disagree with my statements and that is fine and yes although the old equipment system was very good the new one is even better in my eyes and i will say at first i absolutely hated it the new system allows players to mount nine different equipment types on there tanks and all it takes is some grinding for spare parts many players think the old one is better most likely because all the needed to do was grind inc in game credits but it only allowed us to mount three equipment types total and some classes of tank such as tier five tanks wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered namely the gun stabilizer which in the old system could only be mounted in tier eight tanks and now can be mounted on almost any tier tons of tanks to choose that fit most play styles there are tons of tanks in here just like worm bar arty if you want quick zippy deadly tanks go down light tank paths if you want a balance of power go for medium tanks if you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims go for tank destroyers and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your arm or go for heavy tanks and as the game is still improving just like worm more tanks are in the future good graphics and game play nothing much to say although they are not as he as worm for bottom diamond systems somewhat like mine they are perfect but i am not into games for fancy graphics i play for game play cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches cons smaller matches compared to worm although it has its perks if you come from worm you might have some withdrawals from the old a and have to deal with the seven a seven spare parts system although the new equipment system is good i will say that the spare parts system is somewhat flawed we should at least earn one thousands spare parts for a victory and maybe two hundred and fifty for a loss live only won about three hundred for a victory this makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying the only way to get more than one thousand spare parts is to complete missions but these reset only every one thousand two hundred and twenty four hours forgot which laugh out loud to be honest people the new equipment system really is awesome but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truly effective update three hundred and ten claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle overpowered tanks although a somewhat realistic feature example a tiger ii in real life would blow away a sherman no problem many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are some notable tanks are the leopard light tank of tier five of of tier six let of tier seven to name a few what makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal the leopard only had two variants built in real life so not much is known about it the of in game can one shot anything at tier six and below when using the my gun however in real life this thing couldn't even turn its turret when it was on a hill let reportedly broke its suspension when travelling over rough terrain the let is also a light tank and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and arm or yet it has my of hull arm or i done think it should be moving that fast perhaps why it failed in real life however these tanks are luckily not without flaws leopard has a long clip reload and poor armonk has an insanely long reload upwards of twenty seconds and the let is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot there is also somewhat of a russian bias with this game and many of the russian tanks are quite overpowered and seemingly the german tanks are underpowered even though a real scenario would have the german tanks with the upper hand depending on the crew with a few exceptions on tanks luckily this bias int as great as it is in some games though and yes i am partial to german tanks but i also use british american and russian so this is from personal experience the new military honor system absolute in my eyes live been having some stability issues with my computer so sometimes my computer will crash during game play and i done exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig luckily i might know the problem and am fixing it but because of this new military honor system you re honor stars go down because random players think you re betting or a king when you could have issues like i am experiencing in my eyes this system needs a major reworking or removal and my final and main issue with the game no three man platoons like normal worm i understand that seven a seven might be difficult to have three man platoons but we need something cause two man platoons is just too small all i can really say about that honestly we should start a petition on world of tanks blitz for three man platoons for those that agree with this another thing for new players is done judge the game until you re at least at tier five and this goes for worm as well live seen too many people quit because they done invest the time into learning this game its not just point and click and get a kill unless you re an old arty or of then it sometime is there is tons of mechanics in the game for arm or a skill called side scraping and many other things that will help you survive in battle learn you tank too a panzer in will have a completely different play style than at heavy or of these are all tiers too so not comparing two different tiers use youtube for education and training and you might enjoy this game more note these are all my opinions ignore misspellings it center and that concludes this long winded review
early access review have a fair amount of time invested in the game played off and on for over a year now and enjoyed it early on but there are some things that have turned me off completely and the biggest of those is the a hole that work for free am read for yourself then you decide if you want to help them be successful as i will never look at another game that this company makes a long as such bags like this work and speak for the company tips twitter
easier to play and more competitive than the original wot pc pros more competitive cheaper in game prices name currencies are easier and cheaper to acquire less painful spotting systems all memory sidelight system requirements tier difference per match is only eleven compared to wot pcs twenty two and on some tanks even cons harder to grind tanks since the experience points distribution per kills caps it center are the same so killing the entire enemy here is just a regular seven kills on wot personal computer looking by the experience points gains far less tanks than the original wot pc since almost every tank is used rather frequently by other players due to the limitations of tank choice ace tankers are far harder to gain on wot personal computer rarely afters and wallet warriors make a difference in here one tank makes all the difference in the world get the reference neutral no art galleries if you like to play art galleries then wacky a a a shit shit if you play heavy tanks than this is a real nice stuff to hear armour thickness indicators its good to have arm or penetration indicators so you can easily see if its a fight or if its a flight situation but since the enemy can use the same arm or thickness indicators on you you better play it smart rip a less players per team per match if you re the type of player that can bring strategies and tactics for your teammate to achieve victory then this is a real good stuff to hear but on the other side less teammates means less chance of victory when your team unluckily die somewhat arc dish style of game play also quicker matches if you re the type of player who likes to play a quick game before switching to another one then this is for you seven minutes max per match usually its done in forty five minutes on the other side if you re the one who likes to take time doing damages little by little then its a big problem for you since the match would be over in no time anime tones this is pretty self explanatory basically if you like anime you'll have the chance to drive anime tanks on some occasions if you re an anti anime then you could throw up playing this since up tanks are often encountered here nameless is a nice anime heavy tank rather cartoonish graphics compared to the personal computer version this means that the graphics are polished off to give the game a lighter feeling and weight its nice for a phone game let alone seeing it in a but compared to wot pcs ultra or even war thunders high its far behind ill give this seven thousand five hundred and ten based by how light and little the game is this game could run on potatoes have somewhat similar game play to the actual personal computer version and is not bad on the graphics side however the significantly less number of tanks and nations means you have less choice on tanks
my suggestion first of all is it worth it downloading it really is it is free and also small in size it is really addictive so i suggest you download it what do i do in this game it is a two dimensional fighter game in the online mode you can fight in two versus twos and one versus ones and also a free for all which can hold four people it is like a both king of the hill game but with a twist every player has a damage bar the redder it is the more knock back the player takes it has a lot of modes the main one is the one with stocks usually three stocks stocks lives you can also use thongs of characters you need to buy them can i play with my friend yes you can if you want to host your own custom room you can play with seven other people but you cannot play ranked with more then two people overall rating nine hundred and ten i hope this helped a lot of you peace
because of asset to cora i was very optimistic about indie racing simulators and this game was free so i thought id try it out it turns out its merely a premium game with full on micro transactions and you cant do anything in the game besides doing practice on one track with one car without paying money its essentially the real racing three of computers except real racing three allows you to progress through the game without micro transactions and offers much more without paying a cent lets talk about the game itself the physics kinda work but the car feels slippery much like a bar of soap and the graphics are representative of a phone game no not even real racing three looks much better especially the interior view of the car is very messy and poorly textured at best is it a bad game not necessarily in guessing the game is merely developing but i feel that it is not worth playing let alone spending money on at this state definitely get asset to cora instead it looks great even in alpha state and it looks like the developers really care rather than this payt haven affair or if you re broke and need a free racing game id recommend trackman a nations forever which has course creators and frantic online multiplayer or even the demo of grid two which has online multiplayer
early access review great game like the fact that its not all about having ninja like reflexes if you got a brain learn the maps and get experience you are going to own all the counter strike go kids
great realism detailed terrain loads of different aircraft to fly lots of ground forces to obliterate easy to join make servers and fly with others extensive mission editor interactive tutorials definitely would recommend having a good joystick otis setup helps a lot but even with a simple joystick its playable
i would love this game so much if only i could control it seriously in not sure if its just me but every time i play this game i can control my character for a minute then for whatever reason i no longer control my character my character just goes where ever the which often ends with death making it impossible to proceed to the next class in this game they need to fix this because at the moment its impossible to play until this is fixed this int getting any thumbs up from me
early access review its okay not great try adventure quest worlds its better and if you done like two dimensional play a wow ripoff there are hundreds of them or try rift if you a rent specifically looking for free try tsp the secret world or wow both are pretty good or try trove or something but give this a try its okay
early access review remember that time when you were playing a game and thought that this game needs a lot more mindless action and fighting so now you have it and you done even need to pay for it review legends the legends have repetitive weapons but each one of them have their own unique skills with them but unfortunately there as always those guys spamming spear rotation to not let you get back in the arena the legends are completely free money you just need to play a lot to buy the one you want the game has a weekly rotation of legends so you can play with pm all without even buying them arenas the arenas are kinda simple with some of them that actually has some feature or other the game itself got kinda of seventy eight arenas but they all could get an upgrade and new features all the arenas are spear spamming friendly but with the right momentum you can just tell the sheet head to go away with a punch in his head skins the game gives you the opportunity to have all the legends with only playing the game but the skins just with mammoth coins translating real cash i kinda think this is good because you will only buy the ones you like for the ones you play but there should be another way to get them not like counter strike global offensive with crates and sheet but kinda a present al month listing that if you get all days in game you could trade for a skin buyout that just me game play consist of the couch the single player the online and the ranked the cool part of them all is not that you just play by yourself this game brings back the good of same screen coop game play meaning you can add more than one player in one personal computer for me this is actually awesome the game consist in killing everybody else in the arena be it in teams or a free oral all legends have two weapons and can still just brawl their brains out with their fists end for all of you whom are reluctant to play this i shall tell you lets freaking explode their brains with freaking massive rocket spears
i left this game in my library for months in the hopes that the payment system would change as i loved the games graphics and open world feel when i first played it so long ago yet here i am many months later writing this review still uses a ridiculous subscription based pay all system if they ever add a system that allows you to progress without having to bring in a dump truck filled to the brim with wads of cash i might leave a good review but for now its probably best that i finally delete this from my library
i used to love this game if you want to play a game that dying and gives you fun until you die due to hackers then be my guest in not going to go off on a rage against kab am and them buying the game because honestly i know they re money hungry but who int a a a a a a i would milk the a a a a out of this game until the money runs out because i would be surprised if this game lasts another year or two
early access review a great experience been since the start proud to be part of this idea working hard on some balances going back and forth on changes listening to community and keeping the game updated will definitely be a great release once they finish tuning extreme imbalances between classes is the new update for seven million forty two thousand and eighteen made the game kinda annoying on solo missions with grown he the rest is just great good fun mostly in co overpowered games soloing gets boring after a few victories and shenanigans
early access review it was a perfect game nothing was messed up and no matter how each update messed up the game it want that bad then this new epic loot update dropped and everything went to hell guns fire at stupid slow speed weapon damage balances got screwed and most of all when you buy in game boxes with real money they done show up and get lost in the system it is definitely very disappointing so see a game that was so much fun at twenty fourteen get messed up so badly by just one update i think my outmost verdict of this game is that good of free am finally broke the game so badly that to save it they have to roll back the entire update guess it was a matter of time as free am has been breaking this game for quite some time
early access review this is my official review of adventure quest three dimensional a game by a artie entertainment for personal computer and mobile this is a giant pile of i done know how it could of possibly been made worse than adventure quest worlds but you managed so congratulations artie i have experienced a lot of mos but with a bad and clunky combat system like this really bad player systems which could be easily exploited and just an utter and boring grind est to the point where to evening play the game you need to turn off your brain and put it into robot mode it becomes a bit annoying to say the least maybe the first five minutes was enjoyable after that nothing the combat in the game has four classes which one is for founders only warrior rogue mage guardian for founders all of these classes have five basic moves that cant be upgraded or changed at all and are boring basic unoriginal abilities that can be from almost any massively multiplayer online or any kind of role playing game game by the way the one ability is your basic attack so there technically its also point and click targeted combat which int bad but its so clunky and just boring to where you can just sit there spamming two abilities that you prefer and win without even having to think about it removes any challenge from a game which is something that a game needs to be entertaining in my opinion also the game is a total grind est there is nothing to do other than kill monsters ninety nine of the quests are killing monsters too you figure they at least do one thing in this game justice but they really didst for exploiting all you got to do is go into high level areas accept a quest because there no level or any kind of restriction to accepting quests and walk over and hit a monster once that someone else is attacking run away and you'll get experience when it dies rinse and repeat the variation of clothing armour in the game there are very few and then a bunch of others which are recovers of the very few of and did i mention to craft them you got to go to a crafting person make sure you have the materials then spend gold to craft your item and that it also has a crafting time you can spend real life money to decrease the crafting time seriously this game is utter garbage to think this came from the creator of the original adventure quest is really sad and the fact that this was released in twenty seventeen is honesty laughable it feels like a ripoff of a ripoff if you enjoy brainless grin fests then pick this game up if not steer away two hundred and ten
early access review recommended to me by a friend he said that he got it a year ago and it was barely playable back then but now its pretty awesome as far as in concerned its a bit like league of legends meets eve online without the a one hundred a year subscription the graphics look pretty sweet and there no evidence of pay to win which is great its more pay to get something that looks cool but is really difficult to use and there a no premium version of the vehicle anyway so yeah really nice and fair despite me struggling at the game because its very heavily tactics based and i struggle with working with a team over the internet a still best purchase of twenty sixteen in my opinion actually no best purchase live made on steam for a very long time buy it buy it but it three
early access review this is a game that almost manages to look worse then it runs almost questing boring and level gaps where you have to grind a of mobs to fill experience in order to move to next quest chain and grind the very same solo dungeon seemingly endlessly but hey there cool dungeon traps besides the game itself being a trap premium bonus your founders pack has junk that only lasts thirty days including the skins for mounts gathering besides there being maybe four graphics between what nodes look like you also have to buy harvesting tools which expire per harvest like go and it takes too long maybe helped by better tools though still annoying character creation very fun classes limited as of right now there are only four playable with warlock and mystic being locked bummer combat about as fun as tab targeting the wrong mob that instantly re spawns and pressing one or tone by to while strafing so you done get murdered by other things that instantly re spawn controller not supported kill tree holy crap convoluted and unforgiving while also not really giving you a whole lot of variety especially at low levels nothing is new its just recycled abilities from most the classes you find in a game like wow which is standard in most mos however having a limited action bar makes everything rely on combos which each ability gets levelled with gems you earn from levelling and each ability seems to have a limited amount of combo sets you'll probably just use what you start with level that and not even touch anything else because it will be too expensive to experiment
early access review an of man this game has some serious potential and i do believe artie entertainment will fulfill every bit of it in making aqua three dimensional i followed this game back when it was just an idea that had a few posts about it and ever since then live always had hope for this to be a thing i myself had played and upgraded in all of artie entertainments games i actually started personal computer gaming as a whole around the same time i began playing their games back in early two thousand and seven live enjoyed every single game they developed and i can guarantee that this will be no exception as of now this game is worthy enough to invest numerous hours into and its only in early access done look at my hours i played before aqua three dimensional was even green it on steam so if you get the chance play this game you wont regret it
unbalanced game the british tanks in the middle of the research are mostly after ii world war tanks and the soviet ii world war tanks can use after war ammunition the british tanks in tier four have antitank rockets and on the german side you have only tiger and panther no chance in the beginning it was a good game on the moment it is only pay and win tactic
game is good considering you can get free gems just but not playing the game after a couple of months then you can go back into the game and get the free gems cause of the events in your mail even if you haven played for a while yes if you use girl your going to get better cards faster but it doesn't matter the fact that you can even get free gems after a while of not playing the game just log in now and then and they will give you free gems in your mailbox
early access review way better than footnote in every way compared to pub though tough to say as of writing this i have only played a few matches but absolutely loved it so far will update later but it is free if your personal computer can run it just try it out and stop wasting your time reading reviews
live been playing this game since its first release the game back then was awful i a not going to lie although through the years of playing this game there have been many different releases and failed attempts to make this game good this version of the game on the other hand i have very little to complain about this is the only version that has hackers somewhat under control and is actively trying to work and make this game great give this game a chance and support the game like i said i be been playing this version before the steam version was even released and it has improved ten fold this game will continue to improve and i hope it will be successful i highly recommend this game to anyone

early access review good old artie entertainment is at it again releasing an unfinished game and seeing what comes out of it its fun though play it casually on your phone or something done take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it
its free play very full featured and a ton of fun if you like fantasy mos uses the dungeons dragons fourth edition rules which actually work a lot better as a computer game than they do in the pen paper game the combat is surprisingly robust much more interactive than in a typical massively multiplayer online it uses reticule targeting rather than tab targeting and that a lot more interesting the big bonus is the builtin foundry editor which allows any user to create their own quests so there a huge amount of user generated content some of it very good indeed overall its currently my go to massively multiplayer online and i recommend it highly
mostly like hearthstone but they brought in an interrupt instant mechanic which slows stuff down immensely and requires everyone to always pay attention when its not their turn avoiding that at all costs no matter how difficult it was to keep the game deep was perhaps the genius masterstroke of hearthstone and its completely baffling that legends would try to turn back the clock on that normally this wouldn't be so much of a deal breaker but legends is so similar to hearthstone in design that it forces comparison and must necessarily beat hearthstone at its own game which it doesn't
early access review when i saw this on the upcoming games i didst know what to expect but this must be the best jumps are game i ever played really this must be the only game where you can get scared with cute car box cut outs and there are so many references to other horror games its really nice to see all of them right now i am in room four hundred after almost died because a cute jelly car box popped out the wall while i was being chased and let go of my mouse because of the shock this is way better than any game where you just sit there waiting to get scared one thousand and ten
good game even with the card that you cant get unless you pay the meta still one hundred free you can go to the top just using free things the events are pretty constant too so you done get bored too easily
early access review those guys saying this game is pay to win to haven you played adventure quest worlds i already know its gonna be pay to win but you can still have fun what i done like now the experience so low and there is no map also the quests are too hard or long in still level five but the quests required two thousand and thirty kills please fix it
this is the best first person shooter game out there in many ways it has literally hundreds of players fighting across several whole continents massive tank battles fifty player dogfights and so much more the progression system is sometimes tedious especially when you stop getting the one hundred cert rank bonus but it does prioritize teamwork the biggest and most important thing to do as soon as you can is to join an outfit i am a proud member of the phoenix battalion no east coast server and have served in several of the largest battles so far being with a group of well organised well led players is one of the best things about his game it is amazing and even better its free get it
its like someone out there decided to just make an excellent game release it for free and then the only money involved is cosmetics and absolutely zero pay to win aspects kept it updated balanced and added neat seasonal intrigue and ladders and rankings and then actually did everything i just said
well live been playing this game till level five and my experience so far has been like this pros the graphics are pretty decent combat system is pretty cool movement is smooth and nice cons frame drops almost every tenth second during video sequences the audio comes later than the actual video which makes it pretty stupid and hilarious got a high end personal computer but the game is really bad optimized that in sitting on five thousand and sixty frames all the time for now i do not recommend the game to anyone a game like this should have been optimized before the actual release but does it have potential hell yes
once this was a promising game but the developers have driven it into the abyss too many changes in the game play and no proper road map made the game a sandbox for the developers the performance is not satisfactory and the networking is modest too so if you like a dead game with performance problems and no future then this is just what you are looking for they had a road maps but changing the whole game is not like updates should be
product received for free recommend this game for short plays but in the long run it may not be worth it i have four hundred hours and it want really worth my while edit over nine hundred hours now but i stopped playing time to time it is a fun and addictive game without a doubt its just when you hit that level ninety you will be grinding for experience and having really good gear is essential to delete the mobs before they chip he to he every time you get caught having potions site events etc is always needed for underpowered gear the most overpowered players you see are the ones that played over a few thousands of hours into the game to get very strong gear majority of dedicated players and there takers including me that gear is below nine and put few to none effort for dedicated daily weekly monthly grinding for the best gear bank trial and error events and skin stacking stats even tho i have over nine hundred hours i mostly just hang around play events try all characters and some grind here and there at most i spent fifty in this game to speed up third job quest bank share and rewards to other players that i promised good game its been a fun odd crazy ride for three years i may jump back maybe in a long time and one more thing i accidentally burned one hundred us dollars for a in game player so i told him to gift me costume sets for rena and asia stats of the costume are not worth and is was valued twenty five thirty us dollars for a freaked set pay to wins just a allusion for no veterans real money only gives costumes less time for class job grinding and few bonus stats the real power comes from knowing the game system by heart and freaked dedication involving a lot of trial and error when the odd are greatly against achieving level ninety nine peeps and gear people with nine are the unlucky climbing player people with ten are the unlucky dedicated player people with eleven grinding carries anyone with twelve the richest of play grind to win becomes work the chosen ones of ave for massive love for the game edit nine million one hundred and twelve thousand and eighteen still playing and achieved one thousand hours of play time for steam record now over two hundred and fifty in this game so far may
a great old school massively multiplayer online role playing game it still has high system requirements but most shouldn't have a problem with it it is a gorgeous game with very in depth lore you cant get any better than that for old school either
when this game first came out it was amazing so much do it in the game but that when the game first came out whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours ill go into more detail on the cons near the end pros great fun with friends if you re all new to the game the massive range of items in the game how they submit workshop creations into the game they keep updating this game and adding more content a a new classes this game is free two play cons the grinding in this game is stupidly longing me purchase quickly gets boring if you re a casual player okay the reason why in not going to be going into the pros into more detail as they re self explained from my view but ill be going over the cons as quite a large range of people whole played this game have encountered this problem as i have first con the grinding if you re a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grind est this game is this con is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end okay once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first four hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it until you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid second con with the in game purchases this is completely optional but what the in game purchases give you are quite stupid but the in game purchases you done have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see a lot of reviews saying pay two play in my opinion i done see the game as pay two play as i haven spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from third con if you re a casual player like me you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take a lot of your time a a the grinding in this game in not saying its a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added which i think a few have encountered i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game my final opinion i recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which int a bad thing what i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it will help the game progression for players which done have the sort of time like others thank you for reading my review
this game used to be fantastic but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment to put this perspective for any new or current players foreigner have become even breeder than war gaming creates world of tanks and that is saying a lot as they have a certain reputation every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however most if not all are overpriced premiums lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pitiful amount of experience gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles and sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as a lot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehash of old planes or tanks already in the game honestly give this game a miss all my a hours were played back during the golden age of the game before the a a a a a a a a battle royal system and questionable design choices
early access review played a couple quick tournaments against bots so far i really like what live seen took me less than a half hour to feel like i really had a command of the movement controls will take a little longer to get used to the characters signature weapons but its fun to learn each one some cool design decisions lots of recovery options so you can almost always get where you want to go on the stage but if you get hit you get hit pretty hard each character has two weapons available so you can switch your move set mismatch item spawns willing to try to improve your matchup matches tend to be pretty fast and fun its free give it a try if you like it play more and possibly give pm moneys
early access review eternal is a very interesting card game that really feels like the best of both worlds magic and hearthstone the animations are good and the system is interesting however the card game is ridiculously oppressive for new players all the default ways to get cards give you the same basic common and a splash of rare cards even the basic beginner decks cost tens of thousands of dust to craft if you want to sit there and grind out horrible ridiculous games against ranked opponents or bore your mind our grinding the artificial intelligence gauntlet and forge then this is your game otherwise be prepared to spend a ton of money on yet another electronic card game
early access review recommend this game however i do not have much experience with the game since i actually bought it at the time no one played so i waited now it is free and i assume more people will play and i am happy for them since this game is innovative but also quite beautiful despite this i am still disappointed that i was stupid enough to buy it
in this review i am going to list the pros and the cons of this game i know it is hard to change the minds of people who do not like the game but i will try pros of course there are eighteen different species to hunt nineteen with the incoming caribou active development team they have status updates weekly to keep you informed and even some surprises as well this week we got came face paint its the only up to date hunting sim out there last one was probably deer hunter beautiful scenery this game is powered by the same engine that just cause and just cause two runs on realism it int necessarily one hundred realistic but its the most realistic hunting game live played cons while this game is free to play to a certain extent for free you will probably have to pay at some point but a three month membership plus a shotgun revolver came cap caller and a few other things is fifteen dollars for three months that a hell of a lot cheaper than elder scrolls online which has you pay sixty dollars outright and then fifteen dollars a month for three months one hundred and five us expensive this game can get expensive but if you re a minimalist unlike me you can get a six month membership for thirty two dollars and that includes license for all species access to all reserves unlimited basic ammo as well as a forty four revolver twelve a pump action shotgun you can shoot anything with it three hundred and fifty seven revolver compound bow snakebite that four weapons along with those you get camping supplies which is used to travel to campsites or tents hmm rifle scope wind indicator hmm handgun scope boone crockett cap basic pants backpack which doubles your inventory space turkey box caller basic jacket and a tent which you can use to set up a alternate spawn in point most missions at some point require you to buy a specific weapon which is kinda bogus but of well other than that i have no complaints about this game the game is beautiful addicting and fun as hell live been playing for three months and i will definitely get a membership extension you pay fifteen bucks for three months to hunt everything and if you get tired of it you done have to keep paying you pay sixty bucks for call of duty you get bored of it you take it to games top and sell it for a couple bucks expansive worlds has to make money and this game is aimed toward a very small group of gamers this is their namesake so they have to be able to live somehow free to play is a bit iffy and if they put a disclaimer saying that not everything is free from the start people wouldn't jump in expecting it and then getting old its a great game fifteen bucks for three month membership plus a couple guns and other stuff thirty two for four weapons plus a ton of other its aimed toward a small group of gamers they have to make money somehow so is one hundred and five bucks for three months compare
let me tell a guys the truth of do aim one of the old data players since data all star has made and start playing data two since twenty thirteen and have two thousand eight hundred hour plying this game data is real amazing at first even after ten year it will still be amazing butt tit some thing urine your game paly and makes a change your mind cant play only for fun or a will be lose most of time this game needs many years to be pro with it and need a lot of practice this game rely on team play and the bad thing is a gonna play with random players and ninety a will have at least one cancer or better say real noon teammate that urine your game even if a play pro your noon teammate destroy everything data with take almost all of your real time if a wanna ply good and make a addicted more than drug trust me it all pro players almost destroy there education job habits and for data its the truth but this is not a normal players in talking about data real fan the toxic community is another thing that makes it worst trash talks every game rely bad community even a noon urine the game and start yelling everyone and report a for nothing and after many game a get ban it i remember one i had twenty recent game that i had most kill and net worth but i got eleven report laugh out loud a after playing ten year of playing data and details done enter this game or a lose your brain health sport your real life i promise just ask every pro lifestyle data food sleep data food sleep data is like a black hole once a enter it a cant get out like a bad drug i suggest play this game as a fun one or two hour hobby and enjoy your life or spent your most time of it and be as us that we lost most of our life because of douai wish data never created i never forget ice frog
early access review remember being excited about this game when the first electroplated were released but now now with them removing role play and go means that the loot system is now extremely poor and some people who had galaxy cash lost money and had it converted to virtual currency in an online store only problem is the conversion rate seems to be unfair in how much it gives also with how limited the cup seems to be in usually unable to actually build what i want to build this is one of the reasons i enjoyed having a megabit so much so basically the game was good but now the deus seem more concerned about getting people to buy premium than making the game enjoyable i do think its worth trying but only if you can handle having it take ages to build anything you want and if you done like being taunted by the visible premium only items at the end of every game
do not believe all the negative reviews this is a great hunting games is it totally free to play a yes no this game has enough to play for free if a you are just a casual hunter playing now and again a you done mind only hunting five types of animals whitetail deer cottontail european rabbits snowshoe hare pheasant a you play to earn pm in game money by doing missions then spend that on other game licenses a do i have to spend a lot of real money to play a no not at all if you want to hunt all the animals you can get a subscription that only cost three hundred and thirty three a month less if you get a longer sub if you want to own a lot of weapons clothing hunting dog it center to customise your character you'll have to spend some real money to get pm the in game money that you buy with real money but how much is up to you if you buy one of the downloadable content those are the subscriptions three six twelve month with bonus items they cost slightly more then normal subscriptions but you only by those once for the bonus items then re sub at normal rate the bonus items are worth the extra as it will save you money over buying them separately as a free player you can hunt the five animals i mentioned above you can track and spot any animal in the game you start with two free weapons two hundred and forty three bolt action rifle and the single shot shotgun you can hunt on anywhere on the map some areas will have nothing to shoot for free players you can hunt with you friends in multiplayer no you can not shoot your friends no matter how much you would like to can you walk for long periods of time and not spot anything a yes just like in real life you can hunt for long periods without spotting anything you'll find lots of tracks to follow also you will want to walk not run this int cod take your time walk crouched listen for movement around you just like you would have to do if you where really hunting if you like hunting games give it a try its got a great community nice graphics good hunting and its somewhat free
use to be a great game not any more people tank shots too much head spam too much game crashes a lot they should change the name of the game to new frustration stories done take any notice of my playtime have a ton of hours in this game before it went to steam you can still play via game launcher and that why it looks like i done have much in game time
id rather play war thunder thanks at least you can fly the damn planes to be fair i haven played it at all hardly but the first impression counts and i want impressed get war thunder instead and enjoy the game if you brought all the docs it would set you back one thousand two hundred and fifty odd really naff overpriced do better games out there avoid like the plaque after reviewing deus response which is fair comment i suppose i know its not war thunder i get that i suppose it was a lame comparison but i like fluid game play and to be honest i struggled a lot but as they said its a study sim which is very in depth both graphically and usability i am not a defeatist but i have given up on some games out there because well they are too involved i just want to launch a game and play and enjoy it after all its just a game its not going to get me a pilots licence it center the graphics were good but load times were slow and go is a large file so i guess i was disappointed after waiting so long for it to download load in the old days i used to play of which nowadays would look crap so technology and engines have come a long way but the fluidity was there if i could have done i would have given this game a mixed recommendation and not a negative one but felt it did not deserve a yes vote still i cant get over the downloadable content costs sorry but i know things cost money but come on i can buy a lot of other games for that cost so that turned it for me too sorry but that just me in sure other people with more time and money on their hands would like it
early access review this game used to be amazing it was perfect i stopped playing it for a while and recently came back to it and i have to say they completely freaking ruined it i swear they took every single good part out of the game and now it is completely pay to win great job idiots you ruined a perfectly normal game
early access review if you like tag this is a great game if you like games with real action then you will probably give up on this after the first two hours of playing like i did still a good game tough
this is a a a a king awesome game its a little cute and bouncy looking with its simplistic two dimensional graphics but it can get slightly dark at times but not to dark a duff to rate it teen or mature yet it dost feel watered down it really it a fallout game not a cheap cash grab and it is addictive as hell it has some pay to win stuff in it but not in a bad way so i do recommend it cause which its free so why not give it a try
early access review nice concept but what i often miss at those giant spaceship game is to have a feeling for that scale and the meaning of it a fast game play where a single person controls a whole ship with quick kills kind of disappoints me id like to see something similar where single players control smaller ship classes and the big ships are like team guild bases where player can dock and can take different positions on board of the main ship
early access review all the game wants is money they done care about anything else now its in hard to get money and you have to spend money to have fun this game used to be good with the back when the deus could give a done get this game
possibly the best idle clicker live ever played cookie clicker meets war craft ii so many factions so much to unlock seamless transition between mobile and personal computer via congregate account i have many hours on mobile before i tried the personal computer version you can spend money to get some sort of in game currency but i still haven figured out why you would want to do that
room is a free bullet hell style massively multiplayer online role playing game unlike many morphs the pacing is fine nice and fast it also features perm death with rogue lite elements unlocking new classes and other such things each time you die i personally done mind the art style though i know pixel art is not for everyone all in all i find the game play loop thoroughly enjoyable and i would recommend playing this with friends which is easy because its free for a deep fun experience
if you got a friend go for it should only take up a few hours if you re bored if you want to try more classes make separate accounts although crafting new classes int hard you just need to get a special item from a certain uncommon loot box resources you pick up are shared with everyone else nearby so there no fighting over loot the progression kind of hits a massive bump in the road at about level one thousand and twelve found myself searching endlessly and never receiving much needed upgrades to progress to the next zone levelling up had to do it and once upon reaching the new zone worse loot than previous was dropping completely halting my progression the progression is what kept me into it for the few hours but its just dead now why is la zone dropping level eight loot where la worlds dropped la loot at the start enemies die pretty quickly as usual and you re pretty much invincible a little ways in you might have some risk of death but otherwise enemies just take a bit longer to kill then you'll be at the point where every enemy is just a pure damage sponge that kills you in thirteen hits and its just ridiculous quite a bit of the game is locked behind premium currency of which is quite expensive and some of it behind a massive grind that would make war frame jealous spending money gets you massive boosts that people yell pay to win over the game does a poor job of explaining things you get these tutorial quests that are pretty easy to do then it wants you to craft things using materials it never thought you to harvest so i had to check the wiki on how to progress most of it was go here do this complete dungeons on the map then move to next map and that actually all the game is doing random worthless dungeons for the slimmest chance that something decent might pop out the server lag is among some of the worst live seen say you jump and glide but then you teleport to the ground because the server didst register your inputs there countless rubber banding here and there which massively interferes with combat causing hits to not register even stuff you can collect sometimes doesn't work you'll miss maybe one overall because while it looks like you collected it you didst its invisible and once you leave and reload the area you can now see all the plants and stuff you missed that apparently didst register you and the server often see two completely different things before they try to sync up in the most horrible way possible there also a challenge you can take part of at the top of every hour but its so poorly programmed that if you get in there just before the timer runs out you re just wasting your time you cant get the reward even if you ace the challenge despite being eligible to enter at the time you are no longer eligible for the rewards because you cannot reenter the challenge it be like giving a twenty five minute race on a twenty minute timer they may complete the race but you wont give them the rewards essentially the more i play the more i see horribly wrong with it with nothing good to say may
this is the best massively multiplayer online role playing game ever made and no thanks to green lighting a viable on steam this game has easy handling a good story and never gets boring must have for every sides roller anime beat pm up lover
you really need to prepare yourself to play this game you need to be ready for people to belittle you for making small mistakes and expect everyone to have little no regard for a good team composition expect everyone else to actively seek to assist the enemy team in any way possible that way when you encounter decent people you are pleasantly surprised people get tilted super fast and it can be terrible when idiots come in packs now that it is summer break it is going to be harder to play and stay positive with the younger crowd having the witch hunt mob mentality with reporting people so if you want to enjoy your time playing pay little attention to chat unless someone is actually attempting to offer constructive criticism done take it personally when people talk trash unless its constructive please remember if you a rent part of the solution to toxicity then you are part of the problem
started game spawned near nothing found air lane kicked zombies by punches in face found a bat and a gun with ten bullets suddenly its night and emma attacked by three or four zombies in the middle of other zombies with no more bullets in my gun pressing three to take my bat and smash some zombie heads but nothing my guy is really scared i guess not willing to change the weapon and stick with the gun with no bullets dead for ten minutes character actually cant get in the game for ten minutes a must create another survivor but ill use that time for dis install
updated june thirty two thousand and seventeen if you are or were a fan of blizzards hearthstone but despise blizzard then this is your light at the end of the tunnel a masterpiece card game that raises the bar for the genre to yet unsurpassed levels of excellence truly an ultimate achievement from the guys who brought us the elder scrolls all of the lore is in this game the racial elements and all of the awesome sauce from the rugs making it a great experience to play addicting as hell so beware once you start playing done expect to be able to walk away if you have a background in mtg or hearthstone then this will be simple for you to get going and to be able to compete in a short amount of time heroes of sky rim has been introduced and it is pretty impressive the only bad thing is that this didst increase the player base of the game it still hovers between kkt or lower depending on off peak times the reasons for this problem are up to the developer to fix hopefully they will find a way to resolve things and get this game to a pinnacle of glory where it so deserves to be June
early access review this game is just amazing the smooth quality and game play of it is just amazing especially if it is in alpha however when matchmaking is finally fixed the networking for the game went completely downhill but overall amazing game kinda reminds me of world of tanks though
i have almost three hundred hours into this game its not something you want to take seriously if you do then you will become very frustrated and spend multiple hundreds of dollars on i know because live spent over five hundred on upgrades across multiple countries with russia not being our closest allie i stayed away from them i was born and raised in the us a so i went for my country and their allies i didst realize or know that this game is for the russians if you choose a faction make it the russians they are by far and wide more powerful than anything the kill the most powerful tanks of any other country with one shot even if its multiple levels lower done waste your money or time in finding all the free to play games are jacked up i will stay away from them there will be a shift away from them and they will learn and go bankrupt maharaja
welcome to duel links nothing has changed from the mobile version including packs that only contain three cards which at their exchange rate makes this more expensive than playing the real game no trading in a trading card game ungodly grinding designed specifically to make you spend tons of money overly long cut scenes that waste your time decking your way to victory
i wish i could recommend this but this game is just straight up you need cash to git god type of game you can give it a shot but eventually you will feel very under power and force to cash to just catch up player versus player is cancer wouldn't enter it if you want to lose
i think this is a good game recently they changed the main map to make it smaller and more fast paced i cant compare it to how it was before because i began to play this game after the change but looking at the change logs at least it looks like the deus are listening to the community the good i really like how the combat feels in this game every ship feels different and has a different play styles free to play but not pay to win skill still is what matters in the end of the day its not the worst free to play system live seen but its still free to play you can take a lot of time to unlock ships and crew or buy it with real cash i done think the prices are abusive though the latest released ship costs about eight and the old ones you can get for around one but i would still prefer to pay a one time price and get everything frequent update the bad matchmaking is not perfect you get a lot of people with very different skills but at least it does try to even the teams a bit the recent change in the map made people mad i kinda wish to know how it was before the change maybe the deus will change it to be a bit more like it used too there are only two macarena game modes available coming from a mob like heroes of the storm i feel the lack of more maps with different objectives strategies to spice up the game overall i would recommend this game
great game allows various types of builds for the same class the passive skill tree allows each char to be what the user wants it to be the new downloadable content betrayal is sick it makes every map interesting looking for things to kill and for items to get it gets kinda grind and grind but its worth it for endgame and the best of all its free
when i first purchased this game i was thinking this was going to be some kind of memory game and well it is but its so much more first off this is a memory game but not just any memory game its a game about disassembling reassembling and even remembering how each gun is taken apart and put back together with without using the guides this game is really about remembering the order in which you have to assemble the parts there also a shooting range for each gun so you get an idea on how to use the gun as well as teaches you how to spare your ammo for each target and on how you can learn to use each gun on aiming handle and even practice on moving targets one thing to note about this game is that although it is called world of guns its not just about guns there also sections of the game that lets you disassemble and reassemble skeletons army vehicles tank humvee sports cars and even a harley during the course of playing the game you also get some really neat info about each weapon vehicle and skeleton details about the make model history concept and what went into making each weapon what i like most about this game is how well detailed the designer put into making each part of every weapon someone did some serious homework on this game based on how many parts each gun has i found this game not only fun but also informative and even help me to learn to respect weapons learning how the mechanics and insides work was the best part about his game i have read some other reviews and they seem to claim that some parts of the game were too hard although i can somewhat understand this is more of a memory game as each gun vehicle skeleton as an order in which its assembled so you have to remember the order of the parts in order to get a good score this is a memory game not so much a shooter game some guns have as much as one hundred parts to remember while a few guns only have say two thousand and thirty parts every part has its place every part must also be done in a certain order so you got to use your head more than use your speed once you know how the parts go speed will follow this is is a trial and error game as well as memory game if you like memory games this is a good game to get warning although this game is free you can purchase download content which opens up all the areas of the game or you can purchase experience points as well as credits to open up only a few select areas you only start out with one gun at the beginning and must earn experience and credits to open up other areas of the game you earn experience and credits when you complete tasks on each gun
early access review this game confuses me because it int badly done its a free to play game but its mostly paranoid grind there are some pay to win elements to it but live not noticed them have any significant impact on the game you gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly i was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing the interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun int actually bad in fact its pretty good you re essentially a metal box of anti infantry that can park in any barn you want it works well and you done feel crapped on from above just because you re not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash the weapons are heavily custom sable and they actually make a difference i have an sub machine gun that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it wonderful thing since in such a crap shot you can also steal bicycles and give people back is which is clearly a major selling point the game itself is very basic there not much to it its a world war two shooter which feels to me like day of defeat on battlefield sized maps but its nothing special just a shooter but it has me hooked live no idea why the game is average but the fact that its a free to play game that doesn't feel like in forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point i could use a bigger tank sure you gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks but i done want to because everything in this game from basic gear to bigger gear has its place in still confused as to exactly what it is about this game i like maybe its just simply because its hitting all the right notes for a free to play game that wants to include a pay to win element but doesn't feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it maybe its because the game is bare bones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way or maybe its just because i can steal some americans bicycle for the glorious fatherland
early access review know the game is are alpha i understand that balancing and lack of options in the game settings will be fixed but at the moment its more unplayable than totally accurate battlegrounds was on release date and at those days the game was crashing every five minutes but this game users all you get stuck constantly in invisible walls the zone is changing and coming faster than ever and since you cant determine your own spawn location you most likely spend about the if the game running through fields naked the weapon balance is so de up you get one shot by an sub machine gun but a but naked enemy needs at least two hits from a bolt action sniper rifle to die not to mention that the spawn rate of weapons is ridiculously low there were times when you loot a whole village previously unvisited by any other player and you are still lucky to find a pistol with a magazine or two and the drop rate of any kind of loot is unchanged even in squads so you have a good chance at finishing the game with two of your group members still not having a weapon the developers really have to get themselves together to do anything because atm its comedic effects and originality are far overshadowed by tag
if you are looking for a good sandbox game done play this the developers decided it would be a good idea to do loot crates like crosscut just a few weeks after crosscut came out along with the new update it is now a pay to win one be caus you get double the items if you pay a stupid amount money you also cant paint your bot without paying because the color you gat are light blue gray orange or white if you done believe me play one round and when you say this game is done say i didst warn you edit now they have just implemented a battle royal mode and docs over one hundred so if you want to have fun play literary any other game the game used of be good and its just bad now you'll find a lot of long time players quit playing because it was a free to play game now it a payt play
done waste your time this is one of those free to play games where if you any anything other than the basics you re going to have to shell out some actual money heres an in game currency system but its pointless because all you can spend it on is ammo and permits if you want anything other than a rifle and scope you'll have to pay real money
early access review at first i was excited for this game character creator is amazing combat seemed fun and dynamic enough in the training area but that where the good ends optimized micro transaction heavy cash shop money for dungeon teleportation really infinite bugs that deus seem keen to ignore unreleased content that is released in other regions done buy this game i hope i can still refund it maybe ill come back later when they decide that their player base matters more but this game for now laugh out loud
early access review great game for now it needs a lot of care to become a good one compared to the other games same type and bow guys the crosshair is for reals non keep it up great work cool game
early access review excellent space combat game its what i would imagine space warfare would look like in the next two hundred years if we done kill ourselves worth the price just in alpha
if you want the experience play on a valve pub at first not other ones as they may have mods like a besides that though done go complaining about engineer relying too much on his buildings its what he was meant to do of and done complain about other classes then yours being overpowered half the time since they are more likely a higher skilled player than you that just my opinion May
early access review its is a real good game but you should remove the grenades and or nerf them because a can manage to get three per player a game and up to fifteen a team and every grenade deals to many damage they can all one tap you
early access review this game is ray cool and entertaining for plebs like me who cant afford to buy pub its still in early access needs a little bit of fix in some details but overall its an awesome game to play a friends
its a very nice basketball game that confuses me with its controls and annoys me with its voice acting live only played a few games with one of my friends and both of us after that were saying nothing but come on linker pass the ball seriously it drove me insane after that i never touched the game ever again not because in not into basketball but because the menu is difficult to navigate and all the little extras that they have is confusing and something i just done see myself wasting my time on this is one of those times where i wish steam would add a meh in between or average button instead of just a recommend or done recommend
i really wish i could have actually played this game even with its payt play aspects my biggest problem is that i have made three accounts over the past few weeks and i still have yet of get in the servers the only reason i have a few hours recorded is because i spent a lot of time with the login window up while it tried to trouble shoot this is just a heads up to all those who are hesitant but at this point this game int even worth the time
turns out plus is a pretty big negative why not just bring back battle cup at week and leave it at that adding extra features to entice people to play more defense of the ancients two data was always better then other mobs because everything was unlocked at the start and there was no pay to win good game volvo good game
you know after having set three thousand hours since march of last year and spending so much time in the game i saw the appeal that many players do it was truly a great game in more ways than i can count i know its legacy will live strong nine hundred and eleven poor execution March
early access reviewing put a lot of time into this game and given them a fair share of money but this company is headed down the wrong path i could write a long and lengthy review where i go over every step of the games development but you know what heres a synopsis this game is fun at its current state though you will have to grind for hundreds of hours to get where you want to be or you can spend fifty dollars the choice is yours
early access review guess after they failed the game twice it was about time to milk the west i wish that the core an deus realise that we are not going to eat this anymore and we are not the rich relatives across the ocean who put one hundred bucks in your pockets while you cant even wash your sockets the game is terrible at many aspects it has an outdated engine stupid combat system totally unattractive story and lore instances and the claustrophobic feeling that you are walking on a small map even if the world is huge is just on paper is actually composed of many small places tied together buy it at your own risk but i am writing this as a statement for you all stop supporting the asian developers is time they learn to threat the western market with respect and deliver good and finished products at the prices that they would normally practice in their countries respect the buyer or sell your to the russians
early access review it pains me dearly to thumb down this once great game i haunt played it in well over a year since the guys i used to play it with haven been on much this was one of my favourite free to play games back in the day but after giving it a quick play earlier today i had a rude awakening they completely on the mechanics that had originally made the game popular it went from an ingenious invention based fast paced combat game to a piece of pay to win flat game that belongs to that graded out group of games you've uninstalled i could explain all the issues that lead this game to its sad current state or i could just link you this tips robert game that explains it perfectly
early access review for a beta i think its very good some things like the gold exp drop could be improved and usable items could be dropped instead of just crafting materials my main complaint is that the summon friend function doesn't work you either face an endless connecting to server screen or appear in the world with a semi opaque joining friends server box in the middle of your screen unable to attack but vulnerable to enemies and your friend is nowhere to be seen
early access review space based mob beautiful graphics so far and its tons of fun to play its still early access so there issues and bugs but the deus are always on top of it constantly paying close attention to their forums and investigating the issue as soon as they can
if you re into shooter games and you want to know how some of the guns you use there work this is the perfect game for you also if you like puzzle games i recommend playing this because this game is basically puzzling just with weapon parts the different game modes and achievements make it challenging for example disassembling and reassembling a gun in a certain amount of time or not making mistakes in choosing the right part at the right time
i got this on steam when it was still a baby it has now grown into a giant you can tweak this game to your hearts desire what a brilliant simulator it has become i always favored factor but i must say race room has now taken the lead this really is the best racing sim you can buy project cars feels like a console game and a like a boat simulator keep up the good work sector three
the game is a good game if you like running around for a little looking for things and getting killed a lot by zombie things bad server disconnections are often zombies will spawn out of the blue sometimes really easy to find armour and guns low food in areas boring after ten to fifteen min last finding people is really hard unless you get in a game with at least one hundred or fifty people hats my opinion about the game overall but their were good things about needs some improvement in the updates of the game that my opinion about this video game
i play the game and have really really big fun to bad the game kick me because i use hack for real i was playing normal and boom all of my time on the game is now gone i ask why my acc is perm abated and they didst tell me so i make a new steam acc so i can start again playing it and after some time i got perm abated again so done play it because at one point you will lose all cool weapons and your time
has got to be one of the games with the worst matchmaking live seen in a while you tell me every twenty five games that i have a great behaviour score and almost every match you match me up with people who tilt abandon the game flame everybody what the is going on this is a game nobody should play all it does it anger people
early access review the most hilarious inebriated fun i have had in a long time grab some friends fire up team speak or sit next to them drink alcohol and have an amazing time
early access review how can you allow a game to be downloaded from this site that installs software that cannot be removed using the uninstall remove programs tool roaches to remove tips wow youtube co watch vpqkfqymkhttps wow youtube co watch video more
the deus clearly done give a damn about this game they've made nothing but improvements to the skin while constant bugs reduce the quality of the game this game is just a skin simulator its a shame because it has so much potential
early access review kill someone noon get killed by someone alabama yamaha owned kill someone with grenade you fun luck get killed by someone from a grenade low follow you are a noon get killed by a team made get out of the way you fun dot accidental kills a teammate watch it you fun idiot drives a car wait for me you not headset someone you fun hacker get he showed by someone alabama yamaha owned you not your team win all the enemy team rage your enemy team win all your teammates rage internet prob game crashes for one day otherwise i like this game one thousand and ten rage simulator twenty fourteen
lets start with the basics okay so the game is similar to the very popular game called league of legends well but since i done really like i mean i hate league of legends i didst really plan to play with this game either because i heard that its very similar to that game and you know since i done like that game why would i like this one after i played it it turned out that its much better i repeat much better than league of legends because in league of legends you get to play as like a strategy game camera position from above clicking to move it center and i done really like strategy games either but there are some that i liked a bit for example red alert but that different also this game is played in third person mode you can play with a lot of good characters but here they are called gods because actually some of them that i know are really gods that has been confirmed by people in the old ages who knows when and so yes the game is really similar to league of legends but as i said its much better the game has got a quite good graphics it has a good fighting system it has a fair money system because here there is no pay to win there is only pay to skin maybe that you can get because skins are the things for the gods that you can get by paying for the game or by collecting gems or at some skins favor that is used for the money itself in the game anyway or there could be pay to win if someone pays a lot for the game just to get all the gods its even possible to do it on low level by paying for the game there are different type of classes like in any more games you know like those common classes like warrior assassin mage it center whatever anyone says if you get to learn to use a specific class or a character then you can play well with that but it depends on you for example i cant really play with the class mage but there a mage character like as i said a specific character sometimes that i can use well so i think if you would like to get to know or to try this game i really recommend you this one anyway this game is really based on teamwork so the team has really gotta work together well to succeed otherwise if you solo if you like go alone and try to do everything on your own you will fail unfortunately sometimes there are hackers but you can report themes you can play with bots as well there a tutorial in the game you can practice it center
pros one an interesting and varied world of heroes view from a third party a variety of combat modes minuses one most of the characters have to buy only one minus and then decide if you have the opportunity to spend a little and buy a ready pack with all the gods the rest some pluses
great game ruined by the worst developers i have ever seen hire have a great game idea the third person mob is great but lower keep putting out updates that no one wants the new user interface is the latest dumb idea they basically copy and pasted the console user interface and stuck it on personal computer with zero optimisation it is ugly and confusing to use it also has much less features then the original user interface which everyone liked their skin releases a just stingy almost all their skins a only unlock able from chests with one in fifty chance of getting what a want hire done listen to their player base at all if they did this could be an amazing game as the game play and mechanics a all there this game is like vomit that tastes nice looks and is unappetizing but is good if a can overlook the many flaws
early access review its not bad it feels like a very basic shooter in the vein of modern warfare no real pay town elements however hit detection seems a bit off at least when i played and the is just frankly too high if you want this game download iron sight instead miles better
early access review honestly the last date completely ruined the game right before it it was a pretty good game in obj not a hardcore vet of this game but i liked to play it casually but it seems like now i get into lobbies where the creations almost seem godlike while mine still have the original cannons it may just be me but i cant stand this game anymore May
a quality free to play action role playing game it has a skill system similar to final fantasy vii material system where you put a skill gem in a piece of equipment to gain access to new abilities or passive bonuses that can link to other skill gems in the same piece of equipment that has linked slots as well as getting one passive skill point per level up to spend in a skill tree reminiscent of final fantasy is system minus killing enemies for a you get to play through a well made campaign with several acts without paying a dime if you re a fan of games like diabolo ii torchlight it center you should definitely give this game a try sometime
takes the arg genre pioneered by blizzard with their diabolo series and improves on it if you loved diabolo ii and were disappointed by the relative simplicity of diabolo iii path of exile offers endless opportunity to theory craft diverse characters
early access review in going to give a complete bare bones review pros space shooter looks greatest retreat mechanics not icons cannot talk in game most of the community does not work as a team new grinding some ships are a little a wait times for a match three minutes that insane all in all seven hundred and ten really hope they improve on some things but good game
early access review as of currently i can not say i like what i see even for a beta this game is quite broken though game play is the only one that int broken to my knowledge but its the loading the buffering the waiting its too long i mean i expected this to be basically planet side but in a wii era instead i get a battlefield free to play though in not arguing on that subject i actually done mind in the slightest but the fact that i had to wait nearly fifteen minutes just to get to the main menu and an additional five minutes to get into a game i rather just update planet side two and play that and after the game was done i got to the point where i could unlock buy weapons and that broken too every time i buy a weapon it doesn't respond i keep clicking and i never unlock the weapon again i can reason it being a beta i should expect some issues but this has been out since july and its nearing the end of august i think there should of been plenty of time for this to not be an issue for future players like me i want to enjoy this game but with the waiting and the no response of the menu i cant exactly say in impressed nor makes me want to come back whats the point in waiting nearly half an hour to play one game when there are other games like it that are not only polished but finished to where it can take me just mere seconds to play a game maybe when its officially released i may come back to see if its been improved but after tonight in more likely not coming back July
product received for free early access reviewers are living in their own little world and refuse to listen to the community last update was the worst thing ever for any person who has played the game before it they removed all progression systems most strategic robot building and guaranteed currency in all free am is ruining their game
pay to win simple as that if you like spending loads of cash into games then this game will be loads of fun otherwise you will have a really hard time in player versus player its extremely unbalanced also not just from damage from pay to win players but with characters cheering their way doing one combo kills and unable to mana break or extremely overpowered skills one shooting players will argument its not pay to win because you can get stuff without purchasing you can doesn't change the fact that it will be near impossible for a new player without spending cash to keep up with veteran pay to win players just watch videos from jan hae won in youtube excellent player and watch his video of why he stopped playing els word
as a huge fan of the elder scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me its really personal preference whether you play this magic or hearthstone it center but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double landing system in est the story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and they re many different ways to test out new decks created is artificial intelligence or actual players there is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too and also there is a nice addition of solo arena which pits you verging tough artificial intelligence characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose three times each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards the deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation overall this would be my favourite card game in its current genre eight hundred and ten
early access review this game is like magic the gathering if you could just get all the cards by grinding therefore its a one hundred billion times better than magic this is the way to waste every single one of your waking hours and if you need to quit your job in order to play more you wont even fall behind in the meta for the inability to buy more cards you just keep grinding good game but i wish ranked mode gave better payouts than the artificial intelligence mode
early access review half lego half team deathwatch driving flying combat well executed good use of the premium model pay for faster access to new toys but its not pay to win got a lot of enjoyment out of just building lots of different weird robots it can get a bit grind once you hit the higher levels but i figure that just trying to incentivise people to pay
early access review game has been somewhat fun but the mana flood problems make you feel like one out of every five games is just down to pure luck and some games are just no playable due to a huge ring due to deck size is too large seventy five cards the mandatory twenty five power cards wild card swing the mulligans are stupid crazy your first hand can be one power automatic mulligan into two power cards followed by the next five cards of no power cards thus automatic loss maybe if they fixed the power cards mulligan it would feel like more strategy but a lot of my wins losses are just feeling like one person got mana screwed while the other did not so rare to have a good close game its just silly to think its strategy at this point
early access review glanced through the negative comments about this game and boy that was entertaining the read whining of people who didst understand a thing about this game i wont spend my time explaining why this is a good card game if you like mtg mechanics and want to see them implemented in a is like user interface this is the game for you if you are used to hearthstone super simplistic resource method this game is not for you if you are an old dog like me who still enjoy card games with separated resource cards included in the deck which by the way there are tons of ways to use the amount of extra mana you have for your advantage this is your game
after all these years do you guys really think you can keep getting away with treating your players like sheep coming from someone with unfortunately hundreds of dollars into this game having played since twenty thirteen and being a tanka plane nut you cannot present your game as one which requires players to pay money to grind the rank fifty six grind is so unbearable at times that people will just quit the game instead of sticking around why do they quit because its ridiculous trying to grind a stock vehicle and putting up with the repair costs after you get walked over because its stock that not a fun grinding challenge that being slapped in the face foreigner fix your a a a a
alright kids listen up cause heres a life lesson this game is dangerous you'll start out fine but then your life will perpetuate into a spiral of doom you will be called some of the most horrid things ever typed by a human being in every language there is and all for picking some purple horned bastard you will rage innumerable times and get sent to valves version of hell low priority here everything is worse more russians worse players more profanity and its all your fault for some reason you'll quit play again quit again play again buy one thousand of cosmetic items cry laugh its almost as if this is valves version of a shakespearean play from the pits of hell that game dragged up personal for us its shown as free to play but its not by any means this game will steal your soul and laugh at you while it does so and the best part is you'll love every minuet of your life hat you burn on this game get it now be for it gets you
if you want a game that listens and is fair to the player base or gives competitive game play done bother with war thunder every now and then they'll nerf progression and implement stuff that you can buy for golden eagles and the player base doesn't want you see that in the forums rather than to fix year old bugs the russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly this most experienced in the mode realistic battle where its nation is nation and the russian nation has a win rate over eighty at ranks two and three over ninety the ring for russian tanks artificial intelligence just a joke because they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with one shot because off overpowered ammo some world war two tanks have post war ammo you really done have anything else to play than random battles if you re not in a clan and the my is one of the worst live ever seen it doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types so you get into matches planes where twelve of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters that an auto loose grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless because there is nothing to do with them they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the queen for a very long time because very few players play them done get me wrong the game was good at patch one hundred and thirty five more than a year ago maybe two but after that it just got worse a lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates one hundred and thirty seven and one hundred and forty three where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message
its like angry birds but without the birds and you have cards instead that you can pay for its like doodle jump except there is no ledges to jump on so you just end up killing yourself every time you play addicting though would my friend in a duel again
i am no stranger to mos having played world of war craft since vanilla as well as playing wild star and star citizen but when i did finally try never winter i was blown away the small guys have come out with one huge great game and i am a daily player now and absolutely love it they did a heck of a job on it considering a lot of the competition out there has a lot more money and power to put into their games but this is every bit as good and i will play it for a long time to come if you are thinking of trying it then do so you will not be disappointed one bit and will be hooked instantly as i was an easy nine thousand five hundred and ten
beef spooky house of jump scares is probably one of my favourite horror games there a ton of references to other horror games someone who easily spooked and my friends have most certainly enjoyed hearing my screams in panic when the cutest little squid pops up in my screen i have also enjoyed the screams of a bunch of my friends in the same way i recommend anyone to make a friend play this while at their house or screen sharing during a call some of the enemies are actually more challenging than i had thought and it took quite a while till i beat the final boss i must say in not really a pro gamer though and its completely free
live only played this game for a amount of time on steam but live been playing it for quite some time now through glyph every single second live spend in this game has been awesome wether it was some simple fishing or killing dangerous monsters everything has and still is amazing if you re new to the game however feel free to use my referral code ttcyqpznnhrnpnnfwd
early access review after one hundred hours in heres my review quick and to the point wont repeat majority of what others stated less one fort five same grind you have always done in every game end game buy lvi thirty even gear off a seven some of it add some spirits run highest level dungeon in game bosses have eighty chance to drop no loot at all dungeon lockout of twice a day spend one months farming level fort five gear to then wait on raid content update week one duplication exploit ruined economy week two child exploit re ruined economy week three if you did not take advantage during week one two have fun grinding money for no real reason player versus player rewards nothing currently player versus player goes from broken to patched and break something else each week week one mages press two for free wins week two if your a paladin you can one a four people multiple skills on each class do not work paladins cleanse literally does nothing so you are forced to just watch dots tick on you multiple mage cd abilities do not actually cd taming gets extremely grind and repetitive for little to no satisfaction of rewards marketplace a is terrible if you list a super rare item your capped on how much you can sell it for if you sell a super abundant item you must sell it for sightly more then the current going price placing your item behind literal thousands of copies so it will take days or weeks to sell in a nutshell game was worth thirty for one hundred hours if all japan server content was live in this version i could look past the bugs annoyances server lag it center it center it center but its just not game has no end game content currently no road map of when it will come and not enough activities with rewards to warren waiting months for new content
gotta say they ruined this game with their bias towards the user planes a rent balanced that terribly but ground forces is just pathetic you have world war two german vehicles trying and i mean trying to fight postwar vehicles let alone prototypes that never saw combat and were basically put there to balance out the fact that the pm was a monster of a gun live puts into a to side weak points to front hull which it should penetrate least if they were using the correct values and not the sixty deg not ones and various other instances of they done get me wrong tanks are a blast just done commit to germany because they constantly get nerved and higher tiers is all but impossible done even buy the maps as you'll just face atom and aphids rounds that make anything but spaced armour useless all in all this russian development company has an obvious hatred for the tanks that ruined their forces for a while
early access reviewing disappointed after defending the game for so long they finally release it with the same optimisation they said it would be better translation from google translate maybe even worse and with all endgame content missing this was advertised in their steam page stay away from eastern morphs
early access review love this game i enjoy the controller support be and my cousin played it till two in the morning one day night the next day there is too much stuff you have to buy i think you should be able to unlock some themed weapon skins or something great game thought
played seven hours today and all is fine and so on but in the story you suddenly reach a point where the enemy has much better cards than you doesn't seem fair or legit because i done think it has much to do with the tactics i just get the feels that in forced to buy some cards decks wit real money and that not really cheap seems like a pay to win strategies so long for this game it was nice till that point never the less and its free
one hundred and three brought me back and reminded me of all the reasons i left in the first place i done like the ground combat hell the only that kept me going was the promise of air combat and i didst even get that far the cost for some of these units is just too much being able to rate your battles is a nice feature bow not worth my time
the laura games are pretty nice vans but this one is just a clicker copy and a bad one i had to actually play it for five minutes to review it i just want to warn people its a waste time and it kinda sucks many weeks will rate any anime game with a one thousand and ten back then on steam an anime game was a rarity so any anime game was like a gem to be able to play it on steam and get backgrounds for it there want much out there but i think we reached that point where there enough already in short the game is very boring played it for two minutes and couldn't review it so i left it idle for another three minutes just to give it a bad score
if you like the feeling of clicking and not mapping to censored yentai then this is a game for you cutting edge graphics derivative story progression and next gen mechanics laura clicker is ign one thousand and ten not real yentai do not get me started on the all star voice acting
early access review this game is well worthy of your support not only are the developers offering a fantastic deal and price cut on four packs to entice a healthy game population for testing but the game is actually playable enough to be a really good hour block of enjoyment at a time this game is perfect for those times when you need to kill an hour and done wanna get into anything go buy this game its cheap its fun
whenever i decide to go back to path of exile i remember the good old days when i didst have any income whatsoever but was just so excited by the thought of playing those few games i could path of exile was one of those games if my memory serves me correctly i have upwards of two hundred hours logged in this arg each update added a new layer to the complexity of the game for a new player the complexity was something that initially pushed me away just take a moment to look up path of exile passive tree and you will get a good idea of what i mean it is or was easy to make a character that had such poorly allocated stats that it was very difficult to progress perhaps that is or was a part of its charm you have to figure out what skill gems equipment support gems passive tree configurations and if you were so lucky as to get a relevant one unique items would serve you best finally claiming success in beating all of the acts for the first time brought me a feeling that i would claim rivals beating a dark souls game for the first time i have not caught up with the community but in my experience it can be quite toxic i recommend trying it out with personal friends or alone rather than a random party that being said it is absolutely viable to play on ones own and that is was i did before i figured out how to properly navigate the initially confusing user interface definitely need an open mind when trying this one out
started playing this game without realizing that its a cellphone facebook game it is very slow paced with it taking hours for your dwellers to accomplish certain things the pace wouldn't be a problem by itself but once you get past a certain level enemies get exponentially more difficult making it impossible to continue to advance without micro transactions and or some actual strategy considering that this games pace at best relegates it to the category the idea of spending more than a couple dollars or putting more than couple hours of effort into it is absurd
early access review want to recommend this game i really do but if a game been in development and failed in two separate markets dies were just the last cash grab out the door for this game such and obvious cash grab and we all fell for it though the fighting style feels so rewarding if you are in a place that int shaking like a geriatric bad first person shooter
product received for free first of all where is the sound the sound is not automatically enabled this game seriously in all the games live ever played never has the game thrown me into the game without sound could you at least tell us that we have to enable sound second the game crashes and al tabs at random which really messed up my chance of unlocking other game modes which brings me to my third point really i have to do something just to unlock the fun part the fun part the fun part of the entire game i am not even level two yet and this game already suck zero stars for this game maybe if you fixed these problems before releasing it it would be been an actually good game
great and of whats this i bought club member and i played for nineteen hours and i found out that all my data was erased and my in app purchases and i have been waiting three months for help god have mercy done buy this
early access review dunno how many cheaters there are but from what i heard with pub the games when we are forced to play with outsiders are filled with cheaters like the ones i did see jumping thirty feet in the air from the comment responses i see i assume the deus are attacking negative reviews and i assume since they can do this the super jumper had on bunny shoes that must have been a development wearing a development created item and not a lowly fodder he had amazing shots for jumping up and down thirty feet over and over if i jumped out a second story window it would damage me slightly so he must have had unlimited health yeah so region lock the game and lock the deus out the servers cd
great graphics give those a one thousand and ten even though the rendering is terrible i was about one hundred and fifty feet away from these trees i could only see until i looked through my rifle scope but the bad part pay to have fun i started with this rifle and a license only to hunt mule deer i could hunt rabbits but my gun want right for hunting those had no idea how to do anything because i got no tutorial i done know why to buy guns from what i could tell you absolutely had to use real money same for almost everything else the developers of this game will rip you off even though its actually free to play it done even bother letting it take up space on your personal computer in less you want to shell out money if you want you can buy an overpriced membership and have a title bit of fun for a few months
its a very fun game to play when there is nothing else would only recommend to play multiplayer with friends it would be a lot better if you could do more without having to spend money to get all the really good items chests it center overall i would rate this game a
update in comments this is the first flight sim live played since i built my personal computer so forgive me if i done know the pricing model for games like this so i invested in a stick and throttle since i wanted to give flight simulation a chance which was definitely worth it its truly amazing when you finally accomplish your first flight and start to get the feel for the aircraft live gotten to the point where i want to purchase a new plane that i can learn to dogfight with so with a little bit of research live learned that the a and the of are two of my the best options for beginners along with that research i find out that the developers have increased the pricing on content that has been out for several years already i understand that it must take a lot of time and effort to make these realistic models but forty for one plane pm eighty for the newest release that seems so highly priced as a newcomer i would also gladly buy the of if the price want raised fifty it seems like in almost every other genre of gaming that would be taboo being a new personal computer gamer there are a ton of games i want to play and the last thing i want to do is join a community that is about to start getting shafted by price hikes to buy the two planes pfc i want it would cost me fifty five i may just not understand the cost of making the product but that just seems ridiculous to me especially since these items a rent even close to new May
digital combat simulator world is the best sim platform on the market today and its future looks amazing if you love sims this product is for you its great to see current versions of the products back in steam
early access review simply doesn't work i refunded it poor decisions off the bat like only one server per region on launch locking one faction when it had more players than the other more downtime than up during the head start on top of all that it really doesn't deliver what it said it would the optimisation is a joke and its also translated horribly
do not confuse this game with world of tanks this game is a knockoff to find the original game you need to go to tips world tanks com both games play about the same they are player versus player they are both pay to win the original game has much better graphics both games are basically a set of maps with tank battles of fifteen player versus player fifteen unless you set up private battles are training or setting up your tank for a battle that it tank battles and pay cash for equipment the argument that you can play without paying is a lie well only if you want to preview the game but you cant realistically compete without paying cash the grind is so ridiculously slow without dumping real world cash into it you will ether give up or buy gold
it has been and still is one of the best free to play games out which gets a lot of support and added content quite frequently if you are a diabolo two fan then you will enjoy this game highly recommend you try it
early access review love love love its still just getting started but they re off to a great start a has always made outstanding games and this one is no different new content is rolling out pretty smoothly and the environment is rich and beautiful
i was so excited to play this game and really want to enjoy it it has a lot going for it problem is no one is playing it at least the matchmaking cant seem to find a single person to play with friday night you would think it could find a game nope now maybe this int an issue for people more skilled or levelled up but sadly i cant level up because i cant find a game because matchmaking cant seem to find anyone got the armada pack wish i could get a refund since i cant do anything but play against the computer solo and its no fun great game though wish i could play it with anyone
early access review great game like world of warships but in space and without the insane grind i hope the developers will market it more aggressively like partnering up with a well known franchise and releasing ships related to that franchisee a world of warships and arpeggio
i put in hours and hours into this game but end up getting de by one guy i bet every medallion on a game with out knowing i was going up on this in youtube with one thousands hours and butted me with the cheap round thirteen rush after hours of playing this game i never felt so in butted by one person ply done let this happen to you go away as fast as you can and play some counter strike global offensive of wait they made that game easy for hackers to well hack its free to play and prime is given to all users who paid for the game i also paid for skins and ended up no using them and going back to the basic ones as some of the skins are way to big and some times would block me seeing some blooms till it was to late in round thirteen rush you if you rush in round thirteen and boost
was clicking so hard that i eventually started punching the mousepad of my laptop did int realise my parents came home the only sound in the house was moans and furious banging
early access review it feels like a free to play game with all the premium players running around in low tiers with just one or two legendary weapons and wiping the whole server deus go read the veteran comments i have if you care about your game you should really try to listen to them
as all ways there is this horrible micro transactions well not so micro in this case i rather pay fifty for a complete game then paying over one hundred for all the content you want shame on you game developers
honestly the game is really cool and super fun its just the online player matching needs more level separation the rookie matching is less one hundred and twenty three it should be lvi one hundred and ten then less one thousand one hundred and twenty then twenty one up its super lame when your a low level and you get constantly matched against people who have high level characters that make every single three point shot and block everything side note the intro music gets super annoying but in all its a really fun game love the customization and character selections its really just the matchmaking that is the problem
legends are very broken hit boxes are very broken full of toxic spammer for players bra its a very bad game i done recommend think a should go and play super smash bros or street fighter or teen or mortal combat
might be a war gaming but on here pure hacks to tank running to weapon seen often many of the clans was perm banned of wot now play here like always steam games safe for them to hack
early access review this was one of my favourite games i had decided to recently re download it and found it had went the way of too many games the free to play coverup instead of getting experience from battles and then being able to transfer it into more parts you get basic parts and if you want anything else you re just straight out of luck i done recommend this game in its current state
digital combat simulator is clearly not an arcade air combat game it is a air and combat simulator so if you are having a hard time done complain pro good views are good aircraft damage is so damn cool terrain rendering is nice con only two free plane all planes need to be bought but good thing some are at avery affordable price if you like fighter jets like i do give this simulator a shot it is worth the download time
awful it makes fun for the first ten hours or so but there will be the point where you have to decide if you want to give up your entire life to learn the frames or every move character weapon and literally everything else in the game which may take up to two hundred hours or you need to accept that everyone you face in ranked will be diamond and the out of you because the matchmaking is trash i wont even recommend starting to play this game also its important to mention that skins are overpriced of May
okay so why am i not recommending this game if live already played it for well above one thousand hours you see the game is amazing the player versus player is great the map is great the mechanics are great as well the people they've entrusted to handle with the bans done even verify that the evidence given to them is indeed true which leads to people getting banned for doing nothing wrong in tired of hearing that my friends getting banned wrongfully so until you guys fix this issue this review stays negative my old review fun game to play with friends way less hackers compared to the original is my friends and i have only encountered one so far in hrs playtime up is really good since they've added player versus player map active de currently there are only two server regions which are north america and europe plus add a server for south east asia server issues and crashes
early access review over hrs played until the epic loot expansion who ever thought it was a good idea to gain robots by recycling junk out of boxes after each match for a pathetic amount of robots to put towards the parts i need or want take everyone premium currency they had and reduce whats its worth should be fired
there two kinds of people that write negative reviews on this game one people who either have bad internet connection or are unlucky enough to be located near the edge of the world far from servers players who cant accept the fact that they are being smashed by lowly spammers and they ramble on about how unfair the game is it wouldn't be if you got good there are a few reasons why i would recommend this game one of which is that you can find really amazing individuals walking around in all game modes fra has a significant lack of them but they can rarely still be seen there i feel like hit boxes in this game are really fair you will sometimes get hit by something you wouldn't expect but you could've known it has a weird hotbox and could've played around it whenever something bad happens to you you could've done something better every mistake is a learning ground and one that you created yourself and this is true also for real life have a nice life and hopefully a nice experience with this game
in gonna be honest i never intended to try this in not a huge fan of yes but i do love the series and its atmosphere i was convinced this was simply another hearthstone ripoff aimed to steal the audience i imagined it as a cheap clone because honestly that what it seemed like i couldn't be more wrong from games like mtg and pokemon where mechanics almost never change to go where a new one is introduced every other year and it forces half the players to quit because it gets worse and worse to is the ultimate soft core tag i couldn't believe how yes legends achieved so much in innovation and freshness with just a few simple but well placed mechanics it really has to be tried to be understood from the fact that it offers somewhat of a story mode with actual content and choices which reflect on your collection and individual cards to the battlefield with two lanes each offering different strategic options via modifiers or simply via controlling the two lanes so you can manipulate your opponent into reacting in a manner that suits your intents there is clearly a great amount of thought and design put into this tag and honestly as someone who always fallen for tag games this is one of the best live played and the only one that actually takes advantage of being digital in way that enhances game play its a feature that live wanted to see in a digital tag forever in conclusion if you are a yes or tag fan you definitely need to give this a spin there is always a possibility of it not being up your alley but beyond that and certain met balance complaints that are always a given in tags there is absolutely no reason for this game to be not recommended its an absolute gem
would not recommend this game in its current state arcade is unbelievable and punishes players who try and are skillful realistic simulator and squadron battles are no longer legitimate play styles because of esp hacking to which foreigner in all their glory only give temp bans to actual hackers then they ban players like myself for example for trying to stand up and say something without being vulgar or hateful no i wont recommend this game unless your an esp hacker or want to be ignored by foreigner period
fun and addictive little card game for old school anime watchers its a good memory flashback inducing ride the game has cool card entrances on boss cards can be played in player versus player and even ask experience grind when you have nothing else to do overall eight out ten points if it want so pay to win good cards are hard to obtain while free to play but not impossible its pretty bad to port from mobile to pc lost my first account to a dead phone and if it had more card entrance animation it would be ten out ten no questions asked overall check it out if you have time to spend
to make a gun simulation the graphics need to be of top quality special on the weapons them self this is if he and doom got mixed in a blender and putt in to a education in guns guns and simulation is a great combo but they lack the game graphics game heroin a get the reference you are indeed a good gamer
this is so hard to steer i done get it done get it just done its so hard to steer and done waste or money on the cars and tracks just done get it i give it a bad review creeper hunter
speak in as a person who likes the how to train your dragon series this game really sucks for real waste of time its just a cheap money maker for the people who own it not worth the time and rather disappointed that such a blatant rip off of time and money would be on steam
early access review well i am an active player of rob craft and i am really angry to see what free am has done to the game they removed megabits before i got to use them in lvi forty three the new update has made it so new players like my friend get a rocket launcher while veterans still cant get these overpowered weapons overall i done like the loot live been getting and there needs to be better match making thanks for reading
early access review for years live been looking for a game that had the complex card interactions of magic the gathering and the smooth interface of hearthstone this game combines those elements beautifully with wonderful fantasy art i recommend checking this game out this game does not disappoint
it says i only have twenty four hours on this game but in reality live been playing since february of last year war thunder is a game for very patient people the first few tanks or planes to unlock are very easy to drive by but once you get into tier forty five its the worst without a premium account you can get an average of ten million one thousand five hundred role play per game which is very small when the vehicles you re researching are around up that means it can take between a week or a month depending on how much you play to get one vehicle in tier three the farthest i have gotten is tier four germany and that is with over hrs of game play this game is really only for people who are willing to spend their lives on it there is also an option to buy golden eagles to automatically gain role play but that just a scam by itself another problem is the terrible matchmaking this game has ridiculous matchmaking you can either get down tiered very unlikely stay on your same tier could happen sometimes or get up tiered twelve bus which happens to me almost all the time its absolutely ridiculous and the deus do this to really just get you to buy more tanks with real money so its easier for you i personally have been forced to spend thirty on this game because of how painful it is to research tanks its ridiculous how the deus expect a russian tank model nineteen thirty four to pen a panther a why foreigner if you have all the time on your hands and have nothing else to do other than play games then this game could be good for you but if you have almost no time and have no money then this game is ridiculous and done bother playing it if you dedicate your lives to games and spend as much as you can on them then this game is fine in not saying this game is bad its an excellent game but what in saying is that currently this game is out of balance and a pain in the a to play i will probably take a break from this game because of how bad it is right now February
this game needs work balky controls advertising load screens had to alt to quit the game because there didst seem to be a let me get out of this game button flying was bad graphics were of but the avatars need more options didst even get to the point of choosing a dragon because of the suck est that was this game
fun game but its extremely grind and has the internet of an a game if they put the money the got from children spending their mothers credit card into good servers the game would be playable being full of bugs even though people spend hundreds of dollars on features you should be able to grind for all the time time locking someone to get stronger is pretty messed up
i haven played card games much and downloaded this one on a whim in enjoying it so far the game does a nice job teaching you how to play easing you into it in story mode if you re interested in the elder scrolls universe its worth giving a go
early access review just bad mtg clone fractions and cards are totally unbalanced everything is luck favored and there a so much random looses playing one match against a deck with just one mulligan after witch you have to keep the hand is so poor choice of a game mechanic it has all the bad design of the magic the gathering and all of dumb down decision making and grind ness of a hearthstone basically the worst of both worlds the premium model is so bad and grind and with the random game losses from over floods or mana screws its useless to try to take it as a serious game as always this will appeal to brain lazy people but i think hearthstone is much better for them then this not recommending this to anybody
early access review considering the game has already been out in other countries and failed this early access is really no excuse for their epic fail doesn't seem like they put that much effort into improving the game crashes lag no action cam combat is he camera angle is he overall it just int that fun to play i will stick with go and do
everything about it is amazing but everything is too challenging and difficult to even unlock the third gun i should not have to pay real money to experience a game that claims to be free to play
early access review playing for more than two months now and in able to get into masters without spending money on this game when it comes to being a free to play game i think this is the best for people not wanting to spend money since you can just grind in game money playing against artificial intelligence then play draft since playing draft is better than buying packs then you can save up some stones to craft some cards and build the deck you like
its exactly what you think it is progress through one thousands rooms of horror in cute style with lots of references to popular creep pastas and games definitely worth checking out and its free what else do you need for positive experienced
product received for free early access review you regenerate automatically medics are useless two there homing weapons apparently who needs aiming three no variance in blocks army weight why be strategic with your building four no tiers because being a noon placed in the same room as pros is fun multiple types of guns on the same robot screw classes am i right six premium everyone is giant regenerating enema army boxes with no promotion of teamwork old this game is garbage i heard a lot about it before but clearly something happened before i got to it
game has cool graphics but is only an online and has no career mode or offline play will not recommend this to friends sad really to say the graphics and physics are fab
i have been looking for a game like this for a long time finally a massively multiplayer online role playing game with a good combat system you can tell this game is made by gamers as everything about it is simple and well done all verification is simple and it actually is free like laugh out loud its pay if you want type content you done have to pay to succeed in the game the player versus player is good and there are fun events and updates best massively multiplayer online role playing game i have ever played the artwork is great and the game int very saggy even with my computer epic story lines and with a tool to let players create there own quests there is an unlimited amount of game play real credit to the makers of never winter fifty five star
early access review hire co owner perez has nothing better to do than to miss a nineteen year old streamer telling him to play the game mode the way you are supposed to with a team and stop crying tips paste in comic anyway they are patching the game according to meaningless data numbers and most of the people left the game all ready this perez guy has no clue about game feeling i bet he never played or himself not recommended since one month every patch they brought out made the game worse and the recent patch tops it all hire obviously done know how to make a good game better and instead they make it worse or could have been great so sad uninstalled
this game is the best game live ever played in years its better than min craft and counter strike global offensive combined with a little pinch of code heard hebron james learned how to play basketball from this game in a nazi and i approve
live played this game off and on for years and am still having fun there are a number of legitimate concerns that have been brought up with other reviews but in the end its a fun free to play game if you like flying driving tanks and blowing stuff up give war thunder a try you've nothing to loose the player base is a mixed bag ranging from frothing insanity to helpful and committed team players and everything in between if you re looking for a recommendation id suggest trying out the game play for a few weeks if you like the game even a little head over to the forums and find yourself a squadron to play with there are a number of dedicated training squadrons that exist to even out the rather steep learning curve having teammates with void makes all the difference here i would not say to ignore negative feedback since there are problems with the game i would say to try it out right now and see if the issues are deal breakers for you
this game is amazing i done subscribe to the this is what a should have been because its better than what i thought a should have been the gems and slots add a whole new element to items and skills i understand the de sync argument but stay away from melee characters and set up a macro for it and de sync is infinitely easier
early access review people keep trying to compare this game to hearthstone i just won a game with what would be lethal damage to me on the stack ill take hearthstone seriously when it has a real priority system that can let that happen
this game contains the dumbest most annoying stupidly ignorant developers of all time they make a game that looks great and is super fun to play but they cant listen to the community and its clear that they done focus enough on how what they make will interact with the common player their community is made up of a bunch of garbage people that look for any form of exploitation with the game mechanics and over time that stupid little exploit refuses rapidly through the community ultimately ruining the game for the rest of us the game is heavy meta based and the people that catch wind of this meta can easily learn it while playing a few matches thus the basis of this review the best part is once the developers learn of this new meta six months later they make changes that last for a good two months and the next best thing that was previously patched becomes meta once again its a constant cycle that never ends about a year ago this game was filled with people who ran away and waited for their opponent to attack to pound them to the next infinity an easy win this is a passive player now this problem was solved and the passive garbage people that once were disappeared like i said earlier the cycle never ends so as of right now the passive player has returned because the deus want to encourage passive play and its now a problem that kind of play style is now back and has the same old meta return with it what in trying to say is the people behind this game have good intentions but they re super oblivious to what goes on in their disgusting community it is unfair how learning meta ultimately gives you the advantage in the long run and ruins the fun until its patched the idea is amazing hence my play time but it is not worth your time its always the same with these kinds of fighting games people take advantage of what they can and ruin the fun for everyone else do not bother with this free game behind all the fun noises and cool looking animations is a community that constantly changes and quickly ruins the good experiences everyone else should be having
i like this game for the fast paced action the risk of losing everything and the deep game play which can suck you for hours and hours upon end room was the first fast paced risk tall game that i have ever played and even though i done play it so much anymore its still a good game despite the nexus you know what in talking about the really tough bosses and oryx himself i always will come back to this game and play it when in not playing team fortress two
an okays free to play mobile game i wouldn't recommend the steam version unless your like me with a cellphone made of dinosaur bones and held together with spit and dreams honestly though this game should have been a pretty big sign that bethesda was going to absolutely dog bugger the fallout lore and cannon done play it unless you've got a really crappy toaster of a personal computer and nothing else will run there probably more entertaining flash games on new grounds that wont try to nickle and dime you or waste every last second of your life and unlike games like girls frontline or kan cole collection there no cute waifs to keep you invested mapping like a degenerate so this game doesn't have much to offer even cookie clicker has more game play as you have to at least click the cookie a few hundred times to get yourself started properly also please god tell me no one has picked up the one hundred and forty dollar nuke cola quantum pack
early access review probably the best alternative to super smash bros out there right now and with it being smoother in terms of movement more responsive and available for free on personal computer the only real things smash has over it is diversity familiar characters and complexity the weapon system however int flawless and although i like the idea of a character having two optional weapons they all function the same besides three special moves that resemble smash attacks from smash bros you have up neutral forward and downwards which is about the only differences between characters besides choice of weapon overall though this game is a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friends out of either not wanting to emulate smash and play through net play or just not owning a wii us this game is definitely worth getting
early access review game was bad to begin with and then they went and removed the classes the main thing that set it apart from the over bloated genre love paladins but leave it to hire to make terrible decisions like these
all i can say is that this game has a lot of charm i look for games that i can personally connect with luck of the draw this one hits a soft spot the deus work on new stuff as we build with their new content so its constantly moving forward and progressing community is cool as long as you are respectful to each servers rules i personally do not hang out in my own spot as i have been helping out with about seven other talented builders in a different server bow new lore needs to be created for all them creepers creeping it real three you know who you are
early access review this is a mob game with big spaceships and even bigger potential whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter but they re definitely on the right track if the premise sounds appealing to you you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission its very well done however it is early access and as such there are a lot of missing functions some balance issues bugs and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed my biggest concern at the moment in terms of i want to have fun right now is the lack of too tip details let me explain you get choices on which weapons abilities to load your ship with however there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name so you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they re supposed to work yes this will obviously be addressed but in the games current state there sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve still once i figured things out i started having a ton of fun and in glad i paid the ten in having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces
els word is a days action packed side scrolling massively multiplayer online brawler with that certain anime charm it borrows a lot of mechanics and functionality from side scrolling brawlers and fighting games but simplifies them into an easy to learn experience while still retaining the intricacies and mastery that fighting games have been known for resulting in a game that enjoyable for all kinds of players even though the game does not feature a character creator like most other mos it instead opts to give you a selection of colourful characters to choose from which meant that the game had a lot more personality and flair going for it by comparison to other games in its genre while the game uses cosmetics and a pay convenience business model you can pay for pretty much everything that not account tied such as extra inventory space from the community market with in game currency which is pretty nice while it is a really fun game to play especially with friends it does fall into the trappings that most korean mos come with being their grind nature and severely expensive item shops despite this i still give this one a solid recommendation to at least try it out because of the amount of fun live personally had with it
early access review tried to like this game but it fails in very important areas players spawn at different times players spawn in random locations guns are very imbalanced cannot edit any settings except sound there were things i did like cool items that give interesting effects graphics optimization
when kenai said were going to focus our market on mobile games nobody believed them then they released this game on android and it was a huge hit cheers for releasing it on personal computer too
i really recommend this game regardless of the tiny almost unnoticeable bugs the game offers great game play and its really fun to play with friends if you re into boardgames then what the hell are you waiting for its free and its amazing i just cant thank my friend enough for showing me this game its like monopoly some can say its even better the style of it is just nice and friendly a cool feature to implement would be text chatting with your teammate or opponent a
just a resin of infestation survivor stories main difference is this is free and still being worked on not so sure about it that much as for infestation survivor stories has stored development
eight thousand three hundred and ten free game free items active community i really suck at this game but i cant find any fault with it this game is free and you can win items achievements and more its the most active game too so finding a game is never a problem free to play accident reviewed as this review helpful or maybe even not helpful either way join this group for more free keys and reviews weekly steam group accident reviewed
business tour is the third game in the monopoly franchise making over four million dollars in the box office with an astounding yes on rotten tomatoes and a great score on meta critic i knew i had to review it so here are the cons for business tour online multiplayer board game takes forever to load the game up crashes if go threw the menus to fast has micro transactions you still make money in the lost island making people just sit there roll the dice and hope they done get doubles has one map if you have coins which cost real money you can re roll the dice and make it so you done lose game starts in windowed mode game starts with all sounds off the music is bad has loot boxes which can only be opened with coins from my knowledge you cant earn coins from just playing the game only from buying them and the chance square only has like ten different cards now here are the pros the four characters you start off with are mint the world championship lets you steroid one of your properties the festivals are a fun mechanic adding emphasis to properties you probably wouldn't of gone for before i always win repurchasing other players properties and then laughing at them is fun you can beef all your places up like crazy and most important of all in better than davis at it i give it a three monopoly out of five
awesome i love how to train your dragon and i love school of dragons i have been playing this game for about a year or more i haven gotten bored playing it and may how to train your dragons title has been released woo woo
early access review honestly it didst start well i tried it during the free week and from what live read about it it was a min craft clone with paying early access that would be released later as a free play game with cash shop starting with the cons after some hours i found out about the waiting game want to convert some blocks into crafting materials you have to wait for a processor to do it want to extract coal obsidian and iron you have to wait and the more precious the material is the longer you wait also you need to craft specific mining cells to gather blocks one for each level stone fossil lava it center and each cell only permits you to gather a few hundreds blocks maybe so you need to craft a new one every two minutes and gathering the materials to craft those cells can be really boring especially the flowers that grow on trees but there is an exploit you can use to get tons of them even the deus suggest that you use it all of this just screams were gonna make you pay to wait less like any stupid facebook game doesn't it something baffling too is that there is no portable light so you have to waste a lot of resources crafting torches or lanterns or waste your time picking them up to place them elsewhere and as their radius is really small you'll need hundreds of them there is also this stupid super jump bug people have been complaining since two thousand and fourteen basically sometimes when you jump your character will jump a high or more and of course when you hit the ground again you die losing all your inventory last thing its about the monsters they are everywhere you just cant dig anywhere without stumbling into a cave full of mobs its not really a problem in itself the real problem is the sound you will hear those monsters through the walls all the time because no matter where you try to build your house there will be a cave nearby live spend hours filling a entire cave with blocks to keep monsters from spawning under my castle so i wouldn't have to hear them now the pros and why i finally bought the game and recommend it well first the deus put it for free for a week so they are pretty confident with their product and know its good after the bad first impression with the waiting game i kept playing more and more and the game itself is good i never played min craft so i cant compare but i played terra ria and star bound and i really prefer creatives sure you have to wait to craft materials but you just need to craft several crafting stations to speed up the process sure you need to wait to gather ore but you can just put an extractor on the node and keep digging around then come back later to gather the ore in the end its no big deal if it stays that way its still a but the game feels finished except for some bugs and poor performances most of the time done know if its a gnu cup or server lag issue but i done think its because of my personal computer i have a gtd and an i there are really nice features one of my favourite being int digging and you can also craft a device that just removes a big square chuck of blocks its really quick you can also craft teleworkers and configure them with codes by putting three objects to create the code so lets say a teleport has three stone blocks as code and you build another teleport you put three stone blocks as destination and am you re teleport to the first one so you can really create a whole network of teleport to fast travel anywhere like one teleport on a beach to gather seashells another one in the snow if you need snow or ice it center exploration is really nice the world is big and full of different biome caves can be really huge and take hours to explore the atmosphere is really well done too bad we need so much torches to light up the path because its mostly pitch black with on some coloured fog to highlight the cave at a distance objects and monsters design are nice too and most textures are pretty good however i find the building materials textures a bit ugly most of the time and its hard to build something that looks good i thought building an obsidian temple would look good but in the end its just a big blocky blue house also the character can rust fast and jump high controls are good too and for once the user interface and inventory are pretty effective compared to terra ria which was a nightmare to play all this makes a rather enjoyable experience so if you re looking for an almost finished game just buy it or wait for it to be free to play and possibly destroyed by a shitty business model hope it wont be though
its great truly this game is pretty awesome only problem docs more precisely their prices in lithuania for example to get all the downloadable content you need to pay eight hundred euros that like an entire average job paycheck its ridiculous and makes no sense good game pretty much ruined by greedy developers ont go all they need money to develop games and stuff that not an excuse to limit the entire player base to the one inheres some advice get in nineteen forty is for ten bucks install the cup mod and boom you have we planes through to modern era jets with a lot of campaigns if you wish to install them and hundreds of hours of fun
product received for free early access review this game use to be fun and balanced sub machine gun field fast and did small amount of damage per shot plasma use to fire slowly and do a large amount of damage per shot you could fire infinite number of times with only one thing stopping you which was reload antiaircraft gun seal destroyed flyers and hello helicopters with a medium power need and reload of twenty three seconds you were able to buy mega wheels and mega sags it center in the shop but now sub machine gun fire slowly and do a large amount of damage and the things stopping you is reload and a power limit plasma fires rapidly with small reload and takes medium amount of power which seams unbalanced because you can peak out and empty your power and hide antiaircraft gun hardly destroys helicopters and flyers and takes a giant power cool down with a medium reload of seconds but and here is a big one you cant purchase mega sags or sags of higher tier actually you can only buy beginning tier stuff but the rest of it you can only get by supply drops or drops from chest which is totally unfair because free am makes you buy drops supply drops and still you have to hope for stuff that you want and it starts turning into a pay to win pay to win which seams real unfair and you also have to unlock stuff that you want which want already enough it us to be fun but not anymore
early access review truly amazing for a game the graphics give you a slandered feeling of old retro gaming with nintendo number one it game super smash bros overall its a well made game with an amazing feeling to it
early access review this game is going to be an hit live played both cut and was well impressed plenty of guns and skins game play very well made say good by to warfare laugh out loud bryan a make me laugh to everyone go get game now and install the new must have game of twenty seventeen for free
early access review valhalla is a great smash platform remake it is very fun to play with many people and has great strategic game play however the game play itself is the worst kind imaginable its servers are probably the worst i have played on ever live explored to see if this is coming from my home internet connection but it is actually coming from the direct servers themselves every single game i have played lags immensely and is sometimes unbearable there needs to be a massive update for multiplayer and server performance
early access review they killed the core mechanics with the last patch not worth playing until they fix that it might sound harsh but its really bad that why they lost ninety five of their player base in one week
only played twenty one hours through steam as i only recently linked it but hundreds of hours through the normal launcher uninstalled the game today due to foreigner the development taking the out of their customers players with the furore over the role play apart site scandal great great run by an awful company
product received for free early access review understand that the game should be fun and silly seeing as what it is but its downright unplayable the crosshair doesn't show where you re aiming the knife is a one hit kill and it seems that no matter how much ammo you pour into someone they wont die live only been killed by knives because nobody uses firearms the movement is very bad and even though i have a low ping roughly thirty is and high frames one hundred and twenty frame locked the game is very choppy when i corrected the volume so the environment want too loud i noticed the gun fire was almost silent compared to footsteps doors ambient sounds it center i know i got it for free but what about the people that pay for it had i paid for it i would refund it almost immediately
played this for over two years used to be a great game once daybreak took over things started getting meh but it was still decent and playable then daybreak decided to hire one of the you tubers called rel the brain damage of this red kid who thinks he can be a developer totally broke the games balance of course it did so mostly for one side if you absolutely must play this i recommend avoiding van at the time of writing this is had nearly all of its unique features removed most recent removal rip lancer the remaining ones are honestly utter cup aphelion nerved to oblivion spa lancer or so very situational that they re a joke when mentioned in combat lasher hill climbing which up till some time ago was a highly overrated ability of only van fail raider has been significantly improved on other tanks strafing is a joke with the speed that tank shells travel at and the special abilities that other tanks have anchor shield are significantly more useful forgiving and newbie and pro friendly compared to what maggie could ever offer in terms of guns from the experience of two is chars battle royal one hundred and twenty and battle royal one hundred and nine one no brand one to by is guns are medicare they do not excel at anything supposedly jacks of all trades which is an obvious lie is guns also have something called no bullet drop yet another thing that is highly overrated because it matters only on long ranges and even at that point bullet drop is easy to compensate for after some time but guess what the vast majority of the game is close quarters combat stick your nose out of the building die if you re not with a zero why because of superiority of other factions tanks over maggie and other factions specific harasser guns over what is has to offer no guns heavy hitting with medium fire rate and very easy when it comes to controlling recoil also jackhammer a burst shotgun laugh out loud that can kill any character in one mouse button click la anchor is awesome gauss saw is one of my favourite starter weapons remember that deployment shield sunday next to a base well that not a problem for a phoenix a rocket that you control from a safe spawn room while its slowly flying just get a friend to drop a mines while you keep the shield down to spray and pray hello rpm lynx rpm armistice my personal favourites here were armistice and the burst sniper rifle trap a yea you can burst fire with snipers what about maxes well no maxes are a long known joke in game not in terms of funny but because they have been for soon long and are so overpowered with their inst kill shotguns and yet no still cries about them being only cd only which has ages ago been proven to be a lie by a few you tubers sniping at medium ranges with mattocks and slug attachments of they also have a special shield that blocks damage and two laser guided rockets launchers to good weapons and anchor the same as their tank has basically you cant move but you gain massive bonus to reload speed fifty faster and shell travel speed thirty faster for the prowler and fire rate projectile speed and reload time fifty faster on a max its worth noting that you can turn anchor on and off at any time and it takes less than one second to get back to the normal mode to run away want to block a room get two anchored maxes with pounders are grenades and shoot at the door but hey what do is have an awesome zoe at max rank this beauty gives you ten more damage output in exchange for receiving twenty more damage and this was still considered overpowered by rel that a quote check his videos if you wish to confirm that if that not enough then take a look at aircraft ultimate farming machines to which you will die way too often and which you will rarely ever kill because lock on are so easy to avoid counter by semi experienced players and because they do cup damage and guess what almost no one bothers shooting at aircraft also empire specific fighters are damn quiet when flying slowly so they can and will sneak up on you and farm you over and over and over of course jailbreak fails to see how broken these are so you re stuck with being a farming meat shield for an undefined amount of time moreover a while ago daybreak implemented an anti cheat drug called battle eye into the game this did practically nothing aside from adding an additional clogs for your cup there are still tons of cheaters check youtube for planet side two muscle cattleman a video from a day ago reporting such people does literally nothing you will still see them all the time the biggest joke was a while ago when a guy with a name starting with literally obliterated anything and everything with an archer a very slow firing anti material rifle be it galaxies tanks people through walls it center it center it center and last but not least the requirements an intel core i seven four thousand and seven hundred and seventy a processor with unlocked multiplier wed overclocked from thirty six to ghz with an eva before gtd nine hundred and eighty to hybrid we i had issues with keeping this game at sixty first person shooter and no were not talking ultra settings here no a or he resolutions either i tried this at a at some point but it was unplayable so as you can see things are going only downhill for playstation two it used to be cool it used to be unique i loved the long battles the competitive game play and so many different play styles and ways to approach each base but jailbreak did its great job with hiring that rel who wrecked this decent title into the trash that it is now conclusion avoid there are a lot better titles out there there is no point in playing a game where the so called deus create such an imbalance and claim its all of is large parts of the community are extremely toxic
early access review this game is definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoyed counter strike cod or any similar old time shooters honesty didst expect much from a free to play but live been pleasantly surprised with this game there absolutely no pay to win features unless for some reason you consider cosmetics pay to win the maps are small but balance to those complaining about snipers the maps are clearly split into different areas with different lanes there a cross map lane for snipers and usually along the left and right hand sides of the maps there is a csc or rifle range area for those who done enjoy sniping the game is extremely fast paced and the matches a rent long so its a pretty relaxed enjoyable game to play
this is without a doubt the best instance based massively multiplayer online role playing game anyone will ever play in the existence of video games every time i try a new massively multiplayer online role playing game i end up right back where i started here i hit the one thousand hour mark in roughly three months this means that half of my life in that time period was dedicated to this beast of a game with the remaining twelve hours consisting of school sleep bathroom breaks and food so yes i absolute singly recommend this game but be warned if you play this game you will have no life however if you play this game with friends you will have no soul
i loved clicker heroes and i sure love yentai this is the best mix of my two favourite things ever i love it i only play with moans only because my mon thinks i done watch enough porn in seven years old done judge me mph
early access review this game is like playing a dude that is drunk and he got on pans and bags on his arms when you go to try to aim its all slow and you have no control fps and it plays like one hundred and twenty three first person shooter that will be a no for me dawn
live played this game for a couple years now and have stuck by its side through thick and thin live seen multiple update rages many update praises and so much more that doesn't even begin to explain the time live had playing the game though team fortress two has so many amazing things you can do and even specialize in you can pick from nine classes and several different weapon combinations within those classes to perfect your own play style technically speaking the game int limited to nine classes either slap a sword and shield on your demo an and you get a demo night a completely different play style from the bomb lobbing drunk scottish man slap a gunslinger and a few good weapons on the engineer and you get the combat engineer a more aggressive member of the team who when played right can actually help more than you think there so much more to the game than just a simple shooter with community servers running custom game modes that you wouldn't even expect to be in a game like this while not all are fun give them a try you may like them the community has its ups and downs but most communities have those occasionally you will find a really toxic player which can ruin the moods of many people or someone really salty or a troll but done let them get to you try to be the good in the community and maybe things will change me ill admit i can be quite toxic and salty a lot of the time but i try to be good where it counts you've got hundreds even thousands of game groups all specializing in certain things in team fortress two whether it be your favourite game mode or a group dedicated to rocket jumping there almost everything you could want from it updates a very controversial subject especially recently with the meet your match update i will admit when my first came out i was part of the angry torch toting crowd bent on destroying valve but they very quickly noticed that the community was not taking too kindly to the update and made some announcements and changes valve doesn't always listen but when they do they do a good job of it they've tried at least a little to fix the problem at least give them credit for that give them time in sure well all come back to it eventually and valve will get stuff fixed up there a lot and i really do mean a lot of things i haven explained here in team fortress two you just gotta play it and find them for yourself whether or not you enjoy the game int up to me and i wouldn't feel any different if you hated it in not going to shove it down your throat okay maybe a little edit the pro update jungle inferno changed the game up quite a bit which unsurprisingly sparked quite a bit of anger from people in the community i was angry with the update at first but as things started to calm down a bit it started to feel like normal again even if an update is good or bad give it some time and think rationally about the changes that are happening change is something people dislike so it comes as no surprise that when change happened people got mad give the game some time and focus more on the core of it all and in sure it will stay enjoyable edit two updates are few and far between so done expect many to happen they do happen just not often the community at least most of it i think has come to terms with the lack of updates and is kind of use to it at this point an update is more a nice surprise than it is a cool new feature or something at this point old play the game done get mad lots of features done be toxic more than displayed try to enjoy games no matter what situation you are in people can be crappy just get through it and done and fuel to the flames May
first off i just want to say i loved this game when i was younger but now all i see is a true pay to win game second i was expecting that the beginners guide didst change but it did and in the worst way possible saw multiple people confused on how to open the cage lock and that is what most of gamers call a beginners trap now i see why everyone is hating this game please make an effort in changing the game not make it a easy cash game please
i like this game its really nice that they got tons of events and characters whats make this game never boring best mob i ever played total not the only mob i played or something
early access review buggy as hell cant play with friends armour is pointless any kind of my wont kill past ten yards making them pointless trust me i have tried this over and over and over and every time i die its to a rifle making my point even more valid i know its men to be a joke and stab a pub but tbs i would rather play pub in the state its in atm as this game if you want to call it that is so far just a collection of assets edit people now make no sound at all you make all the noise in the world them nothing
early access review would totally recommend this game this is the first game i played in steam and i totally loved it i am sure if a give it a try a will love it also its a lot like counter strike global offensive
product received for free this game is good but it has soon too many bugs and the server lags so much many times i actually won the game but it didst end it waited until i lose you know whats the most frustrating thing in the world its losing when a actually won
heroes and generals is now out of early access so lets take a look excellent foundation good technical achievements incredibly poor design choices and missing management that about sums it up but lets elaborate on that the foundation of the game the battles themselves as infantryman are good vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal the physics and gun system are good once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitball but then there are things missing and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point flanking works well you can stay still and let your came make you near invisible even with the default uniforms but this is not really used that much you can use it all be the ultimate soldier and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets there is no penalty for dying not for you at least but more on that later and you done really get rewarded for anything you do either you play to play and you win because you want to win then lets get right to the poor design choices this game is not just pay to win but pay to progress the way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game do you want to group up with a few friends if there more than two then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the skill of having a group after that prepare for a lot more grind as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier and if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades you re going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications because every single bullet shot grenade thrown mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot this leads directly to the player base adapting to the mentality life is cheap ammo is expensive if you shoot someone you should pick up their gun because nine times out of ten it will be better than yours even if you've spend fifty hours on the game of course there are other issues mainly around balance and the generals portion of the game ill spare you the complaints on balance its the usual for pay to win games but more on that other bit later that said if you done mind the grind and are fine using subpar weapons for most of your starting hours the basic infantry combat is good stuff moving along to tanks you will find that they re not amazing but certainly entertaining and useful your view is a bit limited when using them but you can generally work them quite well air planes are a joke and they likely always will be do not even consider getting a fighter because you will be less useful to your team than if you had nothing but a pistol and the idea that you might surprise the enemy if you drive your car right at them controls are awful planes done do anything and you take up a valuable spot on the team that could have been used by someone useful prepare for a long time of flying around not seeing anything and not doing anything and then on to the big complaint with this game when you re not accounting for the fact that you may as well just be playing a basic trial of the game unless you pay them lots of money the generals part it may as well not exist the game may even be better if it did not exist the entire generals section is deeply flawed to the point that it is literally unplayable first you need to slowly grind your way up to being allowed to use it then you will need to spend three days to wait for a small squad of the absolute lowest tier divisions to spawn so you can use them they will die in about five minutes and they will have gained no experience everything except infantry is essentially impossible to afford unless you pay the deus money for it which will last only a few days at most and then you lose them the map is incredibly poor and you will never have anything resembling a strategy merely people throwing their units around hoping it works sometimes it does work too but this is never because of any skill at command it all comes down to the people playing the war battles and they done care people will spawn in expensive tanks so that they can drive up to a building and get it blown up by at because they done have to pay for those tanks the guy who got the tank brigade does same for air planes infantry spawns and vehicles why would they care that you've waited three days to get your infantry squad filled they will run into machine gun fire and then re spawn to do it again until you lose your squad they will spawn every single vehicle available when they have one thousands infantry spawns and three hundred vehicle spawns and they fight one hundred and sixty infantry and ten vehicles and because these vehicles de spawn after use they are gone and they remain gone the only thing here for you is frustration and poorly designed mechanics a map that does not work properly and ideas that died before they were put into the game and that is most of what you will find when you manage to progress past being a basic rifleman with stock gun a game with great ideas pretty good technical achievements but a team that does not understand even the most basic of design and doesn't care either greed above all else and a complete lack of awareness long ago when this was an early build i gave them a small bit of cash because they had a great concept good basic game play and claimed to have plans to make it better i wanted to support them since they were a small group that seemed to be making something great i regret that i could have burned that money and it would have gone to better use the game int better than it was back then its worse and its showing no signs of ever improving may
one thing i can say about this game is that the community is a mixed bag you will see a lot of players online that just done know how to do anything but stand still and spam moves on the ground which is jarring to me since i come from the super smash bros community and have played melee extensively despite this the game holds its place as one of the better couch party games on steam as its so easy to just sit back and play with your friends you will have a lot of fun playing with the vast selection of characters and even see new ones every now and then if you want to play a well polished fighting game and have an empty wallet pick this game up
my favourite free to play game i currently have two hundred and twenty hours in and i haven to spent a cent on it yes it does take some time to get more advanced planes but if you can be patient about it you can still unlock them without purchasing anything the graphics are amazing and the game play is intense you could get into firefights that could last up many minutes there a no reason for you not to try this game out it is also extremely optimized so you can play this game on a less powerful rig
one thousand five hundred hours of playtime time for a review so in the past live written early review and i want always happy about the progress of fixing problems but after a while now live discovered it is best to wait before commenting people a rent always update with the reported bugs when so an update is in the making as for the pamela depending on your in game graphic settings the experience can be altered by adding more or less options play single player multiple modes available to practice when your friends are offline when online just battle each other my game gear min recommended for medium to high experience processor intel core i seven thousand seven hundred memory der sixteen go graphics vida before gtd ten sixty go memory der sixteen go steering wheel thrust master try with of add on two the shifters and pedals crew chief some additional packs from race room store date two thousand and eighteen so live bought myself a median eraser a mixed reality headset to play in virtual reality it has become a whole new game
early access review an impressive min craft copy with nice visuals and good optimized frame rate this game is a lot like a game that is known for all of us min craft you could say this is a graphically improved my with new features pretty much a mod not only it looks nice it is also free to play and has no hidden costs being free to play the developers recently released a pro package giving some extras to those who pay one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine the pro package will give a double stamina a glider custom maps increased inventory and some other things you can read it on the store page this is bad in a way as this will divide the gamers making this a little bit more pay two win however despite this game being completely free i done really see a huge issue behind this downloadable content you can think it as if you would be buying a game if twenty is too much right now then wait for the sales as i would recommend or go ahead and support the deus by buying the new downloadable content it is up to you skipping the previous this game is worth checking out
so my friend and i both got team fortress two back when it was in the orange box and i played that for about two years then my personal computer died and i didst play it for six years then got a new personal computer and started playing it again it was still good then i stored playing it for about an other year came back to it about four months ago game was still good then the update came out seven thousand seven hundred and sixteen and the game is now a copy of counter strike global offensive done get this once great game its now really bad if they change it back to the way it was i would tell people to get it but now no
exceptionally pay to win game which is a shame because the game is actually well made even at the lowest levels the game lets you literally purchase so much power that you can be a as powerful as a free players on your level this is especially noticeable in player versus player where someone the same level as you can three shot you in less than four seconds regardless of your gear or skill level this is also a de worse due to the class balance letting some classes be a as powerful as others add pay to win on top of a overpowered class and you have a nearly literal walking go mode that can solo party dungeons with ease avoid this wallet arriving game unless your a whale
live tried laugh out loud data and a few other mobs but i just couldn't get into the isometric click est after having played the beta i gave smite another shot when it launched fifteen years ago and i never looked back more than a one thousands hours later in still playing every single day it will take you some time and practice to get used to it all but its more accessible compared to other mobs due to it having less items and being able to turn on autobus level positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming timing communication and synergy making it hard to master the game is based on mythology from seven different pantheons and the sixty nine gods at the time of writing all have lore related directed taunts which adds a lot of humour to the mix five different classes eight game modes on five different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone regular updates and patches keep the game fresh with plenty of free gems events and sales you wont need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you done want to i have accumulated a of gems and free stuff in my playtime being the third biggest mob with second largest tournament prize pools in sports history i think i can safely say hire finally hit the right spot with this game the only negative things i can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky which int too big of a deal if you done play ranked leagues as with any online game you get a few toxic players every now and then but they can easily be muted or ignored and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your matches furthermore i can recommend playing queueing with friends once you get used to the third person and aiming turn off autobus level and use sites like tie monster com for item builds the bots in coop game modes are horribly bad get into player versus player as soon as possible read some guides and watch streams to improve your game if you enjoy the game get the ultimate god pack unlocks all god future gods its the best deal in mob games vol good luck vhf have fun would kappa again
updated review seventy thousand seven hundred and fifteen about the games flaws this game includes two different game a before level forty easy enjoyable you can be kobe hebron you think so a after level forty when you face the real players including very high skill guys very good teams very heavy pay to win guys you will be shocked after playing against these guys you will think they are cheating you will be frustrated may be you will quit playing the game now you are the ultimate rookie by getting to this point before level forty this game may seem easy but it is not so after becoming level forty and even being a level fifty with good piece of equipment you are so weak put aside the pay to win equipment cards which some of the cards you can acquire with in game currency and events but the best clothes are time limited so you need to pay real cash to make them permanent the real problem you still have no idea about this game passing at the right time finding the free teammate when to fake when to drive when to shoot all of them requires deep knowledge about the game play and big experience average player needs thousands of games to be a competitive level fifty and for each different position you still need additional experience you need a good team or a good crew and the friendship mechanics crew mechanics are awful in this game so basic like designed for handheld basic nintendo you find a good guy he knows about this game so you be friends but only with that position you have no idea about his other chars at some point you have five chars and you time to time play with each other like all the other guys who are into the game so there should be a main char name so by only interaction with that char will be enough to communicate with players all other chars the crew function basic your team clan totally awful as a crew master you have so limited options you can not classify sort you can do nothing useful you can only delegate managers accept players or kick players out of crew you have to spend enormous time to have a good crew you have to know each player well that is not practicable you must have as a crew master ability to see player stats i done mean attrib but total stats or monthly stats as you can see yours i think you can not even see the level of your crew members laugh out loud you can see this during their application only you can not see inactive players as you can not sort anything you can not assign them titles like rookie veteran pro or whatsoever to classify them which is a must in a serious clan crew based massively multiplayer online the games lottery system prize system so rigged lots of times you will get very piece of junk items like one hundred points or even blank if the system briefly tell you there is high chance of getting items it is okay but you see the wheel of fortune for example there is lets say twenty four pieces one of them is one hundred points smallest prize you turn it ten times and five times you get one hundred points come on this is bullshit than put more piece and increase number of one hundred points this is like slot machines with cheating mechanisms casino wins all the time information given by the game about almost everything is so small like three point attribute three point success rate which one is what which one includes what which is better no info what about tussle who needs tussle what is that so you will spend your valuable points on stats you will never need because you have no idea there should be some graphical improvements like anti alias may be there should be optimisation of network code still we have disconnects from match loading screens match would not start for multiple tries some lags which affects game play a player three meters left of you can block you with the help of or spock with a teleportation so final state of the game pros still great game play seems like deus are listening players after steam some of the problems are sorted out after steam release old the pros are valid from first review cons still pay to win big gap after level forty with high levels gap with experienced or and pay to win players awful friendship interface lacking of an appointed main char for general relations and comes awful crew system flawed lottery system lack of information about the game stats need improved graphics need better network code old review i have been playing this game during out i have one level fifty of lvi thirty six a lvi twenty even so lvi five of also i had played is long time ago so do not mind the steam play time first things first this game is pay to win pay to win with earned points you can purchase items which will give you around five attrib but if you purchase item with real money you can go up to thirteen or even eighteen so this is the pay to win aspect of the game also there is the toy thing which can be a you will encounter pm who can steal all your balls really annoying a balance issue much more than pay to win although pay to win makes them so strong at stealing side from this i definitely recommend this game because it is so much fun you can level up to level fifty final and build a good player you can compete with others wallet warriors you can compete with others by team play and skill so if you have a good team crew friends yes you will enjoy this game if you like basketball yes you will enjoy this game beware you can not be a jordan or kobe trying so will gain you only frustration you need team play if you are high level with good items and skills yes you can be kobe my not so sure pro nice graphics basketball online at best three divisions according to your level so you done get smashed by high levels if you understand the game and be a team player super fun cons pay to win need somehow good ping out players can be a bit unfriendly they do not have the patience for rookies boobs difficult to understand core game mechanics for a newbie including cards toys and game play after steam release game is experiencing lag which i have encountered one in a fifty games series during out so this is an issue now a major con was the low player base i hope it will change with steam this game deserves it overall seven thousand five hundred and ten a great game if it was not pay to win it would be a nine yes i do recommend no body is perfect bow i see most of negative reviews is due to absence of sea server so this guys want this game to fail instead of earning money and starting a sea server may
if you re looking for a challenging first person shooter that all give you hours of competitive game play as well as an unique community and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative look no further team fortress two is one of the most fun amazing one faking games that live played not alone does the nine different classes grow on you the game itself is amazing featuring unique fun game modes as payload or at def if you re not convinced just yet the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miss community created as well as valves own all in all team fortress is by the community for the community now i understand if you find looking at people and clicking hard or cook that grenade just right but in team fortress two you done ness scarily have to there much more to the game than just being the first to draw fire heck there int even that many gun to top it all off its free you might think a then its a pay town and you be absolutely wrong with the unique drop system you'll be sure to acquire new firearms by the end of the day if not a hat or two
early access review its fun and works damn well but i tend to rage at the game more than any other live ever played and since its in beta it does have a few bugs and maybe slight hotbox problems otherwise its a great game
as someone who played hundreds of hours this game has become unplayable after the latest update how am i to play a match where it is ten is five for multiple rounds no auto lance no team switching no voting at all fix your game valve you've already lost me maybe you can keep other people
yes legends is fun well designed and has its own personality out of nowhere it has become a strong contender in the car based battle its not as pretty as hearthstone and its lack of responsiveness is sometimes annoying but dire wolf digital tackled game play mechanics expertly making the elder scrolls legends hearthstone a main rival
an excellent game that involves both left and right hands with a little use of the tongue it also involves back stabbing team immigrants who love to spam chat and report any who stand in there way meanwhile in the air an army of fat fifty year old virgins with joysticks shoot you down and your family while they feed you pees overall an excellent term producing game the still is better then of goodies gates
early access review hottie idea behind this game is okay its pretty fun for a while solo and with friends the free to play model works and it feels okay not unfair at this very moment it got a little boring at least for me after nineteen hours of playing not a bad game by any means is just highly repetitive and goal oriented some people might like this not really the dream game for me but its good solid early access title had no technical issues playing this game thumbs updo i recommend it yes have fun jumping in three hundred and twenty one

spawn bad player interaction bad survival bad combat bad graphics bad micro transactions plenty cant say anything good about this garbage of a game its free but it is a waist of time if you want a free zombie survival game play unturned not this garbage i wouldn't play this trash if someone paid me
i have never played a game as much as i play smite since mid to late season two i have had the wonderful opportunity to play smite as my first mob ever all the items abilities and skilled players were very intimidating at first but the growth through the game was truly an amazing feeling many people hate that smite has changed so much but personally i am thrilled with every change they make because the beauty of this game is how power of items and gods are always shifting and changing allowing new play styles and ways of strategy this game has truly shaped me on a realistic level as me and my friends have bonded over it if you are thinking of trying this game you must i personally believe there is a bit of a learning curve but once you find your perfect character and get your first victory then positive cd then pentax and all the way to placing in ranked you will hopefully find as much enjoyment as i have i will continue to play this game for a very long time and will proudly declare smite to be my favourite game
early access review a great game for its value although all the hate roll reviews out there this game is not that bad it is actually kinda good and fun when you start playing it the only thing this game needs is better servers you will often see player models do some mini teleport or rubber banding and no balanced witch is something i actually thing makes this game fun to play because there is almost no recoil in the guns enabling you to head shot so easily
early access review fun game shame the pay to play scale is more towards the side of pay to have fun otherwise you'll just get on but i can definitely see that it would be fun if you re willing to throw money at it
considering its an idle clicker there are many different paths that prevent the game from becoming mind numbingly repetitive the bane of many click rescue games every time you reset to gain new bonuses the multitude of achievements also give you a sense of purpose and a goal to strive for for a game i initially downloaded to idle in while offline live somehow spent a lot of time in game since the game was and still is free play i told myself i had nothing to lose in giving it a try but trust me it wont be long before that first click becomes just one more click enjoy and click at your own risk
the game feels very cheap i couldn't change from controller back to keyboard and the controls in general are poorly chosen also there are limited free cars most you have to pay for
when you want to like a game but cant how to refund all content i actually bought starter pack spa track forty five just to compare with other games that in playing a acc of it i tried and must say it cant be compare to str physic even when they added more but its no longer fun and i cant feel the car like i did in str even worse than a i think its time the developer should realize this is a game and its realism must make sense instead of pure match and trying to add things that we cant feel through eyes and hands graphic even more fancy but still cant compare to great tone ease on eyes and user interface design of it cars tracks maybe more but saying good bye to your ferrari and lamborghini perhaps clare and mercedes am will be your best friends i just done feel right i want to refunded end of story is i love sim in games like str and really hope they make str the same less is more sometimes guys what end user feel is more important than match he
been playing since orange box though did get heavily into it until a few years after that rewards skilled players but not impenetrable to new players still gets new content despite having become free play for a long time now ticks a lot of boxes for me scalable engine linux native competitive shooter active community some things have changed for the worse but over all its a great game you be doing yourself a disservice not to try it out
early access review was very sceptical about this game when my friends were trying to convince me to play as i am not a fan of battle royal style games normally i was quick to change my mind when i actually got into it with a group of friends and we were running a four man fire team the map is large but there are many ways to traverse it assuming you take the time to plan to make the most of your forms of transportation gunplay is intense as the game accounts for velocity and bullet drop with sags and shotguns feeling lethal in close combat while the dedicated sniper rifle if you can find a scope for them actually give you the ability to get kilometre standoff distances assuming visibility is good the assault rifles cover the middle ground with some tending more to feeling like sig like the gro a and a while others tend to be better at longer range like the lvov and am the vehicle physics are absolutely legendary you can drive trucks up eighty slopes at kph and given the ridiculous terrain features this is a huge plus and leads to some hilarious moments as well the graphics are good nothing exceptional but when you reach a mountain peak or are riding in the ski lifts scattered around the map you are blown away by the fantastically designed landscape the game is surprisingly optimized as well in playing on a laptop with a item and a fourth gen i and in usually around one hundred and twenty first person shooter on the high settings even in intense firefights or the snowstorms that occur as a battle royal i give this game a nine hundred and ten its a simple game you grab guns you get attachments you follow the zone you kill the enemy teams it doesn't do anything groundbreaking while at the same time having enough small changes to the formula to make it stand out and actually be worth playing with your buddies as a whole game experience seven hundred and ten they supposedly have a ave mode coming sometime next year as well and the player versus player has given me enough of a reason to stick around to see where this goes
playing on conquest going mid lane and i see a couple of minions on my way through the jungle and i say hey ill just grab some extra what the fucking meeerrriiicccaaa freedom rang and it was loud
live only played the game for a little under three hours at this point but in really enjoying it so far its like league of legends but in space i am a huge fan of space sims and mobs and this game does a great job of putting the two together also i really do love the fact that ships can makeover in full three dimensional space not just along one plane but up and down as well i think it shows great promise and will continue to play
early access review space shooting action controls are tight and precise taking a bit of time to get used to and combat is crazy at times but it all adds to the fun now though in not sure i played this when it first came onto green light and since then i joined the military if only my military issue internet was worth a damn i could actually play it
early access review very well optimized game runs at fix one hundred and fifty first person shooter with a medium low end system art style is more like world of aircraft hand painted textures than footnote i think its looks good has different characters with different abilities and weapons looting system is very simple you can craft you own legendary arm or from shards that you get from dis enchanting loot that you done need so its not a ring loot est if you survive to the endgame you will always have twelve legendary items just like your enemies good game overall
be me soulless peekaboo that is trying to look for a free to play game with boobs one day looking at the store page of steam sees laura clicker the name didst appeal to me but hey what do i have to lose for free yentai downloads game at lightning fast joe enter game click once hear a moan satisfied outlet me hear some more of that moan and thus a game where i can finally play with one hand and while the other maps is born
tried too hard in this game so called overpowered classes are going to come in and ruin your day with the power of dank memes player versus player player base is stupidly mind boggling when they call you daggers instead they are the ones that are lagging and are looking for safe zones where they will think they are the ones not at fault then there are the ones that straight up yells you noon any lao nine hundred and eleven
this is a great horror game beaten it in one sitting the soundtrack is what really makes you stand on your toes all the time it adds a lot of tension and atmosphere to its locations and rooms and chases monsters are straight up terrifying done let those cardboard cutouts fool you probably one of the best horror games live played this year also this game has really good references without saying it get it bad ending is the best ending
meh skip all the lame recycled dialogue and cutaways and you would have just another generic pay to win grind collectible card game there are many others that have have made cash grabs i mean cogs like these exceedingly better bethesda has really turned into a manure producer
its alright to be honest not very noon friendly many mechanics are confusing or not properly explained and need a wiki search or two to understand to piggyback on the previous point some mechanics seem purposefully obscure can be difficult to know what your build needs to progress or get better and may find yourself relying on the community for help art community is great some people are helpful about builds on the sub edit the official forums are pretty build guides are often inaccurate or misleading and are updated for current patch despite lacking promised content from leagues ago such as videos clearing bosses or else vouch threads are useless as no negative comments can be made cant really trust anything especially considering the to scammers usually get their way and you done if you want to look good be prepared to pay lots of money nearly all of the in game items have terrible in game art that doesn't adjust properly to character model and size does not fit with any other armour and clips through most things in fact even the micro transactions that costs some four thousand and sixty dollars will only fit with its own pieces and no mind is paid about how it interacts with other micro transactions or in game items fashion is very hard and very pricey after four years and still there is no ability to save a preset of your hideout so you may spend dozens of hours designing your home and wont be able to carry it over to the new league read more about leagues interesting game design all things considered the game plays pretty well i would avoid hardcore even if you like to play games for a challenge i like playing on hardest settings but for this game most deaths are out of your control and will cost you hundreds of hours of game play worst case scenario May
early access review the re spawn system delays the game play for so long because you spend ages running toward the objective to be immediately kill by someone camping the objective in an awkward spot to kill and if you re a newcomer you done have any weapons to combat this so the game becomes a running simulator plus the gunplay int anything special feels kinda clunky
nice and fun game personally i hate mobs but made an exception for this one it is fun to play and addictive also third person view something i really liked compared to limo the a a a a a view angle from common mobs
you get hats you sell hats for more hats it is a vicious cycle once you get more hats you sell those for more hats hats are everywhere all hail gabon the lord of savings all hail valve the lords of hats
tips store steam powered you want to ruin your hole life this is the perfect game for you you will lose your will to live in just seconds nicene
this game is a mixture between world of war craft and diabolo it plays like world of war craft with the same viewpoint same looting systems and game play it center in doing player versus player gaining glory in order to buy player versus player gear doing heroic dungeons to get epic gear at max level but it then has a diabolo twist with the same style gear system and ability system where you have a limited number of spells and you have to choose the best builds loving the game so far and played seventy hours i would recommend to everybody
this is a fun game can be a little unbalanced at times and sometimes you get stuck with a deep team but it is fast paced within only a day of game time live already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank i think this game has a lot of potential edit after a few days of grinding i think its only fair to update my review first off the teams are rarely useful tier in tanks are also rarely useful i cant tell you how many matches live played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself which only dooms your team and done even get me started on the huge gap between tier in and tier a tanks at leas in tier i in you can damage the enemy live played the german japanese and american skill tree working on the russians now and i can tell you tier is are way too over armoured even using premium ammo i only damage them maybe one out of ever six shots and its never enough to actually contribute grinding in this game to get from tier in to tier a means you join as many battles as you can and watch your win ration slowly go down earning a year one hundred and fifty to two hundred experience points per match until you have the staggering a experience points it takes to research a tier a with all that said tier i iii is super fun and usually fairly balanced i still see potential in this game
its a good game the game play are similar to diabolo amazing plot incredible quest and good history the only negative in this game is when you start the game it long time to beginning
early access review how to play step one make a robot step two kill other peoples robot step three upgrade your robot step four repeat and waste ten hours a day playing this game would play again
early access review this game started off great but as it gets patched more and more the hit detection gets worse the latest major patch rommel broke it entirely there are numerous threads about it and the deus response has been to blame it on the player base stating its client side lag it is not watch some of the videos it is a free game but after a round or two the frustration of the broken mechanics kicks in and will have you looking for a new shooter
you used to be able to take more than four shots but now every death is about four shots everyone hits critical without any trouble bombers are no longer flying fortresses like they were they are just bigger four shot kills this game is no longer any fun
the most fun part arena drafted deck locked behind currency either re or in game grinder every game is mobs mobs mobs ends up super boring to just spam creatures on the table free to play grind for cards is nice that it can be targeted puzzles fun ave story decent fun but both only have a small pool of availability upfront need to grind dailies or spend re money to play more
incredible game with a high chance of getting addicted great reason to return for every new challenge league and regular huge updates the reason i started playing areas and it is still absolutely amazing after over five hundred more hours
early access review didst play this game very much but the parts i have experienced are very repetitive it has a battlefield like game play but with much more variety in things to do it has vast maps but for some reason seems to fall back behind the big name titles as far as entertainment goes
war thunder is a good world war two warplane video game for the personal computer and pops but not balance some planes are over tired and some are just low tired some planes are so bad it is impassible to fly and shot down other planes with but still one of the best world war two warplane game out there
the game is a lot of fun so far a lot of people are saying once you get to tier thirty four ships its massively unfair but i haven experienced that in not doing as good as i was in the recruit league but i generally am getting more kills than deaths and most of my deaths are because i put myself in a bad position or something
live played this game for years on congregate and when i saw it on steam i downloaded it immediately this is a great role playing game game that makes you collect and better yourself with quests and loot however this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience you can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them i strongly suggest getting this game if you have a friend or two to play it with May
its a fun time waster and once you get it down you done even have to spend money to progress at this point sending a few bucks on gems is just to support the maker am at reincarnation eight with out really trying to speed through
early access review latest update killed the game deus went full sellout mode on pay to win people use wall glitches to their advantage unbalanced teams takes forever to join a server and when you do and die you are stuck in a queue re spawn time the deus done even have their own server to test their patches on they rely on us to test the game out very disappointing game use to be fun when you do finally get into a game your at the end of a match and spawn in to tons of tanks spawn camping your caps game went to complete
super addictive game that satisfies my need to play progression based games some may consider is super grind but it is not a game you have to babysit two hundred and forty seven necessarily going free play is entirely viable but i will not deny that spending money gives a huge advantage luckily there is only one player versus player element in the game that this can really effect May
early access review the game should not be released to the public everything is wrong the escape key only opens the main menu and wont close anything or skip the cut scenes quest are barely tracked and the user interface is one of the worst graphics are comparable to run escape but worst the controls are awful there are no parties so staying grouped with friends is difficult i cant name one thing i enjoyed the controls are awful your camera just snaps all over the place overall controls game play graphics i sound ten
this review is totally honest i spent hours upon hours on this game it was a horrific and quite a sad journey to reach the not bad skill bracket everything in this game from the toxic community to the rage i have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did after the fifteen hundreds hours i questioned myself what did i do this for the fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that i chose to play ten hours of data two before my exam the result was an a grade which is not bad is it could it be that i watched to and to and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions whatever the reason my family despised me for what i had become in short data two is a game which is not free to play it requires you to sell your soul to the devil valve and leave your current life for you to become a legend
one thing you need to know is perhaps in eight hundred of the one thousands rooms absolutely nothing is happening once you realize that the game completely loses its horror thus while in the beginning i was nervous that faded away and the game became simply boring and tedious while i can see how many people sincerely enjoy this game unfortunately i have to say that i feel more like it wasted my time with me waiting for something cool to happen
early access review its twenty sixteen now after the dec update and arrival of new space ships this game is now one hundred enjoyable sure never going to regret buying this game not after the epic battles sure going to be in it will make you feel good in both victory or lose one thousand and ten nice job deus
unbelievably unbalanced some cards are game breaking and some decks are way too overpowered without any decent ban list to balance things not to mention that its clearly pay two win but its a free to play mobile game so that kinda expected
i had to write a review about this game because i have noticed the amount of this game has been getting lately and with over one thousand hours i feel as if i am more than qualified to do so yes war thunder is not a perfect game gasp and i too have had my fair share of frustration at times but when i sit back after a match and think about what i did wrong after being completely on nine times out of ten it was my fault not angling my arm or properly being impatient and pushing so far up i get surrounded it center that what i love about this game when you screw up its on you people are quick to cry wolf on the russian bias those people are also the ones who done angle flank and mindlessly take on a heavy tank from the front this game requires a plethora of skill which you will eventually require through practice and perseverance learn your tank lane know your weaknesses and your strengths this will help you tremendously in any situation if instant gratification is something you are looking for there always cod foreigner does a wonderful job updating the game fairly fast and you can see they really do care about their community they keep us updated and add new content almost every other month they also do an excellent job hyping the following updates giving players something to look forward to in the near future cough cough boat basically if you want me to cut the and get straight to the point of this review do not play this game if you are easily angered or impatient you will not survive if you are new to it give it a try for yourself instead of looking at the comments this community really likes to whine done let the comments plague your experience most importantly have fun try not to think too much and ill see you in the skies of
early access review played this game mostly in early access came back to it after a while and it still pretty much sucked sure you could make robots but the matches were always really unfair today i came back to it today i realized how terrible it truly is the crack heads that made this should be shot for ruining such a game that could be wonderful
i came i saw i clicked not necessarily in that order in all seriousness the game is a simple anime clicker click to damage the monster girl on the screen and gain gold at their defeat its an of time waster for the hardcore anime fan but nothing to write home about live gotten to the point where upgrading costs trillions so pacing has gotten quite slow for a free game its of not gonna win any awards but then again i done think that was ever the case still worth a recommend if just barely
product received for free early access review installed this game in twenty fourteen and have been addicted to it a play time however the game became less and less of what i joined it for build drive fight the removal of tiers seemed like a forced decision to keep queue times low and led to a huge amount of sea clubbing which was fixed by successively breaking the game more and more veteran players have been screwed over by free am time after time to me the most significant break with old players was when megabits were removed a few hundreds of hours of playtime were completely wasted not counting the hours needed to build the bot the last epic loot update which replaced the currency based economy with a random crate reward and ridiculously increased prices of everything added the last bit that was needed for me to remove the game i waited for the state of the game update today and since it does not look like free am is willing to change their game back to what i and many others too liked in out good game free am
i still remember those innocent days in which i played cookie clicker and clicker hero never would i have imagined myself to reach a lower point in my life i wonder to this day what i had done wrong in my life to get to this point of playing laura clicker for hours non stop
game is just average it feels like a combination of arch age and black desert online but stripped of any engaging content or fun live spent all my time doing lame story quests with average voice acting or killing hundreds of mobs the only thing i really like about the game is the mount animations and your character tilting when you turn while moving both the first person shooter counters from steam and before say the game is running at sixty frames per second and the world feels smooth but it feels like the movement animations were created at thirty frames per second not sure if in going to keep playing bless this game has strangely made me want to go play go again
played this a ton late last year ton of fun decided to come back and give it another shot classes for credits only nope not happening trove going the way of arch age two great games destroyed by the same greedy publisher
one of the best most in depth game i have ever played the graphics are incredible especially when you crank the resolution all the way up and super sample at a boobs boobs would play again
early access review think eternal should exist because people have different tastes in life having said that i done really support the old scheme of resource draw a a a lands or vigils in this game the concept of mana flood screw is a problem that shouldn't exist the way eternal manages mulligan is clever but not enough even if you vomit your resource theory it doesn't matter how pro you are if luck just screws you on the other side i have to say that eternal had the best free play scheme however like any other collectible card game whilst expansions start to hoard new players will have an increasingly difficult time to build a collection no matter how generous the game it was in the beginning if it doesn't scale with the increased card pool at some point you start drafting the same cards over and over so you end with little to none value even if they give it to you so as a final verdict i stopped playing eternal mainly because mana flood screws it became expensive in time to farm resources the return value is pathetic and balance can be tricky sometimes however i done think it is bad at all if you are mtg fanboy you should give it a try otherwise run from here and try something else to avoid wasting your time
god game with good voice track that could stimulate your five senses to peak performance not to mention great seductive art that helps to improve your finger clicking skills five hundred that enable you to finger to any girls heart say good bye to solo life hello to chick magnet achievement unlocked
early access review overall i would recommend this game i am a girl who does not game often but when i do i like to play games that have some sort of strategy ability to alter your appearance and a time limit i get bored doing quests and building up levels for what who knows this game however has a few fun aspects one there is a time limit you are dropped in remote locations to gather weapons and loot while ymir a blue cold frost spreads if you get caught in the cold it harms your health this is a quick achievable goal that tests your skill when you get caught up such as in a vehicle am used in town by an opposing team players in the game in teams of twelve and forty two there are three ways to quickly transport in game zip lines hand gliders and snowboards giving each game its own unique round a different strategic approach your appearance is somewhat custom table with various outfits and makeup to choose from i admit i change my outfit before every game you can carry multiple weapons from snipers to shotguns are and sags with multiple scope attachments the loading time int that long live waited maybe three minutes tops just enough time to go get a snack or run to the bathroom the end goal is to board a helicopter before the whole places freezes and its fun at the end i end up screaming in entertainment even if i done win it is winnable things i would change one ability to shoot when downed waiting to be revive sensitivity on scopes and camera in general i took mine down to one thousand five hundred and twenty and prefer it over the preset five hundred and three the snow seen makes its really easy to spot people but there are just enough rocks trees and hiding spots to get to the end of game upgraded vests and helmets sometimes they protect me sometimes i am like i shot this guy in the head three times and he kills me with one shot from a pistol awe hello nah huh overall recommend yes
its a very slow burn of a game but in not sure if there actual payoff after three hundred rooms it just felt like this was a hallway simulator with a rare jump scare you would think with a name like house of jump scares that it would have too many but no it doesn't really have too much of anything except hallways kudos on the horror pop culture references but in not sure who this game is for its too cute to be spooky and too dark to be cute
early access review shoots enemy with sub machine gun lands three hit shoots enemy with shot gun lands four hit enemy runs up to me and hits me once with a knife die instantly one thousand and ten great realism
live been playing data two since december twenty elevens and i really like most of the aspects of this game data two is great for players who aim for competitive gaming but is equally good for casual gamers who play for the sole purpose of enjoyment one of the features of data two which i like the most is its ever evolving meta game play which changes from time to time just when a think you've figured out the meta a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explore learn and adapt to the changes this changing met game not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the professional scene a champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams the beauty of the game lies in its ever evolving nature the more a learn about it the more a fall in love with it recommended for all gamers who have a thing for strategy games or want to try out data two because of its huge community December

early access review for this game being in alpha it int that bad i would recommend this to anyone who likes space games and it is fully compatible with the steam controller which works great
early access review for the six hours i played nonstop mind you i have to give this game a lot of credit a friend bought this for me after telling me about it and i was a bit iffy on the idea of another sandbox game similar to min craft but there is a lot of differences between the two games the structure of the game itself gives a whole new feel if you are use to playing min craft its not as easy as chop some wood mine some stone then you re good to go there is a lot of depth to just the crafting alone while it is still fairly easy to find all the resources you need you need a lot of them even after you collect them you might need to use some tools to break it down into a different material for example breaking vines down into twine yes you have wait times on crafting stuff while it int too terribly bad the times do get a bit longer as you start using more advanced materials such as obsidian iron and diamonds but in my opinion it adds more to the game because now you have to wait five minutes to advance and in that time you could go out and collect more resources or even go spelunking the creatures in the game is definitely unique while some do remind me of creatures from jan and baxter the night piss and night leafs they still have a unique vibe to them and they of course vary in difficulty while a few of them have unique skills such as blinding you for a short time or spinning to do a lot of damage there int a lot to worry about as long as you keep some distance also there is furniture and to be honest it actually looks pretty nice there is also a lot of ways to customize and build your own house and make it stand out from your friends you have different types of carpet walls and even slanted roof planks you can craft you even have different coloured lamps you could use them like my friend does and make each room different color though the blue sometimes confuses me because i never know if it is dark out or not but it still looks really nice much like a room with a bunch of black lights to add on to the crafting idea to the game you do not start off with being able to craft everything in the game you have to work your way up and find the recipes while some of them are scattered in chests around the world you usually unlock new ones after you craft something else like weapons for instance after you craft a wood sword you unlock the crafting recipe for a stone sword which means you have to work to find better things meaning you actually have a goal to work towards while there is still some bugs in the game with it being early access it still runs fairly smooth and its easy to play with friends no port forwarding or setting up custom servers simply create a world and set a password so your friends can join up even when you are offline they can still join the world and continue which to me is pretty awesome i would gladly recommend this game to anyone who likes min craft or sandbox games in general and i think if you actually take some time with this game you'll find there is a lot of possibilities with it
early access review would be a great game if not for the fact that the prebuilt decks have a horrible habit of drawing either all vigils or all summoning cards nearly every time i play against a real person only way you re going to win is if you get a balance of half vigils and half low level summoning cards or pay out the
early access review be me looking on the free to play list because i have no money in sees this trailer looks good downloads sees that reviews are mixed sees comment shotgun with the range of a sniper wonders what i got into game done downloading in like half a second goes into game tab to check the scoreboard looks on menu and figures out there no way to look at your ping goes to options and then graphics has thirty five options quits from poor hit detection am now here old done download its so bad right now still in early access maybe it shall get better later
imagine this the perfect game a flight sim paradise with a mix of arcade fun where you can fly multiple planes imagine this game also had tanks tanks that players use imagine you being able to go between a plane and a tank sounds great right now imagine that the deus behind this game completely not care about the community flight models broken in every patch planes being crippled world war two planes matched against korea era jets and now sprinkle a bit of deus decide what you play and how you have fun then stick a big stinking huge grind to get anywhere on top a game where the deus force you to play specific races penalize you for doing good in planes and utilizing them as they should and then force you to pay money to lessen the grind a grind which increases with every patch they release done forget the fact that they keep lessening the value of everything in game and raising the prices for less reward whats that want a pack with a premium plane sure say the deus but well charge you twice as much turn two months of premium into two weeks and completely over the premium plane as well that is war thunder where the deus have opted to cash in and lose their player base
had to edit this review fair warning it was originally a negative not because of game play glitches or the development team it was because of the lack of players i want to tell you this game is amazingly addictive it i hope that its community expands because even if the player base is small i still wait to play another match its that good graphics are impressive yet the game system is optimized so well its not clunky to play on the gym six hundred and fifty this is something a lot of early access games struggle to do and the fractured space team has achieved it with what seems so easy
great game constant free content updates that change a lot of game mechanics every three months there are new unique build enabling items developers care about the game and fix bugs every time they pop up couldn't recommend this game enough
meh not very well made clicker game while i do like the art and upgrade system overall it looks like it was made by a student no full screen and it gets slightly saggy when you click really fast not even talking about clickers waited for a minute for it to become responsive again
well as this game sits open on my desktop i write this i was gifted this game from a friend in brazil when you still had to pay fifteen to get it so he payed for it so that i could have it well according to certain restrictions i could never play it that want the developers fault but when they made the game free play on steam i felt kind of bad that my friend payed for it and i couldn't play it that was a redundant story but its how i got where i am the game constantly popped up in my recommended list and today i finally decided i will try this game it has good reviews and i mean it was free after all installation was very quick but it all fell apart after that i opened the game for the first time and i had to enter my date of birth to accept the eula a total of twenty three times yes i counted it never ended up working so i closed the game to restart it seeing if that fixed my problem well that did fix my problem it brought me directly to what i assume is the main page however even though the game says single player on the steam store page it wouldn't let me do anything from the main menu i was brought to the fax and change logs and the a button closed my screen i tried clicking the free recipe button several times but all it did was shake rattle vibrate and intimidate me with failure i closed the came once more to attempt to restart and i got the same problem i took my time to move my window around the screen in order to read the rest of what was scrawled at the bottom of the window as the game launched with some strange resolution that was blocked by my windows overlay and where i was getting at before with the stem store says it has single player it said the creatives servers were down and i could not play so i closed the game and went and did something else for about ten minutes i returned and said third time is the charm so i opened the game this time it approached me with the eula agreement once more i filled out my info and it drug me to character creation and after a long drawn out process to start i eventually was able to start to enjoy the game and honestly despite the bad first impressions the insanely loud audio and the strange resolution the game is pretty nice once you figure out how to fix those problems
wow this game has really caught me where i am most vulnerable the nostalgia everything in this game reminds me of the good old rugs like risen gothic it center from the music to the graphics its just perfect good nostalgia the game play is really fluid and good all the classes seem balanced dungeons are randomly generated i could go on like this forever but the biggest point of interest for me and maybe you as well is the fact that micro transactions are almost entirely cosmetic and the game never really throws them into your face like a lot of other free to play games tend to do if you decide not to buy anything from the shop it doesn't really hinder your progress at all and you can still continue on without noticing any difference
early access review refunded after four hours not because of the typical massively multiplayer online launch problems like downtime and server la instability but because of the god awful performance and the terrible google translate translations thought i could get past those things seeing as its early access but its a bigger deal to me than i previously thought might wait for it to go free to play as the game itself int terrible its really no surprise it failed in so many other markets before the western a launch deus just seem incompetent two year old problems are still present in this version of the game and i really done ever expect to see those issues fixed spend your four thousand and thirty elsewhere and just save your time with this piece of trash only thing this game brings to the table is a new open uninstalled world that about it
after a very long time of taking off from this game i wanted to give it a shot again the game refuses to run literally does nothing after playing play in the launcher in just to tired to try to fix it on my own this game always had faulty client even before steam release i convinced all of my friends to forget about the client issue as each and every single one of them faced a different problem diagnosed all of them back then when the support team gave me the automated message right now i feel too old and tired to fix it ill delete it before giving it a try such a shame
early access review every update they didst listen and they removed everything what made this game different from the rest its total trash now done bother trying it out its in its last breath
early access review an interesting game to say the least the lack of a us server doesn't bother me much the biggest and most terrible issue is actually that the game doesn't fully shut down through steam some background task or something i done know either way going through task manager and processes and programs whatever i cannot find this foreign process to close down in order for steam to say the game is not running any more hence why in uninstalling the game after so many hours and force ending steam bootstrap just so i can update my personal computer good game not so grind at low levels didst make it past lvi thirty so but yeah seems fun flying right off the bat is nice too since the first available dragon has wings laugh out loud taming is a simple reverse direction game kinda like reverse sumo wrestling a the distinction between taxable dragons and unable is not apparent think someone who is good at it should be able to tame just about anything quick bar could use the ability to be changed from default keys to custom cum pad keys would be great also as far as changing keys maybe being able to set look to arrow keys instead of mouse would be nice but the greatest problem is the inability of the game to end for steam without ending steam itself
early access review this game took a direction you are not even able to play duos anymore this is literally the worst duo game experience i have ever had i honestly regret giving this game a chance and i cannot recommend this game to anyone if you are looking to play with your friends and if you done have friends then this game is great
product received for free early access review very good game much like call of duty but still a lot of skill involved if this game keeps updating and getting better this could be a big game
brilliant fun game to play very immersive the game is free to play but of course with limitations you can get around not paying a penny so long as you do the missions but this method will be very time consuming in happy to support the deus on this game they have provided an enjoyable game and deserve to be paid its a hard game and you can walk around without seeing a thing animals will scatter before you even get a glimpse of them they smell you coming from a mile away and tracking an animal for hours on end may sound tedious but it makes for a very enjoyable experience its not a game for everyone but id say at least give the game a try may
the best game in existence most exhilarating game play you will ever experience real life pales in comparison to this game the single player offline campaign has the best story ever the graphics are amazing way ahead of its time and i love how you can eventually unlock time travel and this opens up whole new possibilities for solving puzzles and the weapon customisation is so in depth that you can even decide what band of screw is used and what metal is used for production and the moment when you get to ride an alpha is amazing definitely play this game and nothing else ever again
data two is a multiplayer online battle arena game from valve data two is the next instalment from the previous game or mods data data two has the same game play as data you pick your heroes and then battle them in one map against another player in the arena as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena you need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not data two introduce item drops each time you finish a match online there are many items in data two that can enhance your favourite heroes looks each item has rarity the more rare the items the more expensive it will become most items can be sold in the steam marketplace data two has far improved graphics from the previous game heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view all heroes ability effects are also improved even the user interface is better data two has many tournaments that you can participate the biggest is the international data two tournament most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments data two is the best mob game yet i recommend this rating nine hundred and ten
i love this game i used to not until i bought a membership people give this a bad review cause it says free to play but you need a membership people just need to stop being so cheap and buy a membership then write a review cause this is a really good game
its good most of the time many buggy bits though it doesn't tell you some important thing i recommend it but done get to exited its not the best game live seen but its far from the worst
good game with lots of room for improvement fractured space is a five versus five multiplayer shooter on mob style maps its fun its easy to pick up and its definitely worth it for a free game progression through the game is fairly easy and not heavily favoured towards players who pay and the deus are busy at work fixing stuff and adding new content pros option of player versus player ave coop or single player good ship balancing the deus actually listens to players and nerf the overpowered weapons quite a few pal playing find a game in under two minutes player base int five combat with three axis of movement is surprisingly fluid cons one map design have so little variety game play sometime is over reliant on accuracy this int counter strike go in game purchases can get you overpowered crew and buffs not exactly pm hard to turn the tide once you start losing
a very fun game absolutely worth the time you'll spend playing it to top that off its free and though you'll begin very slowly giving soldiers me kits and collecting broken arrows the moment you expect a chore you re fighting the necromancers chief in brute strength from there you can do anything you so choose whether that be the plot line or discovering things you a rent supposed to yet every class and race feels individual as some races change the load out of your class it runs off the familiar stats from and strength dexterity charisma constitution wisdom these stats will effect anything you do this game requires skill rather than good equipment unlike wow in that you can sidestep and teleport depending on your class to escape attacks you have to have full situational awareness though because if one enemy can sneak up on you you re gonna have a bad time you can quest with other people which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than other morphs there is even a mail system and though some quests you do feel similar you wont get bored of them they never feel repetitive although they sound like it bottom line is if you have hard drive space good internet and need something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year this game is definitely for you
early access review after playing footnote for around five months i have become completely bored with the game after hearing about this new game called realm royal i decided to download it i was pleasantly surprised just how much of a breathe of fresh air this game is to the battle royal genre it combines elements of mobs and rugs with battle royal and i absolutely love it
early access review say that this is a must own for horror fans why you may ask well one its freed if it well be later tho two its a well made game three its fun to play and that all i can say for now want to see more play it for you re self and find out eight thousand five hundred and ten must own May
it is what it is a gun simulator literally cool idea well designed and the graphics are a solid game play if you want to call it that is taking a gun apart and putting it back together you can zoom in and out to get those little pieces further inside the gun level of detail while zooming is quite impressive but i feel unless you are a real serious gun enthusiast this might not be for you but for what it is it is quite impressive and well done done take my word for it and check out my video by clicking on the link tips wow youtube co watch tax canon
i have only played this game for a few days but it is very well done and well worth trying there are some micro transactions but that seams to be the way that these card games are going great story line so far though
first things first this is no arcade racer its a racing simulator that means its content is more geared laugh out loud towards reality racing now i done understand why a lot of people would say any game is broken when the problem is their hardware the only reason i could see fit to complain would be if the deus make changes to the games system requirements that make it so you can no longer play the game without spending more money on new hardware this is made worse if the game is an upfront paid for game to begin with demos are excluded if the game stops working on my system i know that as long as i have all the files downloaded no missing or corrupted files that something within my system has changed not the game laugh out loud especially if others are able to still run the game really come now why would you even fix you thoughts to blame the game if you yourself have it running on another system within your own home not to mention that your friends are not having any of your issues why are you so unlucky so the game is just bad for everyone else also in thumbing up for this game of yeah wait pay to win its free now with eleven cars and four tracks it was like that from what i remember i just recently found this out a few days ago myself double thumbing now pay to win with a game that free to start playing live looked around the game and found the platinum pack deal while it could be better priced of and doable though i haven bought it yet everything is included in the pack now your free to start playing so called pay to two win game can be just a paid for game with full content so yes in wanting to buy the game in just saying all this limo i think that what makes a pay to win game is when getting certain paid content delivers a big advantage over free to play players and when that certain paid content is unreasonably expensive but once again this all mop good job sector three studios main studios
if you enjoy magic this game is very similar with some nice twists that are fun the game is very generous about giving cards to the play more so then any other online card games live played the tutorial is a little long and kinda boring is my only crit ism so stick with it and make it through the tutorial and you will most likely enjoy the game
early access review so i got this game when it first came out i played a bit and then i left it but now i have come back and wow its gone from strength to strength i love playing it and i cant get enough of it and to top it all off its free two play now so people have no reason not to try it out so if you are reading this then hit that download button now as this is one game you done want to miss out on
its pretty decent probably the best world war two game on steam atm well mine anyway and its not pay to win i got decent gear just grinding which i had to anyway to unlock the better guns and i had fun doing so and that another thing i see a lot of people complaining about how it can be a grind fest but if there was no grind then whf is there to do
early access review played it and got stuck on the bless logo screen permanently took me almost an hour of messing around to get it working i did the in game tutorial tried to kill some orcs and it crashed apparently this game was released in the east almost five years ago and has been tanking there due to very basic mechanics and user interface being complete trash would again
fun game play very entertaining in the beginning but very slow during the endgame unfortunately you have to rely on the chest based lottery for late game blueprints and sadly its hard to get chests and keys without spending cash for gems
recommending this game as i am experiencing a lot of enjoyment playing it it is a free to play game which offers so much it is continually evolving and the developers update the game frequently it plays well and it has no pay to win loot boxes my personal favourite of this genre it just keeps on getting better and bigger
the game surprisingly has many layers there of course the spam when you first log in the people trying to pedal you items for real money all of which you will eventually lose which is actually one of the things i like about this game you re going to die otherwise what would be the point of those leader boards you done want to die too bad oryx says you have to the first time i logged on was when the entire server was being ported to oryx castle and needless to say i died instantly i just laughed at myself a bit afterwards and stopped playing for a while but picked it back up anyways when a friend i had introduced to the game wanted me to it still held that first aspect but my friend opened my eyes to the more i will say mag side of it for lack of a better adjective it gets very fun yet frustrating at times especially when that character you got really lucky on suddenly dies because you lagged while fighting a big boss
early access review loved playing this game recommended it to all my friends even with adding the unbalanced weapons i stuck with it but these lame loot crates are where i draw the line you've made it impossible for people to customize the bots the way they want if they sell the blocks you give them which i done blame them being mostly inner and random shields you lose half your merger profits from even a good match seriously sixty random blocks and a number five shield from a platinum crate level one hundred and five battle arena victory totals maybe ten million one thousand five hundred robots which is a tenth or less of the old rewards after conversion
early access review the art style is not really my favourite but the game has a good base and enjoyable game play very much like magic the gathering mixed with hearthstone my biggest complaint would be the lack of ramp cards and the fact you cannot have less than thirteen power cards in your decks over all super fun hope it gains popularity
edit i hear they are getting rid of the pay to win play but until i see it gone my review will stay if it goes back to the old rob craft it will change i got this game when it first came out and i thought it was good for a couple updates then it went down hill fast i quit playing this for one twelve years due to the unhelpful game improving updates i tried it again today may twenty three two thousand and fifteen found out it got worse it went from a free to play somewhat equal with the option to play to might as well pay to today where the only way i can see how you can really improve anymore is pay to get any good weapons you have to pay everything is overhauled the currency the object naming system its now reminiscent of steiner tractor co only more confusing and no good or bad the announcers sound almost exactly like team fortress two done drag them into this mess and run from this game in all if you could get a version from one year ago get it this version no edit i do see steam does say this game is mostly negative with in the last thirty days no surprise there in surprised there int a overall negative rating May

early access review bad game game is one hundred pay to win tanks are overpowered teams are always going to be unbalanced runs the only defence to tanks to rocket launchers but to be able to afford one would be easily thirty hours of grinding for money leaving you with guns you have to repair your attachments for some stupid reason i already paid a ton of money to buy a gun and now i have to in maintain them three hundred and ten would not re download of graphics terrible spawns
overall impressions be been told that this game is great from launch and time and time again from post hype patches between getting blasted from a line of fire to heal another soldier in battle and getting spawn killed from a sundered to jump into battles my poor experience from the game has yet to mature into something great i will admit planet side two has a lot of content to cover in the first couple of hours there just so much to learn on top of the fact that everyone seems to know what they re doing but as for scrawny me i didst know about the training area until four hours in and i clearly done quite recall on the amount of depth the game had to offer between character weapon and vehicle customization from the trailers not only do you as a character get to customize the kinds of weapons you would like in terms of a play style but each of these load outs contain a perk that you can choose to add on along with other smaller a dons onto your vehicle in addition the weapons you equip and their inner machinations are something you can choose to change these changes a rent for nought of course they do in fact change the game that said if you re a player who wants to jump in and get a fun engagement within the span of fifteen minutes like most korean free to play shooters this is not for you spawn times feel slow and deliberate even if it is only fifteen seconds instant action consistently warps you into different locations and done even get me started ont travelling between each zone when stalemate hit on a heavy day these battles last longer than a typical infantry only match in battlefield three you have to do your research on the game as i mentioned earlier i didst play very well in certain that is a primary result of it if you want to play well in the game there certainly the whole aiming and shooting aspect of it but there a lot more than just that and many of the players account for this whilst being in the battle all of that in mind if you know you want to put a lot of time into not being productive this is the game for you

early access review the their system was changed now even in the lowest tier you get destroyed by way to strong way to expensive weapons saving to get them is basically not possible without a ton of farming not fun at all anymore
to begin with you'll be hooked i was from july last year to jan this year then you realise your still farming the same enemy in the endgame as the ones at day one and their is no real point to it the enemy look different but attack the same theirs about five different types just with tons of remodeler skinned versions on a more positive note the general game play although repetitive and building component is nice and the classes are awesome they add tons of variation to the game although having to farm to get them all want good the community is friendly and trove is really easy to mod i modded the game when i tired of playing it the amount of ring in the game ruins it though a ton of farming needed to progress in the game not much variation in enemy functionality basically point and shoot or point and slash back in july i would have recommended this but then trio noticed they haunt screwed the trove player base over yet i wouldn't recommend getting this its a waste of time July
early access reviewing played this game for ninety even hours as a paladin the class that has the lowest dps which sucks when trying to level can you say boring live clubbed everyone to death for four hundred and fifteen levels there is a story to the game but after level twenty five you enter into the player versus player zones that is where tools much higher than you dwell and try to kill you the moment you step up to a quest giver to say i have no clue what the story is at this point is an understatement what is it like to level a paladin at level forty one well live killed three thousands mobs and performed twenty five questions in only half way to level i am so bored of this game the only way ill keep playing is if the deus make me fort fifth level us if level fort one is any indication ill have to kill another seventeen thousand mobs and perform one hundred and ninety quests to hit forty five just not worth it you want to know what is in and not in the game read the six thousand reviews want a fun game this one is not it players are leaving this game
i played combat arms since two thousand and eight since i started playing heroes generals i haven even logged on to a this game is the best war game live ever played i love this game if you've never played this game you need to check it out you will love it my hat goes off to the guys that make this possible the detail is awesome i wish i could play this game two hundred and forty seven but i have to work during the week that how much i love this game look how many hours live racked up and so fast live only been playing this game a few months play heroes generals you'll be glad you did look on youtube for videos that will teach you about the game also check the forums there is also a channel on team speak three there you can join a clan and get to know some people who have played the game a long time and know the in and outs of the game you will learn a lot from these guys i hope this review will help have a good one
org my waif is in this game anime var loo apollo share two facebook about els word success pay two win goodness classic at its max other words i cant stand anime nor this game each too hawaii
early access review game felt a little slow at the beginning tbs this will be a short review content missing not enough classes yes its early access but a lot feels wrong simple didst live up to the expect ions or felt like it was a good enough game graphics felt like they were from an older version of xiv
really good game combines tactics with shooting and cooperating with your teammates buy it if you want to spend time flying around and shooting or if you have friends to make a squad and play together the second one feels amazing
the elder scrolls legends is a game based on the universe of the famous saga the elder scrolls after playing more than five hundred hours game mostly on android i can say that it is a wonderful game with multiple game modes history mind busting ranked arena casual has a new attractive interface good dynamics of games different types of decks and creating them from a fun to the most strategic the community is very close you can advance in various ways to get cards and decks you can farming gold or buy it with real money at no time the game forces you to spend it is up to you how to play and get the items
battlefield four conquest very large scale maps never ending combat kinda slightly pay to win but you can mostly avoid paying if you are skilled enough or if you are playing with a group of friends try it and done rage quit when you get killed for the one hundredth time in a row this game is not easy watch some guides online
very poor driving experience the game is he but the graphics done excel the menu is very hard and amazed up as an actual in game footage on every challenge you are allowed to control your car after three seconds on which if you continuously press the acceleration button you will lose control of your car immediately no to mention that every time you are forced to start the game on a curve there are three difficulties that you can chose before you enter a race once you are in it you cannot adjust them novice the one that the artificial intelligence breaks like your grandma normal the decent way to play this games and advanced unplayable from keyboard few tracks few cars you are forced to play a specific car on a specific race the game looks of from the outside but its not northing the time waiting to install cheers predator
this game is pretty good its basically all those popular vowel games put together to make a good game overview so when you first launch up the game you make your account which is pretty easy so i done mind that and then you make your character the character creation is nice with a couple hair styles and lots of color to choose for anything really so after creating your character you get put into your own world this is basically the tutorial section of the game this little cube named of is basically your navy he al is the and they'll help you along in all your adventures after you get through the tutorial section of the game you can start doing stuff by your own there int really an end to the game unless you count the end as collecting all items which is yeah you know the game play is really fun too the combat feels balanced and the building is pretty polished for the time its been out this game is really fun especially if you have friends who play too you can make worlds together and stuff old creatives is a vowel game which is very polished and really fun
early access review beautiful game with much thought put into it ten outta ten if you ask me if terra ria was three dimensional and had children with min craft this would be it pros unique pamela interesting crafting cons very very small amount of ore you will not get out of this game for approximately twenty a cause it took me that much to get best arm or
this game is really an underrated work of greatness the space graphics are completely out of this world tee he the game play is smooth and requires teamwork to really win the game but does deter solo players from enjoying the arena style combat on their own the developers continuously update this game with ships skins and balancing frequently you wont regret trying this out hell drag a friend with you for two times the fun and eight times the rage when he doesn't pick a support ship jake we already have three attackers and in already tanking go support one hundred and seventeen would dock with other dudes in space again
this game was nothing like i thought it was gonna be i thought this game was gonna at least feel a little bit realistic this game just feels awful to play the character movements are clunky and the shooting is awful any character can shoot pretty much anywhere and the controls are horrible i can literally shoots with big center

garbage wrapped in pretty color the game to satisfy gamers who like to grind for goods but not really do anything but waste time its beta so be ready for false representation of awards and nonstop in game popups selling rubies of joy
god damn have the mighty have fallen i had started this game around december of two thousand and fourteen and it seemed interesting the previous year came and gone without much issues with the updates but then this year rolled around and it looks like the game is under new management i did not mind the removal of tech points nor the addition of new weapons but the straw that broke the camels back is one important thing nan disruptor loss of damage output to enemies and therefore its fall to complete uselessness if you can heal yourself by just waiting why have someone on your team with just nan disruptor when you can just hide somewhere and regenerate the addition of lock on weapons seemed like a good idea on paper but it makes taking them on a nightmare when you consider that the new loot system has a good probability to reward these weapons you should never ever ever have loot drops be the sole way to earn curacy and items and more importantly never have the ring be too damn broad with the drops as another reviewer has pointed out it does not matter if you bought crates odds are that all the drops will be common or uncommon ninety of the time i had to deal with crypt arch school in destiny year one and he was more fair with his drops even before bungee fixed his rolls with engrams than with this new bullshit loot system and what the hell is up with the locked drops behind slots deal we got them out of those crates give them to us done you dare shove a cupcake in our face and then take it away because we done have the lecce cary requirements considering these items are going to be hard as hell to get now with the new currency situation with the drop system in place you have to break down items just so then you can make new ones overall great in job with screwing over year long fans who enjoyed the game and great job in over people who would gladly give you money with this backwater money gouging system you suck because you made a once good game suck thank god for jim sterling update ten wow you guys really edit up i came back hoping that the game might just might have changed for the better but no it got worse first of all i see the loot box system hast changed didst even bother giving those who suffered through the last year of this show a day of premium just to earn all of the rewards no and while i will admit giving players almost an unlimited size just that in order to play player versus player it has to be under two thousands cup the fact that getting blocks to build your bot with is still a chore makes it underwhelming and is it just me or is the weight of your bot is put on the back left as opposed to the center where it should be this cant be a counter to drones as most bots are supposed to built from the center outwards it would make no sense to change that also i miss the the single player mode where you could kill bots and get rewarded for it what think that people were abusing it its actually laughable on how at release it has less players then when it went to alpha then again it has been a year and a half since i wrote this review and you've done buggered it up some more clearly all are deaf to your audience and you should be ashamed for it dEcember
early access review if you think footnote is bad because of the building then this is for you its still in early alpha but its improving a lot so give it a goo its only a but as a person loving a in pub area three its not that bad to play it in a unlike footnote
at first the game will see like fun but then you realize the community seems to be non existed all armour looks the same and it feels like a bare bones theme park which it is at least the character creator is nice but i hate the over detailed arm or and weapons that they give us
edit i have tried getting into it again and i still see the problems listed here it is also a fact that i hate free to play games for it is often it is pay to win done let steams game time fool all live played this game since nov two thousand and thirteen daily i got the game directly off does page when i first tried it i felt confused in a good way and it was fun hundreds of people on foot in tanks in transport trucks called sufferers and in fighters then after twenty three months i felt like i was repeating yesterday over and over the first impressions the game left on me vanished i decided to stay however seeing i invested time and money but then a few months later i noticed a decline in player activity something i honestly expected it dropped to mere a continent having fewer them fifty people on it at that point i felt like people left because of lack of content lack of instructions or lack of invitation i then decided to quit my membership and leave the game all together now onto the pros and the cons pros a lot of weapons and tools to use a lot of so called outfits that are player groups a good mix of land and air vehicles to pilot big battlegrounds to exchange fire servers for different time zones cons cosmetics and membership are overpriced weapons with in game currency are overpriced requires a high grade personal computer to run at decent settings poor tutorial level poor in game mic chat possible unexpected game crashes newer players can mess up a base captured stats all i was able to think of this game int good i give it a four hundred and ten
this is my first ever steam review and its for one of the best games ever live had tried getting into other mob games but simply count i gave smite a chance because of the unique gods theme and the playing camera angle and in glad i did the game environment is absolutely chilling and addicting all those gods and the powers make you wanna play it two hundred and forty seven definitely recommended
early access review the draws in this game are just insane almost every game you either draw all power cards or the opponent has answers for everything you play i understand decks are supposed to be able to control the board but when you draw seven power cards in a row while the opponents are at five he and end up losing the game because they can kill your units the rest of the game it just takes away every bit of fun or interest
since they never send you the registration email you can never play and there is no way to ask it to resend the registration email so done wast your hard drive space on this dud
early access review not really sure what happened to this game i started playing about a little over a year ago and everything made sense the economy the way the bots where divided into tiers the construction process was great one of my favourite aspects of the game was trying to find more effective ways to build robots i just tried to play it and everything has completely changed there is no more stratification in the arm or its unclear to me at least how the matchmaking system works the whole tech tree seems to have disappeared the pilot seat is gone whats the point in thinking about where your blocks go if there is nothing vulnerable its still fun to drive around and blow up other peoples bots but the game seriously lacks the elements that got me really into it in the first place
early access review horrendous done bother thirty four releases and they didst learn jack from their previous failure stay away from this game its not worth it you re in for a very big fat disappointment if you buy this game
its like eating a juicy dirty burger except better therefore i recommend this game period of plus solo arena and upcoming in game tournaments you done get that in burgers very often on a serious note your hearthstone playing skills brain data can be transferred over to this game nice of the developers to incorporate that feature update the july seventeen after the release of heroes of sky rim and thirty hours into the game been playing a lot of solo arena and some ranked matches i have already started to lose interest in the game and getting bored more often it just docent have that fun factor that i get with hearthstone with hearthstone i get plenty of good laughs which makes it a happy game where as legends just feels dark and somewhat sad i tried to like this game hopefully leaving hearthstone behind after three years but it just docent quite make the cut done get me wrong its a decent game i recommend i enjoyed the first few hours due to the excitement of a new card game but its just not appealing enough for a hearthstone veteran like me not that juicy dirty burger i thought it would be July
done let people turn you away from this game if you really like to race it is a very good simulation but there are some that would say otherwise due to not taking the time to get to know the physics model and the fact that the gas pedal has more positions than just nothing to floored now that not to say that this game doesn't have flaws after all what games these days done have a flaw here and there the only big flaw for me is that the artificial intelligence has vastly superior grip to the player but you can get close with the right amount of tuning and the deus are working on fixing that issue right now online races in this game are a real blast in get real mode but first i beg you to log practice time in this mode based on the multiplayer races i have seen lately people think that get real mode is going to be like driving a normal car in real life now the problem with that kind of thinking is that the engines on these cars are made to go much faster than a normal car that you would drive daily so get real mode takes some practice but after you master it it is definitely the best mode another thing the deus might add soon is an offline mode which will be great for unexpected times of internet outage since you would still be able to log some track time if you want in short yes this game has some flaws but so does every other game ever developed so if you really like racing give this a try i mean its free so you've got nothing to lose except a little bit of time if you done like the game but wouldn't you have burned that time gaming anyway
i done usually write reviews for games but felt i had to with planet side two in not particularly good at the game nor do i have an outfit clan to play with which i hear improves the enjoyment of the game however live gotten tons of hours of enjoyment from this game nonetheless the largest things that causes me to keep this game in high regard are one the ability to feel like you re contributing regardless of how skilled you are of course if you are very skilled and have a large squad to coordinate with you'll have a large impact however even alone and even if you a rent getting kills healing others repairing vehicles spotting enemy from afar giving ammo contributing to mass advances it center all help your teammates and done require a large amount of skill the incredible amount of customization and unlocks the amount of things to unlock and advancement is so immense that you will always have something to strive for and gives a constant sense of purpose and achievement the amazing feel of mass warfare large zero swarms of infantry followed by huge player tank conveys and large air battles raging overhead is just extremely fun and just being there as part of it all on foot in a vehicle or in air is just plain awesome and very few if any games offer this experience on this scale its completely free live paid about only five for a little bit of station cash and the only reason i paid that was to support the game you can easily get by without paying a dime and i did until i felt like a criminal getting so much enjoyment without paying anything there have been complaints of pay town and tediousness if you done pay and while there is some of this i done think its completely valid but judge for yourself as its completely free there so much value and so little cost as in zero that its a no trainer to at least try the game out
bad graphics and its not really that fun when there are just a few pal going around trying to kill you its just not that fun when you lose everything cut someone suck up and shot you why do i want to grind for items i just had just to lose them again
going to change my review to positive i love the graphics they are simply the best in the industry this game take skill i mean that not that i have that much but in practising and getting better a little more and more everyday also i think i like the buy as you need model this way you done get a bunch of stuff you done need or want this applies to cars tracks and liveries setting up a controller takes time and patience this is definitely a game for mature individuals not that i am very mature this game is a good teacher also what can i say lola big thank you for the developers get i peter
life traverse is exceptional for forceful shooters hardly a month goes by without new virtual fields springing up and appealing you into some fresh conflict and only a few surely understood redirection make sense of how to oversee dynamic player bases even a year after their hidden release whats more a short time later there team fortress two released in two thousand and seven this class based commendable is so far going strong particularly into its seventh year in view of its vigorous and innovative gathering since game spots one of a kind team fortress two review the entertainment has benefited from different upgrades and made the skip to a permitted to play plan of activity the middle action pits two gatherings of players against each other in a battle to get center move a truck or take an organizer case the objective is always uncommonly clear its the exchange between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting the convenient scout the assailant generous the tireless pro the conspiring specialist the irritating sharpshooter the tricky see the feisty pro the shaky trooper and the fundamentally more risky demo an all have exceptional weapons attributes and limits that supplement each other and strife in bundle ways encounters can vary comprehensively depending upon the match sort and the beautifies of each gathering and this strangeness is dire to tvs longstanding solicitation when you leave the door as a mind boggling with a specialist near to you re a forcing unfriendly constrain yet if a spy hovers around to deceive the specialist and you round the corner on a pro it can all come unwound in a matter of seconds master marksmen can cover expected foe ways however rocket ricocheting warriors have an ability for finding elective courses and raining dangerous going from above you may think you have an also fragile scout dead to rights just to be lurched by a baseball and beat the life out of as you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a quit packaging of your cheerful killer its hard not to chuckle at the sheer grouping of ways you can meet an unfavourable end besides engaging jokes insane outfits and sensational host build up this sprightly tone clearly this inside component has endured for by far most of tvs future so if you quit playing it two or three years earlier and return for a couple matches you'll find things are to a great degree surely understood taking in the ropes and getting the hang of your picked part is still a delightful information and acing pushed frameworks doesn't just make you deadlier it gives you more options for how to approach fight keeping your choices open is still gainful too in light of the way that being versatile with your choice of character can help you refrain from ending up on a disastrously imbalanced squad it is team fortress taking all things into account regardless however there is much that has stayed steady about the inside redirection there have been some noticeable changes consistently and moreover ordinary implements of new weapons and things of the few things available in the online store some can be opened through play while others must be acquired with genuine money from little knickknacks that cost not precisely a dollar to huge packs that cost hundreds there a broad assortment of ways to deal with adjust your experience some of the things offer just a vigorous twist on the entertainments starting now saucy to on snappy you can buy tops shirts shoes and other remedial gear to spruce up like a character from adult swim or wear spooky incidental garments that you can wear just in the midst of halloween or a full moon notwithstanding the likelihood that you done support spending for any of this stuff its diverting to see some visual grouping as you endeavour to light your adversaries on fire the best difference from the redirection beginnings comes in the accommodating mode mann versus machine in it you and a few other human players must maintain a strategic distance from swarms of robot zed incarnations of tvs classes from passing on a bomb to your base the money you pick up from pulverizing robots can be spent on mid organize climbs to your qualities and weaponry which can be essential to accomplishment for sure even on the most easy level the robot armed forces are adequately wild to test the guts of a messy gathering this is a mode where absolutely masterminded weapon choices and defensive frameworks can mean the differentiation among succeeding and attempting endeavour afresh you can play this mode to no end yet you wont be met all requirements to increase exceptional prizes or complete difficulties unless you pay a dollar for a tour of duty ticket notwithstanding the way that it doesn't have the energized oddity of entered play the supportive mode can even now offer satisfaction to those adequately committed to see it through however contention is the honest to goodness draw and the team fortress two gathering can completely be engaged on a couple of servers you might be scolded for unwitting cracks of respectability while on others you might be welcomed with pleasing tips and overcharges you can even demand help on particular servers and be corresponded with another player why ought to willing give you a couple tips through talk the society around team fortress two is a charming one not just for their significant learning of and vitality for the delight yet for their imaginative attempts in arranging new weapons things and maps that have since ended up being a bit of the experience it feels like a gathering of managers without whom the delight may well have dwindled away and gone into obsolete nature years earlier staying imperative even a year after release is extraordinary for an engaged shooter yet heres team fortress two still overflowing after seven years in the business every so often it feels like comparable diversion you could have played back then and at various times it feels like no one will ever extremely nail class based shooter competition the way team fortress two does the experience has created during the time without exchanging off what made it so extraordinary regardless so however your permitted to play choices may have extended altogether in the past couple of years there are few that do it furthermore team fortress all reviews are retrieved from the internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time in my religion this is known as art to but you can call it three wording may
love this sim i know some people say it needs and engine update for better tire modelling and overall performance but the game is very payable for practice and online racing the force feedback settings are great you can get your wheel failed in pretty good give it a try and you will love it cant wait for str update
i have been playing this game since beta and i really do love it i am a fan of these games and a massive elder scrolls fan so i would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of either and more so to those a fan of both
early access review love this game in a still learning some of the more interesting combos and deck styles after tons of time in the game i can play on my phone with my card collection and decks so time spend gaining cards from wins feels good and not wasted you get complicated game play and strategies like mtg but with a smooth and polished client like hearthstone if you enjoy hearthstone or mtg you will enjoy this
great and charming graphics very polished game play charming characters and pc many contents and many things to do you will not be bored for a long time many strategies and lot of possibilities lots of customization for your character cities shop buildings items very addictive at least for the first four hundred and twenty hours make you cannot stop playing after few hours playing the game will forced you to spend real money or you wont have any progress for a very long periods of time for example level one you need one thousands gold to level up level two need five thousands gold level three need ten thousand gold then suddenly level four need two hundred thousand gold to level up while the pace of the gems spending is stable etc but even after this time the game is still fun enough especially if you know the trick to gain fast money you need to pay lots of gold to raise level cap of every characters in the game including heroes and workers your heroes weapons can break when you reach a certain level weapons will break here and there even the break percentages are very small you will need gems to repair it your shop cannot do anything or else you must scrap it the micro transaction will get worse the longer you play the game at least the first few hours is really really fun and if you know the trick and patient enough you wont need to spend any money the gems are very expensive the cheapest one has the price of a good indie game and the good ones have the price of a a a game
i really enjoyed this game for its ability to get anything in the game minus a few things with either hard work or money however it is now steering very far into the up territory and it makes me sad
fun game for the first while but it lacks more abilities and over all variety for the most part its just clearing out dungeons forever until you re bored of doing so in short the game is good if you re looking for a small break from whatever games you normally play since the game is free i do suggest getting it and playing it for a while
wow this game has made day look amazing there is no survival aspect at all and there are too many guns so its basically just a deathwatch that it nothing more nothing less the only saving grace for this deathwatch is i guess it performs well unlike most of these zombie open world things get sixty frames per second on ultra with a a three hundred and ninety and a i i guess if your just looking for a one hundred player open world deathwatch with zombies chucked in then fill a boots but if your looking for a survival game then look else where may he or day but to be fair this is a genre of game that is struggling to be done well
while i do love this game there is a few problems with it pros fast and fun action especially with teammates the graphics while not groundbreaking is pleasing to look at every character is fun to play as and brings something different to the table with ara and rena being my favourite there are a lot of good tracks in the game cons the game will often encourage you to spend some real money on the game things like costumes extended skill slots pets etc game can get grind heavy later on not like maple story grind heavy but in the very later dungeons you'll need to do a few dungeon runs before you can move on to the next mission overall i do like this game but i can say the micro transactions can be a turnoff for some if you are interested in trying it play the game for a few hours maybe go to la or something and then decide if its worth investing a few buck update okay taking a look at the prices and i can say that some of these are insane i think spending around twenty five for a single costume set is a bit much then again look at what were paying unusual
the basic idea of this game is great the graphics are good the only major problem is that this int hunting i dot know anyone who goes out with a gas helper to tracks talk their own kill this game makes you depend on gadgets rather than any sort of skill the pay system int worth it i will be uninstalling in just a few
this game at first made me upset i saw the free two play label and though this will be awesome i will admit my thoughts as of first were bad i did not like i had only one gun that could only kill one of the two species i was allowed to hunt and the fact that only one map really allowed me to play i will be frank the free two play portion is more of a demo really but you'll notice i have put in lots of hours i did indeed pay for the three month subscription and indeed bought several guns and sights for them this game will cost about four thousand and fifty dollars to get up and active with the full range of everything to enjoy i will say though i am very happy with the quality of the game versus this cost i very much enjoy this game and have found it both a rush and a calm pleasant experience i will not forget that moment where i dropped a buck with a muzzleloader for the first time or the time i killed a charging moose with a world war two german a this game will cost you to enjoy it fully but i do recommend it and i am very pleased i consider it money well spent it is a very detailed fun enjoyable hunting game and with my physical cd collection of hunting games rate this as the best is my score only because sometimes the rendering gets finicky ninety nine of the time works well and plays amazingly looks beautiful and is the best hunting game live played
straight pay grind to win what kind of competitive game allows your opponent to have objectively stronger towers than you why even have the match when there a chance it just comes down to some guy having grinder more than you
early access review heroes and generals is a world war two based shooter that uses a more realistic combat system in this aspect of the game it is fun however the game quickly lost my interest i am a vert an first person shooter player and i have decent aim i have many hours logged in various games and the biggest issue i have with this game is that it does not reward players well for there achievements you make a set amount of money per hour when you rank up a gain more money per hour but it is not much form eight thousands to eighteen thousand five hundred or so the issue i have with this is the player who made four hundred experience points in a ten min match will get the same reward as the player who made twenty the cost of weapons is way to high for the amount you have to play to get them verdict if you are bad at first person shooter games this game if for you but if you are good you will struggle with getting money and probably get frustrated fast
early access review most of the negative reviews are from players who spent less than ten hours playing the game while half of those played less than five hours of the game live seen some negative reviews where the person played less that twenty minutes seriously its a fun game with a decent storyline the combat has been better than i expected after watching reviews on youtube the game does have issues for sure such as getting stuck on the bless title screen and frequent disconnects the frame rate does drop quite a bit too these are also known issues that be wiz has said they re working on fixing be wiz has been working on fixing the issues that keep hoping up all through the early access despite all the hiccups in the game i am having fun got my paladin to lvi forty four a lvi twenty five ranger and a guardian to lvi forty two i hope to see more people jumping into the game the bless splash screen seems to be fixed for me live been able to log right into the game i haven been disconnecting either so that also seems to be fixed also be wiz has given out twenty four hundreds free lumens mia for all of the trouble were experienced this weekend and stuck with the game a still playing the game and having fun have a nice group of players i met in the game really good and helpful community in the game too i play on the heron side and the players are not toxic which is really nice all of the problems from the two day head start have been fixed any time an issue comes up be wiz a quick to take care of them i feel that you tubers have been too harsh on the game and those reviews are scaring away people that have been on the fence about trying the game
early access review day one i invited my friends to join this game kill the crying creatures day two my friends have the final weapon already of one thousand and ten game you'll see your mon trolling you
note while my time played metric is really low on steam live been playing this game since the release of open beta last year and have played at high ranks for the majority of that time this is an excellent card game its my favourite card game on the market because it combines excellent card design with board mechanics that facilitate multiple lines of play on each turn if you want a card game that strongly rewards critical thinking but is easy to pick up and understand i encourage you to give this one a try if you a rent a competitive player then this game is still a blast due to it having the most robust single player modes of any digital card game over the last few months live alternated between playing competitively on the ladder and playing the solo content and they've both been great fun
note some of this is simply opinion because i enjoy the hated franchise pros reasons why i think its great hours of entertainment its flipping free so try it over thirty unique dragons many cool quests and maps fun mini games deus update for new amazing dragon expansions every now and then cons yeah this game does have some problems i will admit the membership thing is dumb once you do all the quests not as fun some terrain glitches sex flying through ground overall i think its a game that may not be for all but anyone who sees it should most certainly try it may
early access review people have been trying to butcher this release because it didst have the best first day the core mechanics of this game is great sure they have a lot to iron out but they re fixing things daily already new content launched and there is no pay to win element whatsoever bless brought me back to mos and ill be staying for a while
early access review if you want a hard every time you carry your friend abel to a a rating clutching every a so sexy it makes your neighbours mums storm like a katrina then download this game and queue with your circus and of am
early access review this game i highly recommend new players to mos to get i am a new player myself and it has taught me the basics of how to play games such as wow it is a very fun game but it does take a while to level up once you get to the higher levels which does require a lot of farming but i guess that how the developers get people to have more hours on the game even though most people ditch games that make you farm enemies just to level up once
dear game i am still writing to you but you int calling i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom sent two letters back in autumn you must not a got there probably was a problem at the post office or something
balanced cant say that about laugh out loud easy to get characters cant say that about laugh out loud variety cant say that about laugh out loud all attacks you have to aim cant say that about laugh out loud easy controls cant say that about laugh out loud you get the idea if you still like laugh out loud at least try this for two hours if you still done like this that fine to each their own
early access review upon asking about several things that were in game the development was completely rude and disrespectful upon asking why the guardian items were under powered they said it would be a pay to win game and when mentioning why a gray rarity item can trump said guardian items easily they said color border on items hold no meaning for rarity so whats the point of making them with a rarity this game may be cross platform but its directed at mobile gaming they should of stuck to two dimensional games like there known for and not of made this garbage May
team fortress two meet its match in the meet your match update and when i mean meet its match i meant meet its end team fortress two is dead rip oct nine july seven twenty sixteen you were real good son maybe even the best July
early access review another battle royal game joins the market but i like this why no building good touch with melee weapons is guns graphics are cartoonish ala footnote if you are unfortunate like me to be cursed with being left handed and use the keypad some of the bindings do not work yes i am one of those weird ones with the mouse on the left side
early access review put down some corruption it began eating my world similar to terra ria if this game had boss fights and better mobs it would be a pretty complete game pigs climbed in my windows because i didst have glass they killed me i was sad fifty five would totally leave my windows open again
product received for freeубоожество disgusting отвратительноif you ever want to play a game where ninety nine of hits on you will be one shot kill then this pile of overwhelmingly disgusting crap is for you if you ever want the play a game where you have a minimal that gives you absolutely no information this is for you if you ever want to play a pathetic excuse of a game where instead of a tank you receive a vehicle with no wheels and made of cardboard but still feels like you driving something that weights over three hundred tones this in is for you i spent on this pile of crap just around five or six and i regret every in penn this piece of should never be on steam in the first place foreigner burn in hell you in awful if you want a game with tank battles involved go world of tanks go armoured warfare go anything but this so called game it brought me nothing but regret and bad feelings nothing
never played wow but i assume this is as close as you could get for free awesome game with tons of features and events you'll never run out of things to do you do have to pay actual money to get any of the cool stuff though
early access review went through one hundred rooms so far filled one hundred buckets with sweat and changed one hundred pairs of underwear so far the game is brilliant it is disturbing and scary but not in that classic violent and gory way i recommend to anyone who wants a bit of cute harmless scare
amazing back then its you'll die from lag servers are crap greed community no teamwork classes that tank do more damage than offensives unless your running maxed endgame untie red soul bounds soul bounds no longer tradable crappy drop rates and more farm than a korean massively multiplayer online role playing game take it from a two year veteran that has the star right below highest tier game wont get fixed laugh out loud has a better community and worst of all kab am just farms the money off it
early access review a cross platform massively multiplayer online from a company that has only been getting better and better at making games its a great game sofar and it will get even better as time passes i highly recommend this game
it has the same problem as any other card game like this same duel you lost in two turns next time you win in two turns one hundred random no skill required takes all the fun out of making your own deck you can just spam monsters and win with no effort especially since you got so low life points is not enough for anything other than a rushing offensive plays land then there all these unstoppable shiny transitions ugh wasting your time
this game used to be good until the started making player versus player specific classes classes way better than others and pay to look good and even pay to win i also didst like the customer service sort of thing they have i was hacked a while back and they told me i gave my password away their reasoning for that is they logged in first then they changed the password i lost over two hundred because of that done pay a damn thing just in case that happens to you other than that good play style
why increase the price in chinese area it was at good price people in china were willing pay that much money to get more fun in this wonderful game however that bargain is gone sad now the price is ridiculous i love this game i payed for lots of aircraft but no more just buy a downloadable content
done be fooled by sixty eight hours my main account most likely has several hundred hours of game play this game offers so much but its rather difficult to get into while being incredibly easy to get in to starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one at first glance its a fun game but nothing you spent much time on now if you look past that there is actually so much the levelling system int what determines a character maxed stats are in game potions are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy along with gear and other items these potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completing certain dungeons to problem is getting this far takes practice determination and grit death is inevitable done let it set you back learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful even the most powerful characters who have all eight stats maxed are prone to quick deaths the game in unforgiving and requires skill but offers much in return for those who deliver
this game is so unbalanced it hurts the weapons are a massive grind to obtain and the classes are completely overpriced finding a server to play takes twenty five minutes and i often find myself joining a server that is already mid end game
team fortress two is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands maybe millions of players on right now playing it is really fun and seven different classes to keep you occupied there is scout class fast and can double jump has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost two shots there is a soldier class has a role playing game very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances there is a pro class has a flamethrower good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out support classes spies snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup there is a heavy good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them unstoppable when the supercharger is ready and activates and that when the heavy is at its best has a big gun and loves it like his own son there is a demo an has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies the engineer can make teleworkers entrance and exit point a dispenser heals him and friends and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances all the things can be upgraded to level three which is the last and best levels there is a spy has a pistol and knife to backstay enemies quickly and quietly the spy is a quiet and sneaky bastard that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantage in life and make their job easier the spy can go invisible and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback the spy can sap the engineers teleworkers both dispenser and the sentry the medic has a needle gun and a supercharger that heals friends the medic is very important in helping the offensive time if medic and heavy combine and the supercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckoned with the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets two health back for every hit the medic gets two he per second as a medic and which no class can do that special ability is to be charge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time and finally the sniper the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time he a sub machine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat his machete is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage his machete is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in two hits other classes three to five hits at least that all the classes live covered the maps are amazing and highly detailed and new maps coming in from the community every month new guns being made skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make a unique and one of a kind new abilities for classes and more to come stuff to buy at the team fortress two store man co is what its called i think its highly over priced but if a done have a thing and a want it bad go to the store and buy it done recommend that when a could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time of that covers team fortress two hope a like my review and please rate it i give team fortress two nine hundred and ten from arcade
this is the best racing simulation game live ever played its free to play and the initial package is good the downloadable content is great too every serious sim racer should try it since it is free what have you got to lose
this game was pretty good i enjoyed going around and fighting the monsters and doing certain quests and learning about the mechanics of the game i also like the fact there a different classes you can be and you can have multiple of them at the same time the game does get a little repetitive though at least in my experience i will admit i don to play as much so i can to judge it completely i am sure there a more to the game then what i saw this game overall was pretty good though
do you feel like playing a game that doesn't involve micro transactions that give people the edge over you do you feel like fighting in a fair fight that int one sided every day do you feel like taking off in your very own spaceship and fighting the enemy and do you feel like getting to know a certain set of weapons without fearing they will get nerved any day well what the are you still doing here deciding wether or not to get this game planet side two is one hundred pay to win the teams are not evenly matched and the developers do nothing about it the spawns are not safe from team killing and blowing up your brand spanking new space ship that you can only spawn in every one thousand and twenty minutes that if you have the resources to spawn one the weapons are constantly nerved and changed making the game harder and harder to play let alone have any sort of fun the competition is gone out of the game and for your own sake just look past this game and get star citizen or even a game that is a better than this snake for the nokia three thousand three hundred and ten
one started to play game got in server for beginners got killed in two min from spawn made a new character four joined another server for beginners five got killed again in less than two min
the actual racing experience is really really well done in this game but ludicrously expensive dec ass on it until the deus cure their insanity and greed and actually price the game contents fairly
pretty simple but really fun its an massively multiplayer online role playing game bullet hell shooter if you can get past the graphics i can but i know all youngsters only want he graphics and crap then its worth playing especially for free
early access review here to start this game was actually the one battle royal that hooked me from the start i was loving it everything about it the classes were cool the forging part was epic and the fact that mounts would remove the feeling of yet another running simulator game was amazing very fast paced since camping was not an option if you wanted to have a fair chance in the end updates started dropping and the game become more and more casual friendly legendary drops from chests and removal of chicken trophies which was fine but still not as satisfying as the first few patches doomsday for this game hit when they decided to remove the classes all along not only did they remove the classes but they remove one of the skill slots along with all epic and legendary weapons this would be fine if you at least could have the ability too craft weapons above uncommon tier i recommended this for a group of friends and they all loved it today no i would not recommend it
early access review this game is quite fun and is a very nice little space game so if your interested in space combat go right ahead and buy this game there are a few small problems for example it takes forever to actually get into a server also there is not a huge variation in the ships you can get but all in all this appears to be a great start to an amazing looking game
its a good game been playing since a and in still addicted to the game the only problem i have with the game as if right now is that a lot and i mean a lot of good skins are locked within ring chests for example pay four hundred gems to get one of these exclusive skins open up the chest get a avatar or ward skin
used to be a good game a few months ago i even bought in game currency but now its just pay to play because they raised the price on everything that you could buy without actual money deus got greedy and made the game crap
early access review would recommend this game if you enjoy massively multiplayer online rugs live played since the tech demo and enjoyed it from the beginning that being said this game still has it cons pros fun game great atmosphere nice community really cool weapons and army combat system cons lots of bugs to be fair it is just a beta takes hours of farming just to craft an item which takes two days to craft this game will destroy your wallet if you re impatient server crashes sorry this review int very long to be fair the game int fully done yet so there is still more to come i would rate this game nine hundred and ten
seriously its good when you can play the game but i have never experienced a game this hard to start i have been trying to get back on this for hours now my problems wont even show up on google searches i did everything i could uninstalling properly is one of them its the worst honestly
this game is absolutely awesome every class has its unique skills and every single one of them is great graphics are not bad and never get boring this game may look hard at the first time but when you reach twenty hours of playing then you cant stop playing and you want to play more and more but the best part is game play controls are very smooth after two hours of playing you can find the class that is made for you i played a lot multiplayer games but from my opinion this game is the best multiplayer game ever made thank you valve May
i have been playing this game for over a year and its one of the better idle games out there i love how you can pick your team and adjust them to get max damage against the enemies there nothing better than realizing one small adjustment will get you tearing up the ranks
after a lots of hours and efforts you give to this game to earn high mar with a seasonal jackass of ten games with quitters and feeders one will say you are the idiot off i can send all the replays to your dumb and see for yourself how the is this mar so trash you will lose all that mar just because you team up with dog of data no wonder they say this game is dying how the this game once so very fun and good now become a disaster thanks to this stupid patch buffs and to matchmaking
fun and mind games nine out of this is a fun game if you like card games like pokemon or yugo its free which is a and it has allot of callbacks to sky rim and oblivion its balanced on all teams but it dose have two bugs that have annoyed me but haven overshadowed the game not counting the magic and giving you you re tern but not giving you magic or a card for your tern it will take up hours of your life if you love card games you always have to think about what the other player has in higher deckhand and that what makes it hard but really fun to the people who made this game thank you
so i see the release date is fourteen oct two thousand and fifteen that seems a long time to be suffering from basic bugs lack of simple features game loads up in tiny window that cant be changed until you start the game and are immediately being attacked apparently fucking makes the game change to full screen but we are supposed to smell that information or sense it through the force once i click the gear for the options menu or anything that pops up a new menu it pops up but cant get rid of it escape doesn't do anything clicking the close button does nothing is the mouse click even activating where my pointer is no visual feedback there the game is essentially frozen as i cant get back to playing whats going on here how ironic that they sell starter packs when their game cant even start properly perhaps i am the one who is wrong i must have downloaded something different maybe maybe in really in a mental institute somewhere locked away inside a padded room experiencing horrific hallucinations my mind certainly cant come to accept this as reality
product received for free early access review fun and easy to play once you get the basics down a bit grind for the ships but once you find the ship you really enjoy playing its great
at the time of the review i have about seven hundred hours logged on steam version path of exile is a hardcore action role playing game with a lot of depth it will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers however this game is absolutely fantastic pros and cons can be subjective so ill just point out main point hardcore can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals not recommended for your first agree today but not pay town eggs micro transaction system is very fair almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in micro transaction store gives anyone an advantage realistic gritty graphics i personally love the graphic and art style but it is highly subjective music varies from meh to absolute blasts from boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies sound design is pretty solid good voice acting and realistic sound support is great and quick i personally had great time using i game has classes however the class only changes how your character looks and from where hesse starts from the skill tree characters can use any skills or items if they have required stats skills are skill gems that can be pocketed in to items ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree you can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided skill tree consists of little upgrades for example three life regeneration or twelve more physical damage some people done like this but those small upgrades stack fast i personally love the freedom of the skill tree game is based on leagues so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new things lot of equipment variance you can find buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple one trading is decent but should be worked on you either need to yell to chat or use third party websites to make trades game has no auction houses or player shops ingate levelling can be quick or slow depending on build and skill max level is one hundred and you can reach level seventy in one thousand and fifteen hours the game has three difficulties normal cruel and merciless you will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline story currently is composed of three acts the one is coming soon and you complete those acts in each difficulty this can be very boring since it can feel like the game is repeating the endgame is a map system you can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs i personally love this system since it offers a lot of variance varying difficulties and different experience the sync should be fixed in the awakening expansion basically you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen this can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration but should be getting fixed soon only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game glad to see it going might have forgotten some main points overall i think path of exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and i recommend it wholeheartedly edit now at over a total and the atlas of worlds expansion is fantastic
i done really know how to feel about this game its like hearthstone but with elder scrolls cards i think if it had more content more in depth card building ability i could see it being good i wish they would have gone the mtg route instead of what the did if they would have taken their time and wanted to make this game good they damn sure could have i think it would have truly been special but they didst its almost like they were trying to ride the wave of games like hearthstone i feel like each game takes little to no thought process i got bored of this just like i got bored of hearthstone sad
blooms to battle audience beginner casual gamer normal gamer expert graphics bad alright good beautiful fantastic difficulty easy average medium hard impossible replay frustrating sleepy boring fun challenging bugs bugs destroy game many bugs few bugs can be used for speed run none encountered length really short zero three hours short four seven hours few hours eight twenty hours long two thousand one hundred and fifty hours very long fifty one thousand one hundred hours
overall a pretty polished game the backgrounds are detailed enough to look nice without giving off massive lag the character animations look natural and most of the dragons look great like all free to play games there are many parts of the game that are blocked off until you purchase them unlike many other games of its kind you can get access to most of the content without paying a dime there are many loading screens but you re gonna come across those with any unity game or even three dimensional game for that matter again for a free game you get a lot more than you paid for
early access review ont play this new epic loot update its a trap for monetary reasons you'll earn nothing and just spend hours in matches to earn blocks you cant even reasonably get the items you want to build your own bots anymore even if you pay there a high likelihood you'll earn nothing for that money its a skinner box and the deus wont listen to change that just look on their forums and see the outcry they only want to deepen their pockets they care far less for their players
was bored through the entire forced tutorial only to be matched with only people with the exact same tier tank as mine which means progression means nothing your competition will always be just as strong did not enjoy any of the one hour fifty two minutes of playing this the original world of tanks is a lot better
early access review so i should start off and say this game is amazing the team behind it are the same that made strike suit zero the actual deus are awesome people to talk with and the game is very fun to play think league of legends dominion but with huge capital ships in space if you are after a different game to play grab this as its lots of fun and the deus are great as well as the community see you star side people
i thought this would be different from mobile version well in disappointed because i already hate the mobile version why cause its not how you play real yugo two field spell card at the same time and three space for card zone whf dude in so sorry dislikes union play this because i love yugo and this game is wow good duelling trading and level up systems and those necessary first gen cards like lvi seventeen million one thousand one hundred normal monster it make this game even more beautiful
the combat is boring you re just pressing one or two and then spamming the a button to finish you combo when using a qwerty keyboard the set switch is mapped on the a button so to switch sets i need to move my hand of was and i cant find the button layout settings the performance is bullshit you cant tell me that i can play so on high at sixty first person shooter but this game wont even run at low above fort five first person shooter when switching to full screen mode the game doesn't render anymore and only the two dimensional elements stay on the screen overall i wouldn't recommend this game and after a few minutes i was already bored and annoyed by this game
early access review i have played hearthstone elder scrolls legends duels mtg and many more and this is the first game that i have write a bad review for its a fun game yes but with the recent patch they have broken the game its just are port everywhere and if that not bad enough its more about ring then skill you can have an awesome game going then somebody gets mana screwed and that game i really tried playing this game but its mana is all messed up the meta is the same and the players even complained to the development on this game about how broken it is but they wont listen so in just leaving this game one hundred do not recommend playing
this game is very good the new expansion brought new mechanics that are sure to modify some me as and that is perfect upon logging to this sky rim expansion you will also get a free random deck composed of both some old and new cards which is a nice touch the two lane system is refreshing so is the run prophecy system giving it a edge over the competition of course some will say pay to win and yes those who can buy packs or campaigns will get a wider choice of cards for their desks but its still achievable with patience for a totally free to play player to beat one who spent strategy plays a good role although being a card game ring is here and can work for or against you the production value is set pretty high as cards are voiced making it feel a but more immersive if you love card games this one has plenty to offer of course be warned you will have to win quite a few matches level up to save up gold to unlock campaign or arena tries i took time to pass over one hundred hours to give my true free to play opinion and sincerely even if some decks completely destroyed me most of the time strategy and a good flowing deck made experience very enjoyable so far best card game i played in or out of steam and i tried plenty
early access review this game is so horrible i know that this game us fee but the graphics no story many lag in all of its servers done recommend a to play this in game
early access review it finally happened is hours in and just about every game every game that counts draft or foundry power mana screwed of well i got twenty nine hours of entertainment for free
there not a lot of space games on the market that many can get behind somewhere down the line deus effectively equated space with complexity so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets graphs and pure busywork however the genre continues to be an itch i can rarely scratch with the rare exception rebel galaxy being one this is another as the synopsis demonstrates this is a creep less mob it has much of the staples zone control for resources except those resources mostly translate to team experience you zone back to a base in order to level up comparable to how you buy items in data or laugh out loud after that its just a five versus five beaten up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment like many space games you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage you otherwise receive like with many team based games its more fun when you play with friends when plugging i lost against artificial intelligence because everyone pulled a lone wolf mentality that just does not work here a lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support a tank ship cannot a unless he has a support ship on his back one match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back as they should but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us the list goes on there is also no pay to win here at best with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra ten utility here some four damage there and only serves for diehard min makers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs the real game here is to pick a few of your favourite ships adapt to their styles and just win with superior skill and it wont matter if an enemy does an extra six damage or not everything else is mostly cosmetic with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other free to play one of the things i want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the games playability or mechanics but the ship designs are some of the best live seen in a long time just opening the games tutorial giving the overview of the pioneer gave me some epic feelings and then just looking at ships from the hangar menu you can tell a lot of love went into their designs every inch is covered you can see storage bays lights under metal panels antennae kudos to the designers live met many like me needing a space game without it feeling like a second job this one fits the bill space mob that what it is
matchmaking sucks so bad it wont even show me my entire match history i genuinely think i have eighty loss rate since the last year and in just trying to be a freaking casual playing on and off a few games a month game used to be easy you hit level thirty and the matchmaking will match you with any other level thirty player being casual or not its time to take the boner they had prepared for you throughout the first twenty nine levels
if min craft and star bound had a baby then creatives would be its name the graphics are extremely awesome and are more detailed than any other vowel type game the features in the game stick out as well such as different block bundles and blueprints the game also has a neat way for new players to get some great blocks early through redeem codes from game streamers also many of the the community worlds have a great helpful community very friendly and helpful as well in so addicted to the game
this is the sequel to the first big three dimensional massively multiplayer online role playing game and i really like it its part of that world of war craft generation of mods much like lot drift and wow but with a lot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much this game is fantasy turned up to eleven
early access review this game would be great if it wisent a flakey unreliable game that is a complete money done get me wrong this game is incredibly fun but its mostly a pay town kind of game after a certain point also the launcher is very unreliable and only lets you launch the game about fifty of the time
the deus need to learn to actually work on a game before they put it in the store and the zombies are too much there are way to many guns for a zombie invasion and the only thing that works is the uninstall button i like a lot of games but this is bad with extreme pts
early access review this game is actually not bad its the kind of game you hop on to burn off some time and have some good laughs with friends in the competitive aspect its not as good as pub or a
early access review pros card dec constructed deck building most similar to mtg magic the gathering multiple play formats player is artificial intelligence player is artificial intelligence draft ranked player versus player ranked drafting pm you keep all cards you get from draft picking reward system is very good am a free to play player i did spend three for the extra pack deal i have been playing two months and have eighty five of the cards feels good man
had a good chance but its been a year since i have played it and when i installed it recently it was still not optimized with huge frame issues from going really high first person shooter to low first person shooter too frequently and when you jump from a moderate hight your character glitches into the ground but you done get stuck or anything just looks ugly overall to many frame issues that are still present a year later making the game feel less progressed then it should if the optimization issues go away then i would defiantly give it a good review i will check back in a few months
early access review use to play adventure quest and adventure quest worlds when i was younger so really hope this game gets good tips that can improve the quality of life in the game nerf ability damage and reduce cast time a lot right click should rotate screen and hide cursor bind a key to auto loot bags fucking to search fucking to collect all or click to claim individually give enemies a bit of life to them seeing enemies stand around doing nothing is boring user interface is minimal and nice but the quest menus could be designed a bit better
early access reviews me that doesn't make mtg fun to play sometimes land flood and land screw it doesn't help that you get hit with this so early on in the game i cant push through the beginner campaign because its just not fun drawing unplayable cards turn after turn i was hoping that a new game that tries the mtg formula would have some things to mitigate the mana issue like hearthstone did also didst like the interface cards look too small on the board and there some space wasted on the sides that could be utilized
early access review cdr check back in a month loot system doesn't reward game is ludicrously grind played since release pres team game was always grind but now its worst than a korean massively multiplayer online role playing game you get these crates which contain from one to four items depending on the mode you played if you re premium you get twice an many items items now have a rarity with the coolest being legendary and the essentials being white arsenic the concept is cool but the items you get are essentially garbage lets say you have premium and you open a plutonium crate you earned from achieving top place in battle arena which is like thirty minutes a sample crate would be after the fix patch seven green items and one blue item doesn't sound bad right a hover a triangle cubes a window cubes that your rare a single wheel a corner cubes a bottom left corner mask cosmetic the flag of poland and a rudder as a new player you cant make much out of that you can upgrade your existing robot but only to a certain point as a played with an of stock of basic items and a working robot my situation you cant do anything with that and as a veterans player its all garbage problem is the distribution of items in the top tier crate plutonium is something like ten white sixty green twenty rare blue ten epic zero legendary and amongst the item pool are cosmetic items masks window blocks flags and you only get one item of each except cubes you get twenty of those so unless your idea of a robot is a handful of blocks with a wheel a hover and a thruster and a single gun this game will make you work very hard to get a working set of items even more so if you want to upgrade from the tier its just not fun the rewards a rent rewarding and they a rent coherent there is this recycle forge system but right now you get twenty of the value of the item so if you take all the items from that plutonium crate you can melt them down and craft one or two tier sags you need like nine to be effective at four hundred robots each lets say you want to craft that flak cannon that guy blew you up with over and over in the last match seventy five thousand robots that shotgun like thing that other guy blew half you bot off in one hit with one hundred and twenty two thousand five hundred robots that a lot of crates like three hundred three hundred premium to place victories in battle arena the longest match mode if you lose you get the bronze crate regardless of your performance a positive point in all this is that the crate tiers seem to not matter so you can just practically idle lose the game and get your item bronze crate and progress as fast as that other guy with his carefully crafted bot and hard earned victory that getting plutonium crates check back in a month
its a real good game love it but one problem need more buildings to get in too as well as get on roofs and fix when you hit zombies with a car kill them done crash and do nothing to the zombies but offer all its an amazing game keep up the good work
this is the dial like with the most depth and design complexity live ever played there so much character development possibilities the game is amazing at giving tools to create the most crazy and ambitious builds and to make it incredibly rewarding from the gigantic passive tree to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works its so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character and then the world of area last is just amazing to explore lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diabolo one the soundtrack is incredible as well hand down my favourite diabolo like and one of my fave games of all time and its truly free money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help the few cons you cant turn the camera meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when you re a long range hero self founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game act two is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game
set macro to left click set a button on mouse to toggle repetition of said macro put netflix up on second monitor go back to laura clicker press toggle the repetition of the macro watch daredevil check back every so often to upgrade
i love dungeons dragons rugs this game uses the most edition i like from do the edit have a great forgotten realm adventure focused on never winter city and its player versus player is also fun to play
early access review honestly a better version for pub i have pub and it is very without a good personal computer you cannot play it at all i thought that it would be the same for this but no it is so much better the graphics are stunning and it is so smooth there are minor bugs that i have experienced and such a fun game to play with or without friends i also has amazing optimisation and visuals with massive mountains and trams everywhere also this game brings a whole new thing with battle royal where it is quick and there int any drop from the plane bull nine hundred and ten favourite game at the moment
early access review have to pay a free two play game just to get the most out of the game love building and destroying but good i see comments that it was int this way so this makes me more till all are one
early access review one of my favor ate games ever and that a lot coming from a long time gamer in not going to spoil it all but ill just say in speechless of how amazing the game is it has everything a game should have flawless game for being a early access and i just say that because of the textures are not one hundred amazing but that being picky still overall best game ever that it so much fun download this game you wont regret it
awesome game big fan of ace combat series war thunder and apache so obviously in a huge fan of air combat simulators this one is highly detailed with awesome graphics that leave me wishing for two things a better gaming computer and more content not that there int plenty already
this a ton on my phone back in the day didst clock any hours on this personal computer version but maybe i will someday still its worth checking out especially if you re a fan of the blooms to games or to games in general note there is a fair amount of grind for towers but done worry eventually you get there a
early access review really wanted to like this game started out okay had a pretty positive cd ratio fun hiding from tanks and air planes the progression is just too slow sixty hours to hit level five still have the same guns live had since the beginning because you have to repair your so you can never save up the to buy upgrades or move forward they have this set up to force you to spend money in tired of it best part about this game is uninstalling
this game sucks just walk really slowly around looking for the one of animals that inhabit the in place realizing you done have a license to shoot the damn thing no you gotta pay for that crap
in not really sure how many hours i have at this point i started somewhere back in twenty elevens and have two max level accounts this is by far the most intense and skill based mob out there every attack you must place yourself on the target there is absolutely no hand holding in this game now that its on steam i cant hold myself back the only reason it took so long is because it was so popular they didst even need to bother get it now
one its free its simple sexy girls what are you waiting for careful if a interested of steam trading cards even if you buy downloadable content you will not get cards it seems so see reviews of downloadable content
early access review coming from hearthstone and magic duels this game is combination of the two but better than both heavily addicted to this right now graphical style of hearthstone and complexity of magic the gathering all in one cards are well designed and very interesting game is quite generous for cards and packs there are many game modes including a true draft format my only complaint is that game has the ancient stupid land sigil in this based mana system of mtg so be prepared to be mana screwed or flooded occasionally hearthstone simple but effective mana system is simply better
the game was really good but unfortunately after the expansion fall of the dark brotherhood real cash to play or a gold which us a lot to grind it has kinda become slightly a pay to win game because it gives you some best overpowered cards in the game which everyone uses almost everyone uses same overpowered decks it has become ridiculous literally same decks which kinda kills the point and fun of the game i still play it because i managed to scrap sam good cards before the expansion so i can still be competitive but i cant imagine how a new player could survive this bullshit
this game is so boring it doesn't even give you an idea of what you re suppose to do it just throws you in at a random camp site and you have to work the rest out yourself done even consider downloading
super steep learning curve but incredibly rewarding once you get it right other than a couple tutorials there is almost no landholding at all i wish it were a bit easier to play through but cant really blame the developers as this is a simulator more than anything i played most of this in virtual reality on the vive and is the closest live come to the experience of flying in real life from any game the translation of the interface to virtual reality has much to be desired but can easily be overlooked by everything else that shines in this game
early access reviewer pay to win very unbalanced i almost bought premium but now in glad i did editors of game play still think its pretty unbalanced tanks planes spawn campers is teams with nothing specially for people just starting maybe they try to get new people to get premium early the game is not bad but not worth buying price premium items if it would be a one time deal and without shortcuts for anyone then id spend some money but since its not id recommend the game to one with deep wallet or tons of free time i done know withered comments from retards will be removed
early access review lost an over watch comp game because the invasive updater closed my game window in the middle of a game and wouldn't let me get back until i agreed to the update this game installs a background updater that is pinned to the startup it was a pita to get rid of also the game play is buggy and there a rent many options in the settings
i played the old flash games in high school with friends and this certainly lives up to those its clear however that this was rushed why do i think its rushed simple there no exit button you have to tab out and close it or alt of there are pay to avoid grinding elements in it which is a disappointment its still an enjoyable blooms to experience though
early access review would rest boobs again real review amazing game you never get bored but the game needs a bigger variety of pickups and weapons some more maps and legends would be nice and please nerf we sang good graphics but low enough for any computer to be running it it is comparably better than smash bros but legends need better background stories we also need a campaign or some story line we need a better tutorials because when my friend just started he didst know what to do whats so ever we also need a report button i seen some douches in this game but overall amazing and fun game
i would highly recommend this absolutely incredible sim the attention to detail in flight dynamics and on board weapon systems really place this combat sim in my top ten you earn every kill you make and gather great satisfaction with every landing you achieve a massive one thousand and ten
early access reviewed it apparently twenty minutes doesn't justify this review as valid if we ignore the psychology of making snap judgements and the fact i know what kind of games i like in going to give a longer review based on my short time and explain how i game to my conclusion of not good why i done feel someone else would enjoy it this doesn't make me a hater because i really enjoyed the two dimensional adventure quest the game play you move with is and and turns the camera around behind you you can also move the camera around with the mouse basic click on things do actions based on what said thing is collecting loot is annoying with no real feedback on if you actually picked up the loot and you can only pick it up by clicking on it not by walking over it in my short game time i managed to get through the intro stage and to the main town enough to figure out the game play was fairly standard drivel nothing existing nothing fun nothing that got me hooked i done really have much to say other than i didst enjoy it the interface its awful you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind and then the interface for mobiles was just updated to work on pcs games can be designed to work on mobiles and ported to personal computer just fine see timber an that was originally a mobile game and this game doesn't do that very well the font is awful and i could notice some of the textures didst scale nicely to one thousand nine hundred and eighty speaking of textures the graphics i really liked the design and style of the two dimensional game it looked good and had a nice aesthetic to it in not a graphics over game play kind of guy and do enjoy games you could argue had poor graphics proteus for example or moira however this game is selling itself as a massively multiplayer online that means its hoping ill play it loads if that the guess in kind of hoping for something a bit better it has playstation one esquire graphics and not in the good way in guessing this is because of the fact its designed for mobiles the writing story you might feel i cant give a fair review of the story and i would one hundred agree with you in going to talk about it anyway the writing is dire cringe worthy and really a thoughtful you can tell it want done by someone who knew the first thing about writing its not even done in a casual way just boring unfunny unity words on a screen it didst hook me in it didst want me to find out more or want me to play it was just bad in summary i find this game bad and i didst enjoy it if you played hours upon hours of the two dimensional game then this is going to suck and you wont enjoy it if you've never played adventure quest before then who knows you may enjoy this but it is nothing like the game its based on personally save your time and effort and try a different game original review gave it twenty minutes of my life in those twenty minutes i found out it was nothing like the game i wasted so many hours in high school in it has lost a lot of charm on the way poorly written cringe worthy jokes an interesting feature is that you can play the same game on the personal computer and your phone eventually does mean the personal computer version is scaled quite far back done bother wasting your time on it it is free but i would feel insulted if i had to spend money to try that out May
i gave this a shot after years of waiting and it became free i wanted to fall asleep while i was playing it i guess if you have insomnia and want to fall asleep you can play this game to help even with a gtd the frame rates still stutters besides the beautiful character creation which is i think is on par with do its really lacklustre everything screams stiff the world is kinda bland and combat is this strange stiff and boring tab targeting it attempts to do go quest style but the world and story just int as immersive or fleshed out i still can remember till today gas two non world with their frozen kegs but bless is just forgettable there just int enough culture woven into the races i done recommend you to play it unless you need insomnia relief is they are releasing bless unleashed on consoles with reworked combat and storyline
pretty good game explore more than five hundred floors rooms of a spooky mansion owned by a cutesy cartoon ghost girl filled with arcade mini games puzzle sequences random monsters hunting you down while you try to escape and some pretty interesting plot twists it may be called house of jump scares but the atmosphere and environment has a large impact on how spooky spooky jump scare mansion can be play with friends for bonus laughter and scares May
done let my time on here fool you live been playing for quite a long time in the open beta live been playing card games for about twenty years and est is easily my favourite free to play collectible card game right off the bat as you start the story and begin to level up they dump tons of free cards soul stones and gold on you even letting you choose between which ones you want from time to time then you can start levelling solo arena and if you do decently enough the rewards from that will be enough to get you enough runs to become grand champion after that done you should have a decent enough grasp on arena to start levelling in is arena and so on the deck size and a card limit as well as no unique legend aries may seem daunting to build a competitive deck but if you settle on an archetype you wanna play and then soul trap aggressively you can build a competitive deck well before you re even finished levelling this game has the most generous prize support of any free to play game and even then the main incentive to buy packs is the bundles that include awesome alternate art versions of select cards other perks include the fact that the game adds at least one new card every month that you can get up to a complete set of as ranked rewards the ability to grind easy soul gems by playing practice mode and the well balanced and diverse meta May
early access review this game could be great but so far its horrible for starters you stuck with a massive grind to even get a pistol than done expect fair fights most the the fights live been in the match starts with a twenty three to one disadvantage or advantage meaning the game has no auto balance future and can easily join a game where you are losing twenty one or even more and are being spawn camped the class system seems nice but like everything else feels half finished and thrown together you can switch to another class only after grinding rank and once you join a game as that class your stuck there is no planning and you mainly see games full of infantry and nothing else because you cant change character to one that is needed on the battlefield the user interface and lighting and visual in general frankly are the worse live seen in a long time the lighting seems to either bee to bright like you just left a dark room or too dark and cant see the fogs so horrible that you normally cant see or make out an enemy till your five feet from them the graphics are dated and poor quality and the mechanics of the guns and vehicles are even worse frankly i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone and the excuse that its beta int working here this is another game that will probably never leave early access because it gives the developers and excuses to never fix or finish the game
well as a substitute to monopoly its good although it does have problems a when given the option to start a new table i usually take it as its a good way for players to customise a game for their friends but this usually ends in joining a full table anyway making the option pointless and when you join a full game occasionally you a rent able to leave practically forcing you to play a game you done want to take part in a the game needs a chat function emo is a rent enough especially when a player is taking forever to roll the bots a huge problem they are pretty much impossible to defeat its like they entered god mode or something and its genuinely annoying recommend this game should changes be made
four thousand hours later i was into this game before it went on steam this game is still terrible why one bad net coding usually get five hundred and fifteen ping on team fortress two servers and in commonly accused of ping masking despite the fact that i just have good internet but in els word no matter how good your internet is you re going to have bull rap lag problems that can give you major based on your character i have people in els word saying that i have the worst internet they've ever seen but they re generally new players who cant understand that the real problem is that the net code is she and my internet is really fast character imbalances have a saying in this game that perfectly describes how it is manage out with the old in with the new older classes characters are generally thought of within a range of high and low the newer characters are agreeably neither and are regarded as god tier by the community why you ask log likes to add enormous advantages to the newer characters for some reason probably to get money from experience medals and such the update that really started to screw up the balance many years ago was the a update and its just been going downhill from there three community because of dogs always broken balance the players of the community spend most of their time ranting about how bad everything is rather than playing the game a lot of players specifically is mains tend to argue about the balance of their characters until no end just to defend their skill there are a few good players that done do this but its generally something pretty dumb people do pop up has always been the only reason i ever still play this game the only problem is how easy it is to get away with trolling playing really cheaply players themselves have had to create a meta for how people should play so nobody gets trolled but it still happens some people will stop at nothing to get those few extra rank points or another rank even sacrificing their reputation along the way up there are lots of things that you can only get by being app player and skill slot ami rite the game is really pay to play and people that put their money into getting insane gear levels end up being ridiculously overpowered and can stomp on you pretty much regardless of your skill level this has existed all throughout els words history but has become a major major issue when the economy started getting messed up the economy probably one of the worst parts of the game in general because of how up this game is getting certain items really matters but that can be insanely hard with this economy prices are overinflated to hell and some sellers of ice burner sets are only taking cash because of how worthless de has become in this game you'll find that some items are worth over eighteen billion de starting from the bottom nowadays is very very hard and log refuses to do anything about it the grind it used to be worse but nobody likes grinding for their levels and gear id much rather just player versus player in the freaking game now the major problem is korea has different experience tables than a which makes the grind a lot easier on them this developers seem to only cater to the needs of the korean players and pay almost no attention to natl unless you find out a way to play the korean els word this is not a game you want to play
the ideas is good but sadly it doesn't real execute the term unlocking the downloadable content means you can work out the skill tree but not that you already can work with them also keep in mind for the steam version you need internet connection if i knew this i didst even buy the starter kit and read a book or two the concept works but that is saved with it if they improve this its a good game simulator
i find this game fun to play during prime time hours it is sadly in a state where you can only get the big battles during peak times which seems to be in the evening i have had great unique long drawn out battles that cannot be duplicated in other fps wonderful firefights that are reminiscent of the old al eric valley in world of war craft where battles last for hours and both sides are trying to push past a choke point the experience this game gave me made me wanting something more from the genre it is the kind of shooter i hoped the genre would have turned to and evolved from rather than pub and footnote so much potential
early access review like the game easy on the eye nice physics on movement and shooting not hit a saggy server fast paced but not manic like doom or unreal maps remind me of cod black overpowered nuke nice balance between camping and rushing players just over an hour in not seen any hackers as yet one of the best free to play shooters live played in years congrats to the deus nice job guys
early access review the game is abnormal fantastic something new in the world of battle but showing is bad hell cunt fix anything cunt play normal it is very sad but that how it is for now i will put finger up i a waiting for update and fix this if not a lot of player will stay with down and leave this game
causes mood swings eating disorders triggered sociopath and a chronic breakdown of human decency also fills the second language requirement for numerous eastern european universities forty two thousand and ten would play again
awesome street basketball game with emphasis on teamwork and lots of sparkling rewards from mini games everywhere lots of fun best experienced with friends or like minded people you can buy power aka stat increases with real money which is a shame but when all comes to all your skill has to carry you regardless at least in the rookie league as its currently free to play there is no reason not to check it out if you re the slightest on the lookout for some teamwork based game
early access review this game feels more like a mobile game than anything else the had layout appears to be similar to something you see on a mobile game the camera feels wonky and its a lacklustre grind est
reviews for the deaf and hard of hearing reviewing overall gamete is fantastic there are a horde of game modes to play that can keep you coming back to this old game for a while while i prefer man versus machine these days i do often play community servers for a good ctr or payload round most first person shooter games team fortress two uses was space and control for mobility related issues keys can be easily rebound to whatever suit your capabilities i rebound couch to space and jump to a side mouse key for example as for sound with the exception of spies and spy related events such as sapping of your equipment there are visual cues to accompany the audio for some weapons that you can hear being fired you may not be able to see that you re being shot at such as some sniper rifles this is something to watch out for for game play accessibility i give it one thousand and ten you can realistically play and succeed at all of the normal no mod game modes available with or without sound subtitles caption for deaf how gamers team fortress two offers subtitles and captions something valve has a solid history of providing live found the default captions lacking in man versus machine however fortunately there is a way to use external captions and i have turned to clover india for that help steam community ideas a deaf gamer i use captions over subtitles whenever i have the choice as the distinction tends to be between important information in captions and flavor text in subtitles that said i have not used the subtitles option for to for captions i give it six hundred and ten normally nine hundred and ten with external captions such as from clover india supports in game voice communication but the pacing of the game does not make it essential game play can tolerate typing so many other players in servers tend to have no problem accommodating having to type even so many game modes done require much communication for casual play for man versus machine typing can be made difficult at times and this problem can be exacerbated by queuing random teams each time you play and having to explain things repeatedly which can be a gamble live written a guide to try to standardize voice bind calls in man versus machine until valve changes voice binds to be more inclusive if ever help steam community i overall accessibility of incorporates visual signals for almost everything that happens in game its ability to rebind keys and add custom captions make it pretty accessible for most deficits in the gaming population overall nine hundred and ten May
early access review once was a nice game one by one all cool features got removed now its i done get why a would remove nice things i cant evening play solo at the moment
this is probably the best massively multiplayer online role playing game game that i have played my entire lifetime the characters are very unique from each other to expand on this a little more every character has their little special something for example add does not have an awakening mode but instead has something called do mode forgot what do stands for also the layout of the fields and dungeons are amazing the soundtrack is also something i enjoy you can even marry someone in this game just a random titbit of info the list of things that make this game awesome and very entertaining in my opinion just keeps going for miles and i done want to take the time to make the entire list because that would takes moons to type but all in all this game is very creative and unique and better than other morphs that i have played and probably the most enjoyable
story do game a normal fantasy story not so good not so bad just normal cinematic saggy old looking but still makes you wanna four more hours then they put another cinematic and that go on like all the game music and sounds good and basic musics that done hurt your brain so much seven hundred and ten graphics old dark looking good atmosphere giving stuff not so good on light putting tho content for a free to play game there is so much to do but still you feel like something missing controls basic do controls if you are not use to it that stuff its a bit hard game play its says free to play but there are thinks you need to buy if you want to enjoy the whole game play make this game fifteen dollar make every content free work on it bit more add more dungeons raids and player versus player arenas like you want to make a game for someone you love improve light and story there you go a good game
reasons to play smite you re getting tired of the old mob formula and you want a new twist you like third person action games you like competitive team based games that require strategy and teamwork you want something fun to play with your friends for free you have no better way to spend your time since you have no life responsibilities note i have many more hours than what is displayed as i have played this game before it was released on steam since the day it came out of beta in fact
early access review finally uninstalled after the last patch it had so much potential to be a good game deus think the community are idiots and wont listen to a word they say in done rip
wandered through about ten rooms without seeing anything then i get startled by an adorable cardboard ghost lots more rooms some more cutesy cardboard jumps and a few notes a a a a king about how thirsty the writer was then i found a note that just had some weird stuff about choking sounded crazy i turn around and of my god what the a a a a is that that is not cute or cardboard nope nope nope in out of here hey i wonder if it followed me into this next room nope it followed me nope nope nope
early access review this game is lot of fun it is heavily inspired by min craft which i can tell but it is really original too since its free to play possibilities in game are endless if you have pretty good imagination and creativity you can build some pretty cool stuff but a ill rate one thousand and ten for this game because it is simply amazing game i recommend this to anyone who enjoyed playing min craft or any new people to the genre
after sinking over one thousand three hundred hours into the game i have decided that i may as well write a review the big question is where do i begin if you are a new player planning on playing planet side two go right ahead the first hundred hours that i played this game where filled with the most rewarding atmospheric and epic game play experience i have ever had the pleasure to enjoy in any multiplayer first person shooter game witnessing my first zero was quite a sight to behold the battlefields of aura is choked with arm or infantry and aircraft amazed me as i had never witnessed anything of the scale battles that rage for days where both sides get pushed back and forth with the ebb and flow of the red tide of blood was really quite a thing to witness the unknown lands that seemed to stretch into infinity detailed as far as the eye could see i was simply astounded by the scale and atmosphere soon enough i met some players on my faction that invited me to an outfit we became very good friends and remain so to today even though we done play planet side very much anymore the satisfaction that comes with accomplishing tangible goals through teamwork is definitely the most rewarding part of the game wether that goal is as simple as destroying an enemy vehicle or as profound as shifting the tide of a battle where hundreds of players are engaged these victories are truly the best part of planet side unfortunately planet side two is not without its problems many of which are so embedded into the core of the game that they are unrecoverable the realization of these has turned me into a grizzled veteran in the war on aura is i simple cant go back to those first hundred hours the massive scale of playstation two often leads to one sided battles where the losing side is totally outnumbered and are pushed back base after base until the amass enough players to engulf the enemy in an even bigger swarm the unique armament of the waring factions ensures that one side will always have something very powerful that the others do not the game play balance is in a constant state of flux doomed to forever nerf and buff never achieving true balance the grind can be quite painful at times especially for new players this only encourages new players to use the cash shop to purchase weapons and experience boosters with their own money the player classes are in no way balanced one being much more powerful than the others despite all this i would still recommend you place planet side two even with the poor balance and painful grind for experience cherish the good moments in this game and try not to take it too seriously find a faction you like and join an outfit done spend money until you are sure you will play for a while in not sure what the future will hold for planet side two but in sure as hell that ill want to be there to witness it live free in the no may
great game to help strengthen your friendship includes great features like by aspired and bedtime some may say its all luck and pay to win but they re just sore losers the game is so good they inspired a hit board game called monopoly you may have heard of it one thousand two hundred and twelve must have May
pros very fair few model the instructor story tutorial is alright just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda but the game deserves praise for giving you access to a generous number of fifty cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start or at least after finishing the tutorial you can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of sky rim expansion with in game currency in less than thirty hours of game play i was able to buy two of these decks for one thousands coins which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorial story great art yes designs at their best each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at and they all come with accompanying sound effects and or voice over the games ring is one hell of an important factor in winning games there a big overlap between what a common card can do when ring favor it and what a legendary card can do when ring is not in its favor what this means is that you absolutely do not need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it good cards give you an edge but good deck synergy and ring still reign supreme great car deck identity the game really benefit from the yes theme each card and deck built around it oozes personality and each combination of different races or lack of yields a solid recognizable theme different from all others recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game this ties into the games balance learn to pace your decisions every deck has a certain rhythm to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains learn them to make the most of each deck cons way way way too many ring mechanics yes this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game but you'll eventually be on the receiving end of the ring beating numerous cards have effects such as summoning a random creature no not a random creature from your deck any random creature from the entire game you will get screwed over by a hail mary at some point you need to learn to accept that this also ties into the next con built in comeback mechanic as you burn through your opponents life points you'll break a total of five runes each time you break a rune your opponent draws a card if your opponents card is a prophecy card they'll be able to play it immediately with no cost this can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly so most of the games meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times you are never entirely safe overall i recommend the game to all fans of tag games if you ever played a tag game you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it and you done have to pay a price of entry just to see if its going to appeal to you
the huger games mode docent even work because every time i try to load it all it does is just freeze closes walking takes so long to get to one location to another and finding a car is basically impossible there are no oceanic servers making it hard for people like australia to play this game and cant change the resolution of the game without it freezing and then when i return to the game it docent change
early access review know its an early access game and it has been released for about four days but in not gonna recommend it because pros great atmosphere cool animation dumb funny armours helmets loot boxes footwear it center you can open windows climb ladders cons a ridiculous launcher opening many useless tabs not much available options to optimize the games replay is not so smooth you cant even climb a ladders all amount of players almost twenty for each game i had to search the whole map to find however live played it for less than an hour but these are the things i came up with
early access review this is what we all had hoped mtg would become if you are a magic refugee looking for a digital collectible card game nothing comes closer than eternal the tutorial is too long and boring but once you get into ranked ladder and draft yes actual drafting it is quite awesome
might been a good game i will never know wouldn't respond to the controller keyboard or mouse all which work on every other game i have read other reviews before diving in on this one
early access review great game lots of fun play modes against other players or the artificial intelligence lots of free rewards and daily quests to start the game and accumulate the cards even going the free to play route regular balance patches and expansions a diverse meta of aggro mid range and control decks and lots of content to explore great game all around i really enjoy playing it and urge you to try it to make sure to check out the sub edit at wow geddit competent boardgames and wow eternal army com as well
what i like everything special the character what i hate i must pay some money to get awesome things like costumes because the cheapest costume in the mall it cost at least twenty six dollars one dollar one hundred ching
ninety nine of the reviews on the hunter are negative because people complain about how it is marketed as a free to play game if you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money but after you get a membership the game becomes soon too much better you need to be patient to play the hunter and by the looks of the other reviews not many people on steam are make sure you play the tutorials or you will have no idea what you are doing and maybe watch a youtube video or two a a the hunter beginners guide twenty sixteen by holocaust hunter if you are a new guest i recommend sticking to the towers and calling the deer to you as they can see smell and hear you a lot better with guest clothes on there is free shotgun in the store which i done think many guests know about so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting done worry about wasting ammo because it is unlimited in the vicinity of a range or lodge or go pheasant hunting and if you like it buy the membership i also recommend going to the hunter on wiki as it gives you tonnes of information on reserves and where you can specifically find the animals
so i played the game for free actually enjoyed it told my brother he enjoyed it too to play together we joined someone else server so that wasn't really an issue i thought to myself well i want to hunt more than the basic stuff tbs so i bout premium three month licence then something magical happened even after the licence you need to pay more money to buy the right weapons for certain kills then the right ammo then more money for scentless gear then more for hides and tents and scopes and anything else even remotely enjoyable i tweeter them about it they done care
autistic eleven gear carried players can beat you in three hits then call you a spamming noon as they play the most broken classes using the most broken gear half the community is full of fat antisocial take who try really hard to act normal and conform to normal social standards i a mimicking black memes what are those deep nuts it center and its really really cringe worthy because being a lights in myself its embarrassing knowing that some fat greasy whites american kid is trying to act like me and associate himself with my culture ave is boring the alg rhythms for ice burners are broken to say the least i had a friend open up two hundred and fifty worth of ice burners only to get six pieces of the actual set extras included some classes are unplayable because of how they a rent broken enough to stack up with others servers are poorly maintained and are constantly saggy my guild master is saggy as and he lives a whole hour away from me with the level boost event you would think log would have the idea that making bigger and more servers would be a thing to put on their list guess not gotta push out another ice burner and item mall event
please done play this game live played about one thousands hours game is so a a a king good but the players i brooke my door for a game like ten minutes ago a a a a this game a a a a valve a a a a data a a a a players a a a a everything
this is a side activity video game and you can play it while you play your main game what i mean with that lets say that you are playing data two and you die while you are dead you can do some clicks in this game to get gold until you are revived in data i done see a reason to buy the docs except if you want to help the developers pc personal computer console gamer a
a game with a good concept combat system and character class design and has potential but has horrible optimization and player friendly settings on top of that targeting modes are different for classes some have action and others have classic which is autistic for two reasons one already it changes the game play for each person drastically how can you make player versus player like this even if a targeting mode wouldn't work for a system make a work around that farmer for players its better for each person to choose the targeting mode they want test them out maybe swap between them rather than forcing it onto them makes for a more friendly system and better game play
early access review as a person that has played adventure quest worlds for over seven years i have to say that this game disappoints me further than i expected i thought it was going to be a lot more fun and an upgrade from the two dimensional game i used to play but this game it doesn't matter if i played just like ten minutes but it was a waste of time it is basically wow but with a mix of adventure quest and adventure quest worlds in it really disappointed i played the alpha and it was amazing but this is a piece of
supernovas happen because of when a sun is formed it has a lot of gravity this gravity pulls the matter mostly hydrogen into the core of the sun where it undergoes extreme amounts of pressure and causes the hydrogen to fuse when the hydrogen fuses it turns into helium and this fusion gives of a small amount of energy but remember there are billions of these fusions happening simultaneously so that energy adds up real quick when it releases energy the particles have the energy to fight the intense gravity which is why stars grow ont immediately collapse now helium is denser than hydrogen so it goes down father into the core and gets fused as well the helium is fused into oxygen and carbon and emits even more energy for the matter to fight gravity and expand but then there a problem when carbon and oxygen fuse into iron no energy is given off this means that the star will started having an iron core but no problem because you still have some hydrogen and helium and stuff but eventually all the hydrogen will run out leaving the denser helium oxygen and carbon to fight the intense gravity then the helium goes and then gravity starts to take its toll the star begins to shrink because the fusion of oxygen and carbon doesn't produce enough energy to fight gravity until eventually gravity packs the oxygen carbon and iron closer and closer without enough energy to fuse or fight back then the gravity becomes way too much for the matter and the star implodes ripping apart some of the iron and carbon and oxygen back into their original helium and hydrogen and creating a massive cloud of irradiated dust ready to start the process all over again and if the star is big enough aka has enough mass like a blue giant star all the heavy elements in it keep of compressing pass the supernova point and becomes a singularity some of the stuff does go supernova but most of it goes into the singularity
this is better than most tags due to better strategies within the variety of cards available like most tags it is more pay for less grind than pay to win if your casual i would skip unless you done mind spending a little to get a decent set of cards i do feel the cards you obtain from campaign and bought card sets are decent to the point you done need to spend too much initially to get going i do recommend purchasing one of the discount packs as they are a great deal and you'll have a decent starting cards to create a deck that suites your play style i previously gave a thumbs down for the draw system per their recommendation i looked at their website and got some tips that helped it looks like i did need to include search type cards to help situations that result in too much power or units some of the new modes are interesting as well i changed my recommendation to recommend as this development is responsive and helpful overall for a tag this one has great potential
this is an amazing game at first i thought this was another min craft ripoff but i decided to try it anyways i was absolutely stunned with the results the graphics are amazing little to no lag open world survival and best of all its free i would definitely recommend this game especially if you like min craft
hi i played duel links for only a few days i built a meta deck and got to legend one rank in two days heres my two cents on the game not really a fun game too much grinding necessary ave is boring seriously it is using auto duel is boring i wish they removed ave completely competitive decks change every time a new card pack comes out in the shop high level player versus player is quite boring since you will be using the same meta deck as your opponent the grind from legend three to king of games is to since you need five wins in a row to get too log from legend three so you might be stuck bouncing from legend twelve and three for the entire season
early access review longtime a worlds veteran here been playing since twenty tens this game is pretty good so far it still feels like the classic a worlds keep up the good work art entertainment
early access review this game is full of russian servers which means six hundred ping sad i hope there are europe servers soon because the game looks really fantastic but servers and ping is the issue atm ill be waiting for europe servers for this game
early access review its world war two game i love the game about world war two good game play it fun and if you play with your friend it truly fun it like a battlefield game you can play tank fighter plane sniper paratrooper or you can modified your infantry to antitank guys marksman machine gunner no team play i doesn't see anyone play like team they play for their own so many camp sniper camp tank camp no kill am for camping sniper seriously hard to see the enemy i doesn't say graphics are bad but it hard to spot iron sights are too small i love to play rifle and i miss every shot or rifle can upgrade to automatic rifle well pay two win yes it likely but keep it work the game is still good
early access review as of right now i firmly believe aqua three dimensional is strictly for the fans a good nostalgia trip and vast improvement over the other games in terms of frame rate alone still rough around the edges for now but hey its still early access lets just hope its not permanently early access
to sum up what is being said within the twenty thousand reviews is pretty long but in short it goes like this for people new to this game it is a brilliant second world war arcady flight sim with different styles of play and many different aircraft later on the game requires a lot of money to actually progress anywhere if you even manage to reach tier four out of five you will understand what i mean by this if your not prepared to put money on this game i wouldn't suggest getting your hopes up for it for people with four hundred hours or those who have played it prior to patch one hundred and thirty seven we all feel your frustration the company switched from the all knowing all loved to the more give us your money what one hundred and thirty seven added was different way of progression from the much more simple one hundred and twenty tier system with twenty being top and one being the start it was compressed into only five tiers what was expected was rough boundaries leg tier four is tier four well nope if you play tier four your more than likely to experience the wrath of a mig pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game still not the worst part thought both arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the artificial intelligence gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to give me all your money if you want to be good the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy not to mention unbalanced aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premium account or buy paying to progress all this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just in front of it which comes stock so its probably worse the game went downhill from one hundred and thirty seven flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or you'll slam into an invisible it tree the games deus weren't bad people and still a rent they re running a company and it seems they need a way to make more money from it unfortunately this is one of the ways they chose they used to listen and fix almost all bugs and issues now i think money has taken over a once great game that used to be a brilliant now instead it is the biggest example of pay to progress
early access review this is a very fun card game its got complexity and variety compared to other online card games i think this is probably the best live played deck building is the most fun live had in a while deck size and limits are sufficiently big to let you experiment while most cards are balanced against each other thus letting you build interesting and unique decks the game has just had one expansion and already there a huge number of viable and competitive decks out there the best thing about it is that the game doesn't encourage aggro decks nor does it discourage it its perfectly viable to play any kin of deck cards done depend so much on ring like they do in hearthstone what they do is clear from the beginning as a result you done feel you depend on luck as much as you depend on your wits the only luck aspect of the game is what cards you draw more on that later there is no deck limit you can have as many decks as you like guess what blizzard no one is getting confused perhaps the most important feature of the game is that its not pay to win its play in there a lot of ways to gain gold cards and packs that done involve you paying for it every time first of all there an exclusive game mode gauntlet which you can play for free and as many times as you like you battle against seven artificial intelligence opponents and each victory grants you a reward chest depending on how well you went you get an appropriate reward and its very easy to gather gold if you are willing to grind for it its not boring either because the artificial intelligence opponents are random and are actually competent at the game then aside from gauntlet there are two other modes where you need to pay gold or real money to enter draft and forge forge works like hearthstone arena only you battle against artificial intelligence opponents again draft works like mtg draft games and here you get to fight against real humans whats so great about these modes well aside from the final rewards you can get you can keep all the cards that you drafted that right you pay twenty five hundreds gold forge or five thousands gold draft and you get to pick cards according to your collections needs buying packs is one thousands gold and you get ten cards per pack which is well worth it and then to top all this off every single victory you make in ranked or casual play will reward you with some gold and a single card at the very least there a good chance you can get a card pack out of it i haven payed a single dime so far and i have a very respectable collection i only started playing a couple weeks ago the only real money you pay is for cosmetic stuff and honestly this game is so great and i appreciate the fact that it doesn't hound me to pay it money all the time that i will indeed give it some the deus have earned it the game looks and sounds great the card art is interesting the animations and sound design are really nice and the overall atmosphere is just enticing you to keep playing there are no bugs that i have noticed so far haven had a single disconnect or server issue its only downsides for me are constantly drawing mana cards can screw you over occasionally there are no reshuffling mechanics in place decks require you to have one mana card in every three cards which can expound the problem its not such a big deal though because this is something that can happen in any card game using mana cards the reverse can also happen occasionally its just luck of the draw rumour has it that applications that help you keep track of your cards can get you banned i cant confirm this but if its true its a bit of a head scratcher the ladder system needs a bit of a rework the game can harshly penalize you for each loss but you done get an equivalent reward for each win you can be winning more than fifty of your games and still not climbing the ladder overall though these are minor things in the grand scheme of things the game itself is amazingly enjoyable i highly recommend it to anyone interested getting in a new card game
i have tried a few racing games and sims race room seems a fairly complete package yes you have to pay for a decent amount of cars and tracks but overall the cars sound amazing and behave very realistic i do not recommend the keyboard but if you have a game pad or a racing wheel and you like racing sims go for it
early access review while this game has a promising core the deus are not making use of the potential it has lets get some pros out of the way rewards are generous and get you set up quickly game looks and runs well pretty good visual audio feedback on kill huge arsenal of weapons the shop is free of pay to win gear everything premium is cosmetic the core game play is solid and fast to pick up now for the cons map design is horrible demolition is the only game mode with serviceable maps and in being generous here weapon balance is bad thirty four assault rifles dominate the game with snipers following in their footsteps because of how easy they are to use the rest are just awkward gimmicky weapons to use if you really done car it has a csc style crate system that is somehow worse you need to open random boxes to get another box that you can then open with a paid key and get a random items memories except for tom and demolition are bland and rely on low effort gimmicks to make them unique they re dead for a reason tom is a spawn killing simulator ticket is a little lacking batt eye doesn't do much on its own there are absolute zero ways to communicate with your team because of no builtin void and the dead cannot communicate with the alive players radio commands are extremely limited and often misleading they done mark anything either so enemy spotted is useless the final nail in the coffin for me personally has to be that the deus show zero intentions to accept community feedback which means the game wont really have a chance to grow there are a lot of issues live mentioned that just require some updates and it will be perfectly fine but they done seem to be interested in this approach at all that be wiz for you the game is still playable but i wouldn't recommend it because of this problem alone
product received for free early access review you fight against higher levelled people and lose sometimes most of the time you get people your level though its a very annoying and time consuming like that friend you have otherwise its fine i just done like it
this is one of the worst racing games i ever played i believe that the physics are really bad and the graphics i had deleted the game after a certain amount of time the only good thing is that its free
opponent top decked a one mana spell that creates a random card from one of three factions in a massive card pool he had two crown of possibilities out he randomly created world bearer behemoth with killer and destiny ten do not play
the good free to play nostalgic relaxing the bad micro transactions seem to be required for some achievements to be completed in less than hundreds if not thousands of hours of game play difficult to get stop raider attacks achievements because all you see is death law attacks once into the game a bit you will never make the top lists on the leader board if you care about that for example i see people with over six hundred rooms you can to have over six hundred rooms there is not enough space overall very good free to play game
early access review for once an actual good battle royal game and its not so demanding like all the others that are being mainstreamed at the moment i can find myself playing this a lot solo or with friends only issue i have with this game so far is that there int other races like in the lore of paladins
early access review listen up this game is honestly one of the best battle royal games live ever played in my eyes the mechanics and flow of the game is everything pub should've been smooth firefights que times are amazing map is perfect size for a full lobby fun customization my only downside to this game is for them just to fix some minor hires and as well as adding a flipping shoulders function cause i tell you what only being able to look over my right shoulder has lost me many gunfights but i know they'll keep this game fun and entertaining final verdict eight thousand eight hundred and ten
early access review please remove or at least buff the goddamn chicken its just infuriating to not be able to get away from anything also the heirloom rifle is just aids its of overall just balance it more and its all good
early access review fun little builder basic digging game you can waste time playing alone but is most fun if you have a friend to play and build with worth a shot only critique right now is there not much to do if you get tired of building which has recently improved as there are now awesome free blueprints and somehow my avatar suddenly changed to male with no options to edit it but its worth playing if you like sandbox building games
mediocre yugo game clunky user interface rules are a bit different than the original i recall deck fields are much smaller way too many currencies and token in game played better version on goa
matchmaking for ground forces is abysmal i play battle royal four thousand seven hundred and sixty seven and in about ninety of all games as germany you will be up tiered fighting jag panthers with tigers and dicker maps fighting tigers and is with in panzer ivs this has gotten out of hand foreigner its time to get off your mountain of free to play money and start fixing your game for your players you lazy russians
early access review sigh how would i be able to explain how broken rob craft has become award pause well lets start with the pros based off center of match and science player made robot community factory to sell copy of your robot actual weight to blocks now on with the con there are a lot of cons but heres one almost everything let me explain i have played this game for so long and in disappointed about how much of a mess rob craft has become in sorry to say but i done like it anymore there are constant updates so that robot you just finished making the next day a update comes out and guess what that robot you spent five hours working on renders useless i created my bot many years ago and yet i didst even think about what i was building it was a burger coloured caterpillar i slapped some guns on it gave it some wings and am called it a robot but there is something a bit worse now balance the game supposedly says please wait while we match you fairly with other players that is a straight up lie you could create some high tech five are flak cannon bomber and be matched with new players its super unfair and it drives away players free am get yourself together and bring back tiers ever since free am introduced the community factory it has been a complete flop for me it meant the richer players could make their robots have a five star combat rating and make them even richer while those with limited funds are stuck with the lower star robots making little to no robots off their robots guess what the first thing you look for when you go to the community factory a good robot so rob craft shows almost only five star combat rated robots and only the rich can buy them leave the less rich to have to dig deep to just find a cheap decent robot all these robots are being sold for over a robots how are you supposed to make that much it seems the only way is to either churn out money for that robot or simply play match after match after match clan seasons are my main revenue of robots now your only choice to get that much is to either play for crates and hope you get good stuff to sell in the recycle or you have to cough up them dollar dollar bills to buy a ship full of platinum crates and sell everything you get from those crates i cant recommend this game until its more balanced and gives robots whether or not you win or lose a match seriously hey new players keep in mind rail and plasma for a win
this game is like having diabolo two with titan quest and other good stuff mixed with spicy passive talent tree giant spicy passive talent tree and color full gems of mass murdering bring friends
in filled with nostalgia when i go back to my very first trove club to still see it remain standing strong even though it is virtually dead at least i can see where we first plotted our spawn point the musical roads a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the clubs life time and numerous buildings that were once endeavours so many friends i stumbled upon during my activeness in the game i love building with my trove buddies more than that actual mining levelling up and staining bosses happiness filled my soul because of this marvellous game
here are things i like about this game complex strategy tons of unique tanks not a pay to win game occasionally gives free premium accounts can ram tanks to their death gets surprisingly intense in sometimes can snipe tanks from afar takes lots of time to go up to the final rank in still tier in great graphics feels very satisfying to destroy tanks would ram tanks again
early access review have been with this game from near the beginning and though i dropped out of it for a year it was still enjoyable then came the downfall i wouldn't say that the tier levelling update was part of the downfall but after that everything and i mean everything started to go to so especially the loot crate update and rob bits please just stop i miss how you could earn rob points from matches thus allowing you to buy more weapons and blocks but now rob bits only earned from a forge from destroying items hard worked for so free am i say this bring back the old rob craft at least until the tier flattening update please bring back our beloved rob craft
fractured space seems to consistently be referred to as a mob and while it technically is its sort of a stretch two teams face off trying to capture the others base that about it so far and is the essence of its mob classification that makes it a bit boring especially if the team you end on doesn't adjust their ships to complement the others that really the only negative i can see with fractured space which is a rather big deal since its pretty much the game mode you re going to play the other extras add up to make it a solid free to play game though at three thousand nine hundred and ninety nine to unlock all thirty one ships int outrageous and they go on sale for one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine from time to time the graphics are excellent and the added battle chatter from your crew adds to the immersion although i know millions of lives were lost to your incompetence every time i die i recommend fractured space since its free to play and you have nothing to lose
early access review seriously try the game out for yourself its actually good and the hate the game got early on want deserved the deus have been constantly fixing everything wrong with it so far and have already improved the game tenfold in the matter of two days its not pay to win in any way and the combat is actually engaging and unique done listen to the negative reviews because they re just not true try it for yourself and make your own opinion
early access review the first truly free to play card game on the market if you want a good magic style game to play then this is it whether you want to play by yourself against the artificial intelligence or play against others there always something for you to do to get more cards or play how you want its such that you want to give them money and support the deus because the product is so good and the game is more generous than its peers however because it is a magic clone and not like hearthstone even though the pictures make it out like it could be mana screw flood is always a possibly so losses could come from you having too much too little mana coming and vice versa still an excellent game through and through and i say everyone who likes this style of game should come and play it
i love this game it is exactly the kind of game that i have always wanted and its free sadly with every good there is a bad i can log onto a server and do amazing and get extremely good stuff when i decide that my bag is full with stuff i want i go to a settlement to place it in the safe when i do it either doesn't load it into the safe and it doesn't save it and disconnects me from the game or it will just disconnect me from it when ever it wants i have played a few games that were fine before this started happening and it was really fun now that it is happening i hope it gets fixed so that i can finally have my fun again
early access review its a fun game combat is great high end optimization is not so great but the game looks pretty good even at low settings it doesn't warrant the mostly negative reviews it has i will for sure be sticking around for awhile with high hopes that the deus will fix the issues the game has
looks good to damn hard to set up i have tried to setup the basic thrust master us joystick with throttle its just way to complicated and fiddly just as you thick you've mastered the basics something weird happens with views trims flight automation none of it makes sense it will appeal to a very small target market ill give it one more hour before i uninstall would not play regular enough to justify the cost of the downloadable content content what i would like to see is an even more dumped down version for newbies to flight sims and a magic button to setup joystick controls even loading a named controller from a database would be good it needs a of mode switch on login join game shoot stuff otherwise its just a flights there are no three week training courses to teach all the details of this game so many will not bother the guides are good but if you cant grasp the basics after ten minutes epic fail vote yes no her such yes just which is a shame as so much work has gone in to the game there are just to many hurdles to get you hooked
spend ten hours playing spent five got a random bod which deleted my save file and in turn the entire vault and all my time and effort done bother wasting time on this game when it will do something so stupid
i played this game during beta and recently got it on steam when it came out it was an insanely great game fun dungeons always something to do something new to grind towards without being to hard now you can grind for hours upon hours and not even get close to what you want the new gem system was good in theory but was executed poorly classes now cost real money to get really takes away from the excitement making everything unreadable has made it hard for new players to get a grip on things that maybe they cant farm or just done want to spend hours farming the lag has become almost unbearable beta had little lag now i cant climb a dungeon without rubber banding back down its frustrating overall if this game was its former self and easy one thousand and ten but now its a two hundred and ten
i love els word it is one of the best rugs live ever played add is so cute cd its really fun and the skills are really cool however i would not use real money on this i never buy things that cost cash in the game because you use them up quickly and they are expensive it is really fun though with all the things to explore one thousand and ten three
hmm best their is if you re like me who dreams of being in a battlefield when the suns goes down and at desert field near with guns blazing everywhere and lasers and tanks just having an orgy with occasional decked out battle bus with two gunners storming past enemy and lighting up anything it sees even its teammates looking at a gits
early access review in this newest update they changed this game from what it used to be a pay to progress faster and i paid some money on this into a pay to even have a little bit of success overall it is ruined with the latest major update go to geddit to see the full extent
early access review if you like smash bros you will love this game its much more easier to play with friends and you done have to come to each others houses its a very fun fighting game that my friends and i enjoy a ton and its free
early access review so far love it i played all the different artie games like dragon fable epic duel and of course adventure quest worlds whats been done so far in game perfectly matches the humour of the games and i cant wait to see what this game brings throughout development
it is fun to play even with the main aircraft you get its very realistic and i would recommend it for anyone who loves flight sims the combat is some what realistic and you cant throw the aircraft into unrealistic man overs
to it said i was disconnected from internet when i was not which used up my free entry into one of the battle arena and gave my opponent all the medallions i did not get a free entry back this game is to i do not recommend this game to anyone
this game despite being a massively multiplayer online type free to play with micro transactions blew me away the graphics are stunning the physics are very realistic the planes are beautiful and the combat environment is well balanced bravo to gan in here this is a truly beautiful game in my opinion the best part is that it if one wishes not to participate in the micro transactions it is possible to obtain just about all of the games content and actually compete by simply playing long enough which is better than many other free to plays out there keeping in mind that this game is still in development and balancing is constantly being reworked it is one of the best combat flight simulator games live played with the planned additions of playable ground and naval units it promises to be one of the best world war two combat games out there hey have you got to loose anyway its free go try it out its got a fifty five from me
if you want to play a mindless touch the screen forever app game then this is one of those i hate garbage like this its made for empty headed no gamers to waste time on their phones that it
early access review its a poor mans red orchestra that less user friendly and you have to rank up to play the real matches drive vehicles or get a gun that shoots straight for every faction us germany user granted it is early access so they could fix the confusing menus
early access review this is the first time i feel like writing a review for a game this game is awesome any hearthstone player will get into this pretty quickly but its way deeper and has some nice and fresh mechanics has several fun single and multiplayer game modes no restriction of farming in game money like is in general a way more generous free to play model tons of cards and its just in beta just play it
basic youtube watching sim min of queue time game play is amazing and fun not a copy or knockoff of min craft community is nice and helpful spam is almost nonexistent mining is not a grind process but rather a quick hobby every once in a while pay to win is almost useless as everything can be fairly acquired without intensive grinding for money game is fair as quests bosses enemies and all classes are balanced with only minor differences in unbalanced each class is unique and completely different and specialised deus are nice and try to fix queue times although they are totally inaccurate on the downtime guesses game is fun and is worth the queue times cant spell in sorry
pointless game get into combat get shot at through obstacles get killed right away one has to wonder is it cheating many ever into their rear take shots either bounce or no damage they turn around you are dead updates process is so complex obviously design to get suckers to spend but when it is all said at done the cheating and you inability to inflict damage makes you wonder why spend any money the cheating wont stop just because you spent money and the ramon effect of shots makes it pointless to even try give it a try but done get sucked into spending money its not worth it
product received for free you know it wouldn't be bad the launcher didst keep breaking when i download it through steam unfortunately i cant do it through steam because the game or the glyph launcher breaks every couple of days download trove from the trio website and forget about getting it on steam
early access review a beautiful and huge scale massively multiplayer online with nice of and weighty combat system higher quality than your typical previous asian mos with a much better story ore missions very traditional style massively multiplayer online with an upcoming action mode for the three none berserker classes buy to play and no sub needed especially when max level this games medieval style and castles also put any western and european deus to utter shame why is it this asian massively multiplayer online has more of a grasp of authentic medieval architecture than actual european deus now the voice acting in some areas is good but prob mostly poor and sometimes very laughable but as this and most asian mos are player versus player focused endgame should it matter too much in the long term
a solid and user friendly sim racing experience the free content might as well not exist there not much and i never liked it although objectively the quality is pretty good the real attraction is the paid stuff race room has some of the most diverse vehicle and track selections you have generic gospel several years of adam it watch and an exclusive atm license complete with all the tracks some open wheelers are available but the only notorious one is the do indy car aka for us most iconic tracks are included franc champs mona mola a wonderful rendition of the newburg ring nordic life and much more quality wise these are probably the best nonuser scanned tracks in the industry many more obscure venues appear too mainly in germany due to the atm license the physics are competent in not the most qualified person to talk about them but you definitely feel the motor engine underneath the force feedback is arguably some of the best and the vibration on the game pad is undeniably the best the artificial intelligence is very convincing definitely better than any other motor two title and maybe even better than factor overall very much recommended
static sounds of gunfire and artillery fire alpha get to a point bravo and charlie to left and right shield gens delta to the sci go go go slight delay of static explosions intensify in sound as the comm transmission fades out our in alpha your running with three of your squad mates who you've been through virtual hell with for the last two hours never backing down always getting back up they re your trusted companions on the minimal you see that there are enemy forces that greatly exceed your own you were given an order an you re going to fucking get to the point room if its the last thing you do you breach the door with grenade volley smoke goes up in scope sighted you breach kill screen minimal is riddled with the crossbones of your allies you spawn you grab a max suit a voice comes over the platoon communications seems like you guys really done want this base huh that of we can go back to the warp gate i guess this alert was nothing to you guys anyway sorry for wasting your time the voice ends into static your entire squad spawns next to you your entire platoon spawns next to you your entire platoon is now a mass of max suit you head to a point the voice of your platoon leader comes over the comes again good job guys now onto the crown time to do it over again but this time with a bit more spirit yeah names grow from the bottom of your left screen corner with your platoon roar issues of too data would fight again your first person shooter cannot do this mine can
live tried a few different mos and normally i burn out of them pretty fast tab targeting it center is not very engaging with never winter i find the game play fun enough that i have managed to level up to sixty our quite pleasantly i am a big fan of dungeons and dragons so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous forgotten realms setting the zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and i find the combat fun which is good because almost all quests are of the kill a monsters type i have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called anti micro which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller which it is designed for in any case sixty our levels in and live not spent a penny which is pretty good
early access review been a backer for a few years now haunt played in a long time logged on recently to see tons of old blocks gone my currency has been jacked up and i can no longer compete because my weapons systems are outdated in three days of free premium i got jack the new loot system is horrible and i feel like i have been ripped off they just want your continued premium money and money for stupid loot crates where a rust crate can give better gear than a paid for protium crate screw this developer they are just leaches at this point
early access review this game is a living testament that the pub deus are perhaps the most incompetent deus in history within months of development this game has more weapons better graphics and more items than pub sure its rough and clunky but i was just amazed how much is actually in this game pub deus just look useless compared to these other battle royal deus popping up there is zero excuse for them not to be dropping biweekly content drops whether its just a new weapon or whatever people deserve more for thirty bucks
exciting fast paced space mob that is third person you control a large ship with a fleshed out crew every ship is pretty well balanced from what live seen and most have a high skill cap some ships are simply better than others in one area but might be totally outclassed in another my paragon is effective mid close range but something like the colossus can often times rip me apart at that range knowing the enemy ships are very helpful in still pretty new but this game is probably going to remain in my library for quite some time friendly deus that still work on the game however they done really say what their patches are and appear silent on steam forums with an active official website forum however i wish people would actually use the chat function more
early access review it seems like it could be a quality game but i had a serious problem every button i pressed on my keyboard made me crouch down this was very annoying and i tried many things to help it but it made the game unplayable
plays like garbage personal computer runs it fine pcs jitter around just stand on top of a car and flashlight them to death didst bother with player versus player could be good not going to waste the time though
sometimes you will be walking down a hall and the hall will gradually get smaller and you will feel fear and it will be a horrific experience before the red man appears once the red man appears the only way to beat the game is to press est and the down arrow key and enter i won very easily
i played this game quite a bit back in twenty seventeen on the phone i have enough hours for this game to properly review it duel links is meh if you re a fan of yugo id give it shot the card battles are short and the music voice acting are top notch my issue is that its tedious requiring constant check ups to gain experience and money to buy cards by battling pcs the double edged feature they included was an auto feature that played for you while a cool idea and allows you to quickly take out pcs the game turns into an idle game another card game hearthstone makes you fight pcs and then throws you into the fray against enemy players to gain more experience the reason in bringing this up is because in hearthstone the fights are rewarding when you win against an enemy player i wish there was an option to fight harder pcs from the get go as the ranked play in this game is full of salt most fights have revolved around having certain cards with giant effects i remember one match where the dude already had three monsters out on the second turn and one of them could negate set trap cards and spell cards i could not find the motivation to continue learning about all the cards the game offers this game does have a few interesting mechanics when opening cards you can go through an entire box and get all the cards as long as you done reset the box if you pay a fixed price you can get all the cards in the box or go at it one pack at a time and still gain the cards i recommend not resting the box as it will mess up your chances you can also buy prebuilt decks to use the game also has a small pool of cards taken from each gen of yugo not like monster reborn or exod a so the developers do consider balance in some way there are multiple characters with different abilities to chose from which allows for a variety of benefits with your characters and cards my issue is that there is too many cards as of writing there are more than ten boxes to go through and all of the cards are usable in ranked play so you do not know what to expect when jumping in a match i also had my account deleted when i had this on my phone i had pegasus and quite a good amount of cards to play with what i liked voice acting music and quick battles what i didst like auto feature energy system tons of cards no locked meta
good game spend quite some time on it sofar and its enjoyable the quests are mostly normal massively multiplayer online quests kill ten a get three get center there are somewhat more story quests which involve some pcs saying things and some cut scenes pros free fun to play all classes offer something unique constantly being developed free expansions as far as i can tell once you hit level sixty a whole new world opens up cons bag space bank slot character slots all need to be bought without lots of grinding you cant compete at endgame with those that spend real money prices for basic things are a bit high its worth a try if you got time to spare this game can fill it
this sums up infestation pretty well quick analysis pay to win loot everywhere poor net code clunky controls up only at the moment too many other negatives to fit in here hilarious zombie shuffle might get better with more updates and more content whoever made this text image thing sums it up perfectly a a a a a a a a a a a of a a a a of a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a of a a a a a
planet side two on a planet with similar climate properties as earth there are three factions fighting over multiple facilities in territories regions in which they can annex and capture and expand their grasp of the surface area in these four continents that are snow desert forest and swamp like environments the game spans to thousands of people per server resulting in a massive battlefield atmosphere classes fleets of gunships convoys of tanks platoons of troops it center the game play itself is solid with bullet drop on many weapons and movement being comparable yet subpar for example you can scale sides of cliffs of infantry while standing on nothing but thin air but that doesn't bother me at all because doing that gives me an advantage for good sniping spots moving onto the dynamics this game is free play which is great having any one of my friends just hop in and play there are fifteen month memberships and bundles where the per month price decreases the more you subscribe and there is also the daybreak cash premium currency this is mostly useless unless you wish to buy decorative or arm or for your character and new camps but everything else that actually affects game play can be acquired by certs in game credit points for every two hundred and fifty experience you earn for the graphics and optimization of the game the game itself is poorly optimized but if you do run it at highest settings it does look pretty damn good on my gtd four hundred and sixty i ran it at straight up medium settings with about thirty five first person shooter but now with a gtd nine hundred and seventy it is absolutely amazing at max now to summarize this game up it is a must download and try out for sure diff the best mops live played and when it was first released in two thousand and twelve i thought it was ahead of its time and in some aspects it still is there may be a feel of repetition and grinding when you re playing by yourself but once you get a great group of friends going you'll find yourself putting countless hours into the game may
i spent close to half an hour tracking a hog finally found it got my shot lined up clicked and help i incur commits up apparently you have to pay real world money to be able to hunt some of the animals in the game
i start playing because most doer moved here but its kind dis pointing its visually overdone having hard time to see ourself or target during fancy animation especially in big party it should provide was setting rather than arrow keys only there customize setting for joystick but not for keyboard this game is not free to play a need to pay for second skill bar its cheap to buy only a ching i think be prepared to pay for the skill bar or just done waste or time in this game
i really appreciate that this game is free most of the amazing games live played are super expensive and the fact that this is free blows my mind it has a lot of features and stuff
a a a of of of of of a a a a a a a a a a of a a a of of of of of of of of of a a of in of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of a the a the a the a the a the a the a
early access review imagine making your reservation well in advance to the nicest steak restaurant in town when you get there you order the two charcoal grilled grassed rib eye with a rosemary sprig and melted blue cheese then thirty minutes later the waiter comes out pins your head to the table and takes a giant steaming hot dump in your open mouth before stapling a fifty five bill to your forehead done buy this
early access review a very good alternative to real mtg which takes full advantage of its digital format to do a lot of interesting stuff very gracious free to play model and the paid content is well worth it
early access review if you re browsing in recent reviews done bother with this game i wont even mention stuff like mana system because some people hate it some people love it rather its a prime example of pay two win model done trust old reviews saying it int it want always like this i have to admit i played it a bit during its early open beta it was harsh but a determined player could eventually afford a deck or two in the days when there was only the base set now there a basic set and three other sets with is cards each commons and uncommon are easy to get but every pack yields only one rare very rarely a legendary you'll get a few packs at the start and you'll get a pack from a latest set as a daily reward but there are lots of cards you will need keep in mind one thousand card pool and if you think you'll be able to craft legend aries i have some very bad news for you common card dusts for one shard and a legendary costs three thousand two hundred and you can have up to four copies of them new players may think this game is generous i mean you even get some paltry sum of gold and a common from every bronze chest you open this flood feels like you make a progress but the truth is your progress is equal to the amount of legend aries you own you may ask why do you need legend aries cant you use commons instead well legend aries have one of two things they either have a unique gaming inter ability no commons have or they re just a stats powerhouse or a mix of both to give you an example a common four cost in yellow has stats of thirty four and one minor skill the legendary four cost is fifty six it has one minor skill one unique skill no other common has to sum up you will never catch up to older players who played every day since early beta or donator i have to admit the game mechanics and card variety are pretty decent too bad all you can do is drool at the crafting screen if you have a spare five hundred to throw at the game feel free to try it if not then stay away i hope i will save your time May
early access review this game is amazing i highly recommend it for people who want a good free first person shooter game it is a lot of fun and very addicting i easily nominated this game for the game of the year award the game play in this game is a lot like counter strike go but there is team deathwatch and some other game modes like demolition in my opinion this is the best free first person shooter game ever made
early access review personally i did love the game but they decided to run everyone off by doing the dumbest possible with the latest update for example i now have an as load of credits that cant be spent on anything in the game all of my stats were completely wiped leaving me having to start over stat wise and i think the most change is that you cant complete phalanges without buying a new type of currency that cant be earned in game leaving you forced to spend money on to just to complete phalanges you ten cent you right in the eye with a goddamn chainsaw
nice game it is fun addicted it have cross platform support thanks steam and open source projects it could have auto moving cruise forward backward like in full world of tanks game or war thunder or armoured warfare it center it is low on performance impact great for mobile chips enjoy
when this first came to a i thought he i like this genre so ill give it a try i knew it was aiming to be a free to play game with an online store and that didst bother me the development was steady but not really all that fast again not an issue but the gametes didst seem to have a set goal in mind like so many games in this genre lately seemed to be more of a lets see what people want inside of min craft and then try to add that to our game but with less complexity flash forward lot of cosmetics lot of build options but not a lot of complexity sure it comes close but other recent games in this genre come much closer and look better to boot however since it is free go ahead and check it out just try to avoid spending real on it until you determine if you like it or not
so i thought id update my review since things have changed the positives of this game are in no order incredible optimization incredible graphics incredible attention to detail with the vehicle models not damage models though enormous selection of vehicles to play the downsides are foreigner are complete and basically the dying fetus of the user hard to figure out mechanics for a lot of things russian vehicles often have game breaking bugs or problems that benefit them that go without fix for months if it hurts them then patched in a day no russian vehicles have a game breaking bug that benefit them for a day before it is completely patched if it doesn't benefit them months on end no fix shells that russian vehicles done mainly use solid a ads mesh it center are under performing and unrealistic smoke launchers done work but you can use artillery which makes much more smoke as smoke screen atoms completely ruined what little balance there was matchmaker can be stupidly biased with one team stacked with eighty tanks and enemy team have seventy tanks basically a point pinata lots of prototype pay to win vehicles grind is in ridiculous repair prices are so bad that only the top three people on either team will earn money running good graphics is a disadvantage harder to see enemy in tanks lot of unrealistic maps and unrealistic situations for tanks beta game being used as an excuse for problems when it has content that costs forty in quid keep adding content without fixing content in game community is full of weeks i mean what the off with your anime fetish underage tank girls this is literally the reason germany started kicking off easy to exploit game problems lack of information in tank re makes it incredibly tense long winded and really hair raising compression at top tiers is so bad that less people play entry level jets and then foreigner compress it more to lower matchmaker times and then less people play aircraft below that aka foreigner just increase battle royal range and lower role play costs and these problems will sort themselves lots of arcade game modes for realistic tanks foreigner claim to have realism and do in a lot of aspects but will ignore the community with overwhelming evidence cough maps my front plate literally measured in real life with a tape measure and foreigner just in ignored it and left it at my and other times will change things in the name of balance instead of realism lots of german suspension is crap in game but there is a video of a panther rolling over bumps with no problem but in game you break and the entire vehicle wobbles for five seconds before the gun can be line up with the target awful tournaments which nobody played and ended up being money grab getting free content requires grinding off your entire life didst add ships despite leading the community to believe that they could play proper naval vessels and instead added boats because everyone wants to sail in rubber in dingy instead of has war spite british tanks were in boss and actually competitive when first introduced because of ads whilst it was maybe too powerful all solid rounds across the board were nerved so that british rounds are now not only laser pointers but cost silly amounts spelling doesn't exist and apparently a human in a tank is able to completely absorb a five pkg round travelling at fourteen hundreds is able to penetrate my of solid steel at pm yes ads has a you hit it you kill it policy with ammo racks so if you re off by pm then congrats that ammo rack survived and that so down the drain so to summarize its a good game with good qualities but its a grind and has extensive problems foreigner are so far up their own that they can taste their own tonsils and will never listen to community feedback lest it disadvantage their agenda good luck if you do try it though
early access review in not a huge fan of the battle royal genre however i can safely say this is the exception for me i started playing the weekend closed alpha started and i can see how much this game has grown since then as it is now its honestly a fun game to play in sure once it reaches beta or when its fully released it will be so much better
i enjoyed my time playing this it has pretty simple yet fun combat and when you a rent exploring the game world you can create your own you get a house you can bring with you to each world like a campsite that you are free to customize to help you out on your adventure which gives you a great chance to show off your building skills to other players this game is definitely worth checking out in a big fan of morphs and while i realize this style is a homage to min craft this style int really seen in an massively multiplayer online setting very often which makes the game unique since it is trying to make the vowel style appeal to a vastly different market its definitely worth checking this game out
feel like i just time travelled back to two thousand and fives when this game would have been classed as an average massively multiplayer online that what this game feels like on top of horrendously poorly optimized games make me feel very sad i hate wow with a passion but i think i would prefer to play that than this game
its a game on a computer but there a twist its a card game furthermore its only a god dang card game based upon an actual computer game but seriously its addictive first off but also amazing ugly frustrating build up mega hand to only be killed by one point card i keep playing it but never want to i hope this helps with your downstairs problems i like it i just done like small community that play the same game for three years so that to make me go two hundred and ten games we very much pay to win but you can tag along without i still put like
early access review its in open beta so understand its still in development however i love this game me and my friends are utterly addicted give it a chance i promise you wont be disappointed artie entertainment the developers are some of the best developers ever and take it upon themselves to interact with their players and update and improve their games weekly
perfect world entertainment presents how to bend dungeons and dragons over a table and pork it up the with a red hot iron poker gouging market pay to win shenanigans to small world and game cryptic seems to have really let we all over what could have been great
early access review feels basic and watered down i really like the forge and being able to do something with useless items weapons that you normally leave on the floor but its not enough to make the game too interesting jumping and vaulting also felt supremely clunky if you re not extremely close to the half all or window in question you'll only do a tiny hop
early access review overall rating seven hundred and ten for being an early access game this is pretty good i spent seventy one hours playing the game in one whole day and didst disappoint me at all except for a few minor issues forgiven for being still under development graphics visual rating seven hundred and ten pretty amazing and visual effects are stunning overall the graphics are good but it needs improvement as it causes major first person shooter drops even on capable pcs also needs more resolution game play rating six hundred and ten simple casual fun teamwork is essential core game play is solid and pretty balanced so far for an early access although it needs backstory to make the game more interesting do you recommend this game as of now yes this may change depending on how the game turns out after early access development if you somehow feel the urge to comment about my review please do May
early access review the graphics are okay but the controls i think are not so good the fact that you need to hold down the mouse button to look is a burden the attack buttons should be assailed to keys there should be keybinding for personal computer users there were instances where i was clicking on a enemy and my character was into a flipping frenzy it should be hack and slash not point and engage graphics are great though and humour is nice i think keybinding and voice chat are two things i will suggest and ditch the mouse hold and look design and just give it the hack and slash design a thirty five for me but will recommend as some might like it others may be disappointed a little May
done download and play it live played many hours of the infestation survivor stories classic and helped the developers backing it early when i bought three copies of the game two for friends in totally disappointed to buy a game from these developers they did so many mistakes and promises that has never been accomplished then live downloaded this free to play version to give it a chance but is the same old game but now for free it was a waste of time downloading think twice before buy a game from overpowered productions lac
early access review please done even consider this game as game its really not they failed everywhere with this garbage they brought it to us with improvement new combat and a lot more new quot but when early access came nothing they promised was there they said something like it was phase for development but that should be said before not when customer pays you already for something you cant provide after all of this to so many players left and refunded i stayed cut i believed that they can improve it so i gave them another chance believe me worst idea ever they didst improve nothing and after some time they made game cheaper for a little while and now they announced that early access was success and game will go free to play for real this my worst spent money ever never want to hear anything about be wiz company or people in charge of this crap thank you for reading and please done do same mistake like many of us
early access review interesting game combat is solid looks pretty would want to see some examples of different areas before buying not sure it will have much striking appeal in its current state having to spend more money on better ships ala free to play is a big turn off a tentative recommendation
early access reviewing been playing this game for a long time but unfortunately as time pass by the game just gets more worse now the game is pay to win also they have removed a lot of interesting stuffs like rob tiers tech tree role play and more stuffs to list done bother paying for anything either
if you didst start the game when it came out you re screwed any players joining either get disconnected from server or if you re completely new to the game you get killed by another player within ten seconds of spawning half hour twelve deaths later not a single life lasted longer than one thousand and fifteen seconds ill try playing another time when the game is a little better balanced for new players
early access review absolutely love the game i done know why so many of you are complaining i think the majority of you are just jumping on the bandwagon likes to hate on this game just because this int their first time of release i had no connection issues whatsoever or other issues the only thing that bothered me was the first person shooter which i believe will be fixed by the deus even so having four thousand and sixty first person shooter int a huge problem for playing a massively multiplayer online role playing game game its not a competitive shooter like counter strike go laugh out loud you either have a personal computer or a network done blame the deus my wifi is but the game runs just fine on a servers keep in mind that i am living in korea off the bandwagon losers
product received for free early access review eternal is a really fun game overall easy to learn and has a too on of lore now despite my thumbs up review there are a few glaring errors that prevent me from giving this a whole five stars some people on here complaining about the prologue tutorial i honesty blew through it and you can skip cut scenes shouldn't take too long also personally i enjoy larger decks test allows for one hundred cards i think it adds a lot of depth and randomness to your battle pros plays similarly to magic to and hearthstone tons of interesting lore with a fun backstory cut scenes can be skipped fun and enjoyable artwork on the cards a ton of game modes gauntlet mode is free larger decks with tools of card type variety free thirty packs with twitch prime cons forge mode costs crystals which you can get by winning online player versus player or you guessed it micro transactions i don't mind micro transactions but the only way to obtain crystals are through those methods player versus player servers are close to dead it takes longer and longer each match to connect with another player and when you do eventually get matched up they give you someone who is well above your tier i love a challenge but i was up against a three tier silver as a three tier bronze additional campaign modes can only be purchased through crystals and what money please read very important if you are to get anything out of this review be advised that there has to be something done about the inconsistent drawing of sigil cards they literally will cost you a game for example in one match every draw for five consecutive draws were vigils my opponent had a loaded field of creatures and i cannot defend or summon without creatures the reverse is also true i had one game where i barely drew any vigils causing my opponent to have thirteen mana and me to have six yes six i get that there has to be some strategy involved but this is just ridiculous i have upgraded my decks to the maximum capacity and still it seems off to me how are you supposed to defend attack with strategy with zero influence if i have zero cards in my deck and my opponent has thirty four creatures guess what ill draw three consecutive vigils its unfair and you cant really prepare for something that designed to screw with you its flip flopped every other game hearthstone test and mtg have this down to a science each turn you get aramaic whatever makes it fair follow their lead that about it overall really fun and tons of game modes however there are some rough patches
access review am really surprised about this the idea of fits really well into the game movement and weapon mechanics feel good not as arcade as cod but still no area realism a bit faster game play than pub long term motivation might lack a bit but i hope the will come up with new maps speaking about maps the current map is done pretty well far more details than pub and therefore a more interesting environment
laura clicker is a game where you click on the screen to reduce the life of a monster an anime girl dressed up as something until you defeat it it is replaced by another creature and you repeat the process gaining gold to buy allies who help deal damage to the monsters its an infinite cycle of the same thing the game even plays for you so you can accumulate gold even when you are not playing i kept playing wondering if there was anything else to it but there really int if you are into this kind of game maybe an appropriate game for cell phones good for you however most people will probably not find any joy in playing this
what some might call a spicy meme all a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a suffer
early access review in a veteran magic the gathering player who has played hearthstone since it was in beta and in switching to eternal that should be all you need to know join us
still the same old hack est it ever was the later you stay on more hackers arrive they will never get banned it sure is fun though i like playing it its a shame they still cant figure out that the hackers have always been what holds this game back
early access review the ships are awesome and have the feeling of being huge juggernauts without feeling sluggish the designs are original and very unique the game play is action packed and tactical this game will be something big one day in sure of it
after six hundred hours of game play with path of exile i still recommend this game to anyone who wants to start out the arg genre completely free and yes still better than the new released diabolo game immortal he he
a pay to win massively multiplayer online role playing game i tried it and has most stuff other morphs has special powerful stuff in a store with micro transactions a farm and many quests so far i only figured out to get one dragon and it is only teenager still i cannot even seem to chat in the game this game seems quite buggy for a massively multiplayer online role playing game
early access review this game is good there are hackers yes but in a game like this it doesn't bug me as much as a game like counter strike global offensive or co some guns need work shotguns need more damage six shots to chest to kill one person a as well as some of the assault rifles snipers are pretty balanced without arm or is one shot with arm or two shot unless head shot then always one shot the graphics are good for a free to play game its not pay to win holy a free to play game with no pay to win you can buy skins but they are just skins will make eight or nine hundred and ten if the guns are fixed and some form of anti cheat is added
this game is great but played it on my mobile for a year unfortunately the information int transferable which is plain stupid so that a vault completely full and micro transaction wasted playing again you can find it boring waiting for something to do
this game is so up you firstly have to create another account aside from your steam one them once you start the graphics are awful and then you have to pay real money to get more races and cars
live been playing this game for over two years now and have watched it go from or alpha to alpha to beta and if the developers keep the pace they have set with all of their updates and patches i have no doubt this will be one of the top independent online multiplayer games ever this game is consistently fun and intense enough to a way keep you on the edge of your seat while the game may seem like it is pay to win i do not think it will be like that once the game is officially released i just think it looks that way because the developers are just trying to get the funds to keep the level of quality they have established going May
pros nice graphics only fire int that good superb sound especially the sound of the jet engines sounds pretty realistic realistic game play yeah its not the reality but its more realistic than for example wot different game modes all none game no extra download to play ships for example cons sometimes the balance happens when new vehicles are introduced but will be worked on long grind effects doesn't look good the mentioned above fire
early access review sorta like if magic hearthstone had a baby free to play has been very generous its too hard to catch up to hearth and magic without a large investment now whereas feels like you can get in at the ground level on this now and wont have as hard a time collecting all the cards you need to create interesting decks
no like honestly this game puts kane wests face to shame it made justin cry his singing career off and my grandmothers porridge puked from seeing it in just horrific like no in done screw this there was even a man named black jesus in done
early access review so when you hit soft cap there will be no promoting content no arenas or battleground no player versus player ranking system or ranking reward honor point acquisition is broken basel canyon main player versus player map is empty no mobs levels for unlocking last two stances and trait points are not implemented cant progress past skill gem acquisition is broken no mira burris hard mode or whatever name they gave it in our version two end game dungeons with exactly same gear score drop no royal quest no honor quest no daily dungeon
early access review this is one of the best games live played on steam i love the specialities with the different classes and how diverse each match is you never know what to expect live played a few matches i won once and it is very satisfying totally recommend
i have played this game for around two months now and have thoroughly enjoyed it it can be a bit of a grind at times but what free to play game int it seems to be a much fairer and overall better version of hearthstone which i also spent many months playing you get good value from the arena the story mode is something special which i done see in many other card games and the rune system makes it possible to win even when behind if you get some prophecy overall would rate it a solid nine hundred and ten
this game has its good fair of ups and does pro simple graphics horrible range quite saggy at sometimes fps cap no story stupid dec broken spawns sometimes you will fall through the void and lose your stuff when you load up a world this game is just like my has no protection from hacker broken pc that can hit you through the walls so i say this game is a six hundred and ten and i give it this rating because there needs to be more added like protecting to the game and lots of bug fixes deus if you are reading this please listen to me and add fix these things thanks for reading
i have been around since beta and plays on multiple platforms i have a off hours made into this life elder scrolls legends are like weed you cant get enough once you get into est hearthstone will never be the same again delete delete est is the card game made right only ring you find in this game is from the chaos arena the gold limit is so much off work thirty wins and a single match can last up to thirty minutes with a solid deck so you are lucky to get to the limit and receive the persistent title no money needed to win personal i am soon eighty nine to complete my card collection with no real money used but i think the system requirements are misleading coz you ray need a brain to win in the long run may you walk on warm sands and may the fates smile on khan it may
early access review most people when posting reviews rant on about how its good and bad in just going to say you need a beastly computer to run this game but its total worth it
i decided to ignore everything that went on with this game so far and give it a shot heres a description of my twenty minutes in more or less game the game opened in three windows and crashed started the game again created character played the tutorial character got frozen fighting a dummy retarded the game got through the tutorial quest pc didst spawn restarted the game game loaded pc spawned mouse cursor did not restarted game loaded pc spawned mouse cursor loaded got quest entered cinematic game crashed uninstalled during the rare occasions when everything worked the game was extremely saggy and controls absolutely unresponsive just save yourself the trouble
early access review how the hell is the reviews mixed this game is trash complete trash paying money for this is the worst mistake i have ever made do not buy this garbage game
trove is a great game it has a bit of stuff for nearly everyone from gardening to ring rafting to levelling up trove also has many mounts pets a few boats and sails and mag riders it also comes with many biome and classes in my opinion trove is a great role playing game but that just my opinion
so i am assuming you re one of those people that saw this game and thought of that looks cool to play with friends and have a bit of unwell if you are one of those people stop stop thinking that right now if you honestly like this game and have played it before and can handle the terrible controls and stupid commentary and foolish music choice then congrats you are the spawn of satan and everything unholy but if you are a first timer and have never played this before thinking it looked fun well its not its a big pile of steaming crap sat on your doorstep ready for you to unknowingly stand on it when you step outside your door then the smell just lingers like a virus and honestly you regret all the decisions you have made in your life and want to go back to the womb and start over the three is only there to make the creators feel good about themselves in some sort of way
it great game everyone should play even though what a level you will get better weapon and go to new world that are available so i great game and i hope developers make a good game like this a
received for free early access review the amount of data collection in their privacy policy is beyond egregious now i see why this game is free this is just another example about tech companies trying to profit by taking advantage of their users and they should be ashamed i understand desiring to use products in some cases despite overreach of the company in question but we as users cannot tolerate and support behavior like this if you value your own privacy or anyone else
early access review skin uses a gem in a world is very stupid do seriously this game is trash so you know what you should do rate it as bad and delete it and you could also write a review like this one
early access review tried to like this game i tried so hard to like this game but i cant think of it like this its planet side two but in a wii setting so if you hated pm you'll hate this game as soon as you hit rank three with any faction you get completely de by the game matchmaking suddenly becomes a broken mess people are on showing you from across the map with tanks you get bombed on by planes who fly so close to the ground in reality the bomb should have blown them up as well you cant do because your being spawn camped you shoot a guy three times in the torso with a semiautomatic rifle only for him to one shot you with a bolt action act act as soon as i hit rank three i was like alright i can drive tanks i can do assault maps yes i was playing as an american soldier and the first tank they give docent even have a in cannon on it no it has two useless mrs on it that cant do to other tanks why the would you give us a tank that you cant even fight other tanks with it whats the in point of a tank if it doesn't have a cannon on it it might as well be a slow jeep with two mrs on it at that rate not to mention that each my can only move one hundred and eighty degrees so to aim at someone to your right you got a either hope you have a gunner with who or you gotta turn the clunky piece of around and by that point your blown up did i mention matchmaking holy it gets so broken when any faction gets to rank three tired of being an american soldier who rank five go switch to your german solder who rank one whoops put you in a game with a bunch of ranks have fun i should probably mention you have to rank each faction individually but for some stupid in reason as soon as one faction reaches rank three the other two factions get the benefits of hitting rank three even though they could both be untouched because everyone ranks on their own you have to deal with the starting equipment and ribbons and medals all over again with each faction only adding to the grind this game presents this may be because in not a patient person to begin with but this game is so in broken due to its matchmaking and utter grind ness for each faction that i cant recommend this to anyone unless you played this when it first came out and you re all geared up and whatever get ready for this game to shove a ten foot pole up your and then shove a twenty foot pole into your while the ten foot pole is still in there May
digital combat simulator world is the greatest and most realistic combat flight simulator out there but when is says free to play and yet costs one twenty five thousand six hundred and fifty six with all its downloadable content i done know what the your talking about have a joystick have a tracker or erik or better real video cargo danger one
early access review fun game i have a day played twenty four hours its a grind to be able to get the best gear but when a get the best arm or and weapons it is so worth it zero recommended for a good player decent computer needed
early access review may not have played a large amount of the game but i feel live played enough to give an educated opinion i tried the game in hope of finding a sort of world war two themed battlefield game as it promised large scale vehicular combat i was then saddened when i realized that the only combat i would be seeing is tiny skirmish battles with civilian trucks in place of the large panzer tanks id hoped for but before even reaching combat i had to tackle the load out menus which are utterly confusing and drastically over complicated and lets not forget the propaganda for buying premium currency eventually i gave in and began to enter the skirmish battles with my new us character this i regret i took up position behind a rock and began firing away at the grey green enemies against the grey green backdrop i stared down the useless iron sights which obstructed my view more than aided it and fired a round at an enemy that was closing in hit however i was utterly flabbergasted when the enemy retorted with a barrage of bullets from their machine gun i was chopped down in a matter of seconds questioning how i could fight these bullet spewing monsters i continued the cycle spawning firing a measly few bullets before being destroyed by those blasted machine guns the battle then boiled down to a relentless spawn killing and needless to say i was on the receiving end frustrated by my beating i navigated myself to the shop in search of my own machine gun i then had to pick my jaw up from the floor once i saw its price tag but rest assured you could easily purchase it with some premium currency against my instincts i grinder enough money to buy another american rifle this one a bolt action as i wished to begin sniping if the starting rifle was bad then this one must have been the worst it traded the semiautomatic fire rate of the starting rifle for a measly damage increase and even worse iron sights meanwhile id also unlocked the ability to finally engage in the actual battles the game advertises it was nothing like what id hoped instead of being able to partake in ordered offensive and defensive battles i was greeted with the barrel of some high rank tank controlled by a guy ten times my level and to make matters worse if i dodged the tanks then i would surely have my brain splattered by some grey blur of a sniper on a hill at the other end of the base and this is where i uninstall this game to summarise the games concept is brilliant however it is delivered so poorly i wish id never been tempted into downloading i appreciate that the game is free however it is heavily unbalanced and easy to skip to the top of the leader board if you've got the dough for it of and also the vehicle controls are so clunky and unresponsive you could brew a cup of tea by the time your bicycle makes a right turn that is unless you a rent blasted apart by any of the methods listed above i would recommend this game to nobody other than those who prefer to buy prestige rather than earn it maybe you will squeeze some fun out of this game but i for one will enjoy all the saved storage base this game once occupied May
early access review the graphics are really dope and well optimized the game play is clunky and the men settings are lacking but that to be expected of a strange humorous theme of men in their underwear with cooking utensils for arm or and world war two guns kind of bizarre limo but okay why i disliked the game game launches in a separate application when the match starts so that three apps a launcher a menu and the actual game running do the deus not know how to put together a game next the client runs in the background it launches when you start up your personal computer so i assume it installed some unwanted registry key that i didst give any consent to finally my desktop completely froze up when i switched windows to start up a recording the cursor was locked in place so i couldn't do anything and alt tabbing caused the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen forcing me to reboot no thanks done want to deal with that again especially since i was in the middle of backing up data when it happened
early access review this game runs and play well from the little amount i have played it is incredibly enjoyable far more enjoyable than pub but sadly the good comes with the bad if you run this game in an account that is not administrator you will likely run into issues with steam apr failed error message upon boot up
early access review this is like a terrible version of call of duty now live never played call of duty myself but let me tell a something i have a friend from my church that plays the game regularly and he is pretty good at it and i had him play this with me he said it was the worst piece of he has ever seen i agree with him not only is this game not worth the web page its printed on the prices a way too high the gun a very inaccurate the hit boxes a and the first person shooter is horrendous never in my life have live seen such a bad excuse for not only a game but something that in its review said it was support to be better than call of duty and battlefield well let me tell a something whoever it is that created this game get a real life a absolutely suck at war game and would better off going back to your worthless mon and breastfed a little longer you in worthless piece of
as you can tell from my hours i have played this game quite a bit in gonna go for an unbiased review of this but it may end up being a tad bit biased without me realizing it without further ado in gonna just jump right in pros one fun but occasionally repetitive game play two decent graphics and visual effects three really nice character design and backstories four great diversity in combat styles for certain characters cons one slightly pay to win two certain overpowered classes looking at you car and die three terrible economy four moderately buggy at times five the majority of the player versus player community is bad this one is a bit of a gripe but it still remains true these sum up most of the major points but there is a lot more to go in detail about first things first if you wanna play this game seriously its pretty much unavoidable to not spend money at some point it wont be too much but the major thing that locked behind a pay all is the skill slot change medal when you start out you only have four skill slots and getting that medal unlocks the other four its nine worth of ching to buy it and even though you wont need it for some the majority of classes benefit greatly from it with some needing it as a necessity there are some events that will give you a free permanent medal but those done happen too often so you would probably end up waiting several months for one of those events besides that there nothing else you need to spend money on although its pretty obvious they made the skill quests extremely grind to push you towards just buying the skill you need instead of doing the respective quests for it the quest for most second job changes takes quite a bit as well taking as long as a couple of weeks for people who play casually note this does not include all second job changes quests as for the rest of the game even though there are some negatives the game play makes it worth it its really fun to play and even though there a pretty sharp learning curve that happens around level forty six that what makes it fun even replaying through the various areas as different characters levelling them up can prove a completely different experience depending on which classes you've played already graphics soundtrack game play bugs overall verdict even though there are some definitely noticeable flaws the pay to win factor int too high and its worth at least a shot in my eyes may
early access review so the title doesn't make a lick of sense not really and its basically a carbon copy of pub but its got snowboarding and nifty graphics that a rent too animism for what should be a generic cash grab chinese battle royal clone the weather and mobility twist makes it actually insanely fun plus rendering is fantastic if you re good enough you can snipe someone clear across the map with the right vantage point the helicopter thing for four people is pretty pointless because everyone just camps the helicopter and spams me packs so its still basically last man standing other than that this is a good pub knockoff that i find myself playing more than pub itself heres to a good game before the inevitable pay to win cash shop that i just feel will eventually show up one day
a very solid eight hundred and ten would give it one thousand and ten but i just thing there is much more the could be done like making small towns with pcs and maybe some will have a little quest like bring me this and you will get this in return but overall very good game
god damn this game the game is just not worth its time there is no fairness in this game the chances of landing on the aspects you want are super slim therefore the other team always lands on the thought you done want this needs to be changed there needs to be better probabilities in this game sorry but its not worth your time playing this game i like the aspect of the game and concept the other side takes over thank you for reading this feedback hopefully no one takes it personally
this is getting annoying i really would like to play this game because i know a few people who have recommended it however whenever i try downloading the game it will install download the game package as if it was about to start and then crash my computer shive tried this four times now off the website and steam download what is the a problem
early access review think the spookiness thing about the game is the pants all consuming anxiety and stress that comes with encountering and trying to escape from a monster by the time i got to the last rooms seven hundred i was a deadened hollowed out shell of my former self sprinting through rooms and barely registering when something was chasing me would play again
early access review its a great game for only being in its alpha stage to those of you who are complaining about having to wait five minutes for something to be mined whf goods this game takes hardly any time compared to many other games that make you wait hours or even days for items to be crafted this is a fantastic game and has much more working content than i expected for a game in alpha fantastic so far and keep up the good work deus
this game is not free to play its just a highly restricted and limited demo version and should not be allowed to be sold under the argument of free to play the content you can enjoy without a subscription is maybe five of the game a no
how to get your life back go to help click on steam support go to recent products click on laura clicker click on permanently remove game from my account warning the game still shows up under recent on your profile so you might want to binge play some games to hide this at the bottom of the recent list
simply put everyone right the game is you get like car and one map for free controls are atrocious and you will find yourself crashing often free to play pay to win free to play pay to win though i done know how anyone can win with controls like these get this crap off my library
early access review everyone can enjoy this game it doesn't take much to get used to it and play decently well enjoy the grinds and the fun battle matches of and its not pay to win but skins do look damn good hama
the game try to keep you playing by making one of the guns available to buy with the currency you earn from completing missions when in reality there are not enough missions to be able to get enough currency to buy the gun if you re wondering why i wouldn't just use another gun it is because you have to use the gun to tag rabbits
updated two hundred and forty one thousand one hundred and eighteen its been a while and re is still utter that sums it up if you re an old rob craft two thousand and fifteen fan for the love of god stay away from this game done be fooled by recent reviews saying the tech tree is back it center its hardly like the older one the equivalent to tier ten games are nothing like what they used to be tom is a re spawn fest with everything dumped down and sped up there no team play whatsoever because re spawns and self healing are a thing so medics are completely redundant absolute waste of your time if you decide is try this again older review ask me for a review on this before re spawned and overclocked update three hundred thousand four hundred and fifteen i would give this a positive review but after re spawned and overclocked update that a whole new side heres why before re spawned and overclocked this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode once dead you re gone once they introduced medics it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together moreover when free am released the team balance patch the battles would last so too much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldn't be paired with five other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of sub machine gun tanks as medic you would feel so valuable one of my favourite memories megabits arrive some of the player base decides this was a bad move this was where the game started to get controversial however in my opinion this was even better because now the to would stick by the vegas siding them in one big turf war those were the good days of ruth of april arrives re spawned and overclocked the danger of dying now gone stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using try forcing act team work is gone no need to stick together if you die you can just re spawn again done even get me started on medics before re spawned and overclocked medics were the top priority on kill list but now they re just replaced with re spawn again no fear of dying megabits are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new re spawned and overclocked the megabits were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned even though arena mode is still here it feels as if it gets no love anymore rob craft unleashed touches down the removals of tiers and tech trees are here this resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that its no longer the case in addition going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression i can see free am wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just wont work to some prob craft used to be one of my favourite games and was a fun and enjoyable game simple and easy to learn however as the updates passed rob craft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed mob style game is if you read all of this thanks for your time april
survival mode is the only setting the game was men to be played at yet major flaws exist that greatly hinder the players progress even if you bought in game items to help the disasters spread too fast i had a fire start in an empty room but with a dweller on the other side of the freaking bulkhead say five steps yet it took less then two seconds for the fire to cover three rooms this is because they want you to pay for tools items that specifically deal with the flaws they purposefully throw in the game send problem is the horrific a i where do i start you cant tell if a female is peggy because the level up icon takes up all the room moving dwellers from one room to another is pain staking the outlined box you hover the dweller over is way to small and out of place completely when viewing from a slightly higher or lower perspective this is also true for when you need to view a dwellers stats but done want to level him or her up even clicking below their torso still triggers a level up the dwellers will stack on one another to fight making it impossible to check their condition most the pets suck or handy will move in front of your tools you cant be away from the game if you send your dwellers out for more then hrs endurance is useless the difficulty stops increasing around population of forty five death laws are not as bad as fires believe it or notice also played this on my phone samsung galaxy seven nine i forget but it runs like molasses after one hundred and twenty people god help you if you spent cash on this trash me included he just the starter pack you've tricked me this time bethesda five hundred and ten stars i still haven touched your massively multiplayer online though hah
you can have a panther tank may you can shoot at planes with your panther tank may you shoot them with your panther tank and at best they start smoking may they bomb you once and you are dead a the enemy pilots can be fast as sloths and still destroy uranus may have fun
early access review this collectible card game is similar to hearthstone in the collecting aspect but similar to mtg in the combat aspect it int a one sided snore est with no interaction its got interaction on both turns a growing card and player base and some of the most generous reward structures in the collectible card game industry the tutorial is a little over an hour total played time but it gives decent rewards forty five hearthstone two hundred and fifty five mtg thirty five
wow alright so all in all a horrible experience first off i try and quit a server and get a disconnecting soon while waiting for over ten minutes get killed it has happened twice now and lost a couple of decent skins because of it
in short the games matchmaker is very unbalanced to put it in perspective most of the matches i have played i took my tank that was developed at the end of world war two one hundred and ninety four thousand four hundred and forty five out in a match and was put up against cold war tanks also getting new vehicles without premium and in some cases with premium takes an ungodly amount of time the only way to effectively grind out a new tank is to purchase a premium account and play a premium vehicle of the higher tier if you done spend money you re ten steps behind everyone that does
this game is incredibly up the free version is more like a demo to get you into the game this is one of my favourite games play the tutorials and maybe even play with your friends and you will know if this game is right for you this game is worth every single penny in my opinion is quick download what do you have to lose
early access review first off i would like to say that this game has among the best community of players i have ever encountered online everyone is super helpful and nice very collaborative and community oriented lets keep this trend going now this is a sandbox games am absolutely loving this game its addicting and rewarding everything about this game is fun to do a brief overview of the game you start off in a random location on the world map which currently there are only four variants off which is unfortunate but hopefully soon they will be procedurally generated you have a twig with which to hit things to kill them and harvest their loot and a basic mining core gauntlet you go kill piglets boars leafs things of that nature to collect hide tusks sinew bone it center as you travel you can collect the trees dirt water honey it center in order to upgrade your mining core build up your core mine around explore fight things collect flowers mushrooms make a forge and processor create arm or and weapons other neat things furniture what have you mining ore in this game is different instead of clicking on it and standing there until you pop it you place an extractor on the ore node which will harvest it for you giving you time to go and look around for more ore while it processes come back and poof there twelve coal ore or obsidian or what ever it might be its a very interesting take on it and its a lot of fun well anyway in rambling on about nothing but its a lot of fun and its still in early access tons of fun and immense potential overall rating of also if you are crying about the game having a price tag now get over it grow up get a job its twenty bucks that like what less than two hours of work i see so many people complaining about how they ruined the game and made it pay to win it int you can either a pay nothing and experience one hundred of the game or a pay the nominal one time fee of twenty bucks and get a bunch of goodies and be able to create multiple worlds and also help fund the development team for more updates in the future stop being so entitled to free stuff this real life money doesn't grow on trees nothings ever free
early access review avoided this game people kept telling me to get it and i wouldn't as the pictures looked crap and it looked like min craft someone wanted me to record with them so i got the game and i can say that i really really love this game it can be so addictive but all depends on if you sort of like things like this i am not that keen on min craft which this game is very much like but i have to say its so much better than min craft and there is so much to do you done just craft something and that is it you find something to craft but before you learn how to craft that item you have to find items for the recipe but some of the items you need you have to learn to craft them as well very complicated to explain in writing than it is in the game laugh out loud but it goes in a circle so much more to it wonderful graphics creatures are amazing you can tame them and then use them for certain items you can spend hours and hours on this learning all the items to craft building a base taming searching for different biome this game could be so much more popular if it came onto box or playstation four and i could see it being on pads it would appeal to young and old you wont know if you will like it until you get this game
while i greatly enjoy playing the game i cant recommend the game for anyone who either has an addicting personality or doesn't have the funds to regularly drop a couple one hundred on the game yes while you do get the occasional free gem its nowhere near enough to sustain being free to play the meta changes rapidly and if you want to keep up you re gone either have to open up your wallet or prepare to be destroyed in player versus player matches is players that have decided to spend the money the game play is great and the skills are a fun twist to the game but sadly this is yet another game that was done in by kong is seemingly endless greed
early access review awesome game basically magic the gathering through and through but without the user interface issues that magic duels has also way better than hearthstone and in probably the biggest blizzard fan girl in the world one thousand and ten
early access review ont even bother with this hot garbage years of anticipation and the best artie entertainment can offer us is a crappy mob age which just happens to be playable on personal computer sound is sorely lacking there are no noises for navigation through venues the launcher is entirely silent and bland second soundtracks play once when entering into areas not the tutorial level though which is about as silent as the aforementioned launcher crappy full screen functionality image is always rescaled interior resolution of in game resources seem to be inconsistent and i haven been able to get a no stretched loading screen utilises a premium currency system as the rest of their games have in impressed they had the tenacity to come up with this kind of stuff since before the release of the iphone minimum expenditure of five with crappy starter items right out of the first real area of the game being sold at a value of around two of those five dollars game play is absolutely shallow victory is only determined by your level and how many of those cent potions you happen to have on hand camera is hard to manipulate it snaps to the direction the character is facing during movement and appears to be optimised for touchscreen interfaces ugly user interface need a loading screen to talk to pcs that all fail a decent amount of the time i didst play this for long so there no telling how many other things live missed
early access review the last update just made the game so bad because those reasons money has no value anymore the game now its about your luck if you were lucky you get legendary the lucky players can get more legendary weapons because they always win and top score so they keep get the best the new players can reach high lvi fast if they are luck please make the game what it was before
it was such a fun game early on i had an issue when i paid for an alpha game and then it went free to play didst play for quite a while i went back today and the player base is gone sad because it looks like the new coop missions look awesome but didst have the patience to wait for a game that long its free so go ahead and try it maybe certain days have more players it really was fun i had way more than ninety eight hours that must be after launch
early access review really great game from the limited amount of time i played of course its similar to min craft int that the point why have only one min craft when you can have a hundred varieties and choose the you like best its like cheese you might not like blue cheese but love gouda you re still eating cheese and both are one hundred viable pros textures are great models are cut crafting system easy but fun the sky looks awesome cons i had some saggy movement if you re septic about this game give it a go even if you wait til its free to play for some of us its definitely worth it
early access review loved adventure quest worlds it basically got a huge upgrade if you play adventure quest worlds and want something with bit of a change of pace while keeping true to the game this is the game to play
live sunk a bit over four hundred into the game help edit game now includes essentially malware each if you are concerned about your privacy done play this each does not actually do anything it is easily bypassed and it just bans normal players because their drivers look a little strange look at for honor
well this game used to be very fun and very interesting however the recent changes to the economy including the tie research revamp have caused the people i play with and myself to stagnate horribly now i feel like i am not getting any closer to a mightier fighter that is because i am not on average i have received about five hundred points towards a new plane which costs about one hundred and twenty thousand that about half a percentage granted before the experience points system was flawed similarly but you unlocked every plane for a level once you levelled up and there were times when i got one billion twenty thousand experience points so now i have to play approximately four times as many games to unlock just one plane not to mention i then have to pay for it with lions the games currency so while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same more or less after about tier three the game becomes an unbearable grind so if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours feel free and obviously there are casual options however i would suggest purchasing premium eagles or waiting until they fix the economy
games not balanced nor historically balanced so why go a a historic unbalanced path community is awful community manager falsely advertises packs with bad wording and contacting support does nothing but will forward message to deus its been almost a year now and nothing heard back feel scammed either bad net code or majority of the servers being in eur or re allows for hit shots to not really hit game is very grind unless you buy at premium vehicle premium i said forget it for tank the game has a lot of potential but theirs too many glaring issues such as balance to make it worth the time to play majority of new players wont see it until they get a lot of hours in and i done blame them i thought the game was amazing at first too this was years ago
done let the steam hours deceive you i have played over a hours of this games started playing poe on the ninth of february two thousand and twelve at that time the game was in closed beta it was hard to get a key to get in live been playing the game on and off ever since first id like to start with some pros and cons unlimited replay ability insanely fun difficult to master very good economy system it pays off to play with friends well made de sync starts off slow if you re a beginner the game is very big it consists of three acts featuring three difficulties plus an endgame map system with a level cap of one hundred it even comes with races and recently they've included special leagues with special formats and gimmicks that the normal standard and hardcore versions done have the game features one of if not the biggest passive tree in all of video gaming it is a very big thing its what makes path of exile what it is all of the different combinations of skills and passives you can do is endless you will never do every single combination skills a rent granted through the tree skills are given to you using different gems which are given to you through completing the games storyline and finding them by killing things the economy system of poe is very interesting it consists of orbs that you will find while killing things these orbs are the currency for a list of all the currency click here we path exile com using these orbs you can trade for different items with other players as well as with pcs inside of the towns or your own hideout well how does egg make money of this game egg makes money by their fantastic micro transaction model it is all cosmetics with some continence items stash expansions these are a great way of supporting the game if you dislike the cosmetics the game is hard its not easy to play and its definitely not easy to adapt to the de syncs and such you will your first character up i recommend visiting the poe forums at first and finding a build labeled cheap and then following that for your first character playing with friends definitely pays off as it makes the grinding a bit less tedious and it generally makes the levelling phase a lot more enjoyable the game even gives you a fifty increased drops per person in your party overall the game is a lot of fun with very few flaws biggest one being the de sync but if you enjoy playing areas or if you disliked a this game is definitely worth trying out and if you never have played before done play on standard its practice the dumpster of all leagues february
early access review this was a great game until the loot system was introduced why for one they took away the level lock system which made everything fair now some level one can get an incredibly over powered weapon but still be matched with bots around his cup secondly there is no more economy to this game the idea was completely scraped the economy made it fun because i could buy whatever part i needed to make my dream bot come to life now its hoping i will get a decent part that i can actually use on my bot thirdly the premium system doesn't work well with this update there not much there to pull you into buying it i either miss four extra parts from a or one extra part from deathwatch these are just my opinions but they truly did ruin a great game and a lot of my friends have stopped playing update i know a lot of popular games like laugh out loud and such are adding crates or similar mechanics to the game but if you've actually noticed they haven thrown their whole economy done the drain the crate mechanic is a separate feature that player can do if they desire to also it wouldn't be that hard to bring back that good old levelling scheme and still having a crate mechanic all you would have to do is literally just limit what the lower levels can get it really int that hard to do in really just sick and tired of seeing low levels being able to two shot each other it takes away all the fun
warning long post incoming first of all in game description they say thousands of players in my opinion there are about twenty five hundreds players active in every thirty five battles you start noticing the same names in the list when i started playing the game there was player counter showing kkt online players as soon as there was eight thousands and lower developers removed the counter i wonder why i have played the game over several years about fourteen hundreds hours in steam and even before it came to steam i have seen many updates many hot fixes and nerds i can say that this game is dying developers are not listening the community developers done really know what they are doing best example creating tons of skins over fifteen years and yet not a single new assault map developers are allied biased us a us and taking things personally when someone is a dressing questions about german faction nazis and the biggest of up is the one hundred and twelve update the developers rushed in unfinished unpolished unreal the last update is the reason for this review till this point i hoped that game is getting better but i was mistaken only reason why this game is still alive is because its free developers fix your game and listen players who have at least one thousands hours of game play in their account

nothing fun in this game anymore between the try ards and hackers just remember days just could get on pub server and just have some fun now of days is just stress to keep up with all this try ards is sad cause game itself is fun it has good environment with color full characters but all this for nothing as player base get more and more touch on combative play and this once play ground have become serious sport as it is i cant recommend this game any players just wise have fun cause just get beaten up by players take this game way to seriously i problem come back ones and while play but not cause reason i enjoy myself but the maoris i have get me coming back to it when this game was bit more for me and less for people done know different between work and play
in broke i spent all of my money on nonexistent hats to wear while being ruthlessly spawn camped by snipers my team is always full of gib swearing provision scouts i have five man versus machine vouchers yet no tour of duty badges because my team always goes full sniper and spy and one pro i cant enjoy the sounds of my characters pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears live gotten into arguments with nine year old about who has a better beard which doesn't exist this is my favourite game of all time one thousand one hundred and ten
there was a deer hunter game back in twenty tens i played it was much more better than this crap there is no vehicle to use here no rewards your game paying membership to buy licenses really the do you think this is real life
early access review beautiful idea okay concept but all that running just to be sniped blown up by a tank that your team has no means to destroy or shot by a camper because he and their team in general lack the incentive to defend attack a position just kills that game play expect many one sided games game play that consists of running and wondering where you are and a lack of any weaponry that can actually kill someone accurately the higher level guns will instantly kill you bow done get me wrong this game was kind of fun at first but as you progress you lose the ability to progress unless you buy up finally the bigger battles especially have lots of issues with bugs and lagging so much so that i had to delete the game entirely honestly done get this game it int worth it
early access review before everyone shouts footnote clone just calm to and read ahead or achieves a fun addictive smooth game play experience whilst it has a footnote art style that is where the line in the sand is drawn it is a battle royal with a difference it has classes unlimited am and a horse which you can cast at any time to traverse across the map give this game a try you wont be disappointed at the time of reviewing only squads was available solo and duo modes need to come out quickly though
fun game been in it since twenty thirteen back during alpha closed beta stages has been a ton of fun since then definitely suggest picking this game up especially as its free to play with that meaning anything bought can be found crafted traded for in game pros randomly generated world personal build areas you can take with you game play at later stage slots of mounts hats blocks fun combat unique classes decent crafting system there is a clan guild system club better quality than rift in multiple biome bosses dungeons for solo or group run hundreds of recipe scrolls to find witch events club events parties mastery rank and player lvi are separate mastery rank up to two hundred currently cons building system can be finney and has a small learning curve lots of grinding for mats easier with a club has some repetitive elements to i overall the game is fantastic and definitely something that can just be picked up for a bit and play get loot and come off again then do it all again the next time with the same feel as i said it can be grind but its not as bad as most other mos so done let that deter you from having a good time the community is a lot of fun and are helpful on the forums in game if you ever have trouble check out the wiki for items and locations or speak up in global chat
this game in sucks it is pay to win if you free to play expect to get rolled on by everyone the programming and algorithm is built to make you as frustrated as possible if you done put money into it facts done kid yourself and think the developers wouldn't do this its obvious done expect fair match making done expect to have fun past the first story mode all it does it make me angry and that int what gaming is about hey if you want to throw hundreds if not thousands of dollars into the game in sure you could compete and maybe have fun probably not this to and you bethesda
quite honestly this is the worst first person shooter live ever played extremely clunky and frustrating mechanics the physics are just ridiculously bad you cant drive a vehicle over a railroad track it just stops you like a brick wall random boulders are hidden at river crossings seemingly purposefully just to get in your way it is so frustrating not fun at all weapons are all extremely unbalanced and often get magical head shots out of nowhere this is rage inducing when it happens to you and when you do it to somebody else its not even fun its just like wow i killed that guy of game is also riddled with bugs one in particular locks you in crouch mode and wont let you do anything all you can do is sit there and get killed and done even get me started on the greedy money grab of in game purchases so stupid whoever recruited the deus at reno must have purposefully gotten all the team and team players they could find they re honestly just not good at their jobs should you play this game absolutely not look elsewhere
real grind game that pretty fun early to mid tier but falls off extremely fast late game due to its unbalanced tiring system that places late world war two vehicles with cold war era vehicles along side with teammates that will consistently spam commands to attack objectives while they themselves are only out to get kills and never attempt to assist you in anyway shape or form
early access review fun game play loop with a great twist on the already tight battle royal formula up like skills and classes good loot system with rarities solid map decent enough net code jacky animations pickup radius is very specific
spent more then one thousands hours in this game but to be honest i cannot recommend it right now started playing it like two years ago and even back then there were some unfavourable factors in it but still i enjoyed it really much because its a free game after all do not agree it is pay to win but the grind have become really annoying over the time its world war two shooter that reminded me of good old battlefield one thousand nine hundred and forty two i think i gave enough time the developers to show me they are trying to improve the game but most of patches did nothing more then adding fancy but useless stuff in game maps are big but people cant find each other and there is no intense action but camping with snipers in bushes and tanks pixel shooting you from other corner of the map para drops and jeep raids are best way of taking flags like in arcade style but one more thing about the grind i played with like three hundred hours with main footmen and till now live reached only level fifteen out of twenty two just imagined i have to play till i retire from work to reach cap and instantly got frustrated still not to present biased opinion here are the good things in game many vehicles weapons and mods for them good and fresh update to of world war two experience some tactical and strategic skills necessity for playing done want to discourage you if you are new to the game give it a try but keep in mind that community is dying and development got stuck and do not expect much from he in the future
early access review it does some things right like taking advantage of its digital nature with card gimmicks like warp which lets you play the card if it was the next card you would draw from the deck it also does some things wrong like no card play history left me frantically hitting the replay button to learn more about the card that was just played yes there is an instant replay system although it was often too fast for me to read the cards even in slow mode and some cards done go to the graveyard where you can read their effects the tutorial holds your hand a bunch often forcing you into bad moves to teach a point until about the last two color which makes it easily shippable since the game already shows hints throughout it also blocks the screen a bunch with info telling you more about the card effects each time you draw a card with a new effect which makes it even easier to miss what the opponent is playing after the tutorial i started with the gauntlet mode since it was my first quest and it was always somewhere between beating the artificial intelligence to negative he or getting mana drought even with the very nice mana mulligan system in place to lessen it yes even in the remade beginner decks i forgot to mention that the last round of gauntlet always has a gimmick like the top card of your deck is played instantly which often results in gimmicks that favor the artificial intelligence and that the next time you play gauntlet its a harder difficulty which does not benefit players who simply want a quick way to try out various decks with artificial intelligence or earn quick gold the worst part is that the artificial intelligence will often continue playing cards to strengthen its army dragging the match on further even when it has a flying creature you cant block that does lethal damage to you while it usually makes smart moves it often plays very slow which can be annoying when you re losing this is something i expect from either a player who doesn't realize they won or one who likes to torment their enemies not something a bot should do as for draft and casual games in my experience the queue times are only about a minute or less although if you jump right into casual you re going to be playing prebuilt starter decks is customized player decks unless you buy some packs with in game currency the reward system for both gauntlet and draft is good you get a few loses before it makes you start over but you always get rewards usually gold at first then gold and cards then gold and card and free booster packs you also get free random boosters each time you level up one of the individual color i mean random as opposed to specifically giving you more cards of that color puzzle mode or as its otherwise known win this turn or die to a fire spell int very rewarding as it gives you very little gold and very little practical application since its a dumb solution to a hypothetical situation that would never happen in a game like you having four power and four types of influence but your opponent having twelve power two types of influence old is used to buy packs about one thousands a pack and five thousands gold you earn at about twenty five gold per match if you re a bad player in gauntlet five hundred if you play against players who often have better cards than you is required to buy enough for a draft which you keep the cards from crystals are for more exclusive stuff usually cosmetic stuff when its only purchasable with crystals there a third currency called shift stones and you get them for beating various objectives and can earn more by turning in duplicates of cards you done use but i still for the life of me cant figure out their purpose i now figured out you have to right click on cards in collection to craft new ones you can also destroy cards you hate for more shift stones even though i did some find enjoyment playing it i was often bored and or frustrated with very long games that rewarded me very little even if i did manage to come out on top i cant personally recommend this game because if i had a dollar for each time i conceded a game in casual id have enough money to buy a better game than this although its still better than mtg arena
early access review update tried rob craft out again for a few hours to see where progress has been made or lost as predicted most changes are made due to the dwindling player base this explains why in the past they removed barriers to matchmaking like tier divisions level affected matching reducing the amount of players per team it center i joined now to find that they've further made changes that exacerbate imbalanced matches by removing level requirement to unlock cup giving everyone the same cup allotment at maximum and allowing bots of any cup mixture to play together it simply totals up the cup on a team and makes it match up on the other team the problem with this is it inevitably ends up where you'll have one team with cup evenly spread among them ranging from a to the maximum and the other team will be full of scouts with a single person at maximum cup the game still suffers mob mentality wipe outs and favor it to be played as so as much as there are cries of tactics are valid nothing still beats team rushing sadly though these changes have done nothing to help new players against old hats like myself and even older hats who understand to forcing and damage mitigation which is near gone most resorting to either sheer bricks upon bricks or mobility evasion read drones only played a dozen matches today lost one and that because i decided to use a stupid bot you expect a noon to one mega leg rocket launcher shield gen that it and even then it was a close loss the ultimate kick to the teeth though is the changes to the battle arena mode specifically the imbalance detected system where it will cause plutonium to spawn on the map if the enemy destroy it they instantly equal the progress the winning team has made all this serves to do is infuriate the winning team and delay the match even further as the losing team may have now equalised but is still on a losing footing control point wise if the losing team choose to ignore the plutonium and focus on the control points again they re still on a losing footing as it stands rob craft has an average weekly player base of three thousand spiking six thousand in twenty fourteen it was fourteen thousand spiking twenty five thousand lets see how you fare in twenty eighteen free am if you re even still around update free am are now trying to censor negative reviews as abusive even if they are not tips twitter give up with rob craft old rob craft deus done know what they want their game to be they've tried datum sports creative building mob player choice progression forced progression bland progression each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying any work players have put in to creating their bots they establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of balancing or enabling player creativity and doing the complete opposite not to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes for example my being broken turning it into who has the most medics wins and hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification because not all bots were classified correctly translation one in maybe one hundred were wrong and its harvard edit to include the latest update max load out again free am done understand normal development practices they threw in massive changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke flak is bugged dog nan is bugged a bomb super speed heal mugs are bugged free aim firing without los matchmaking is atrocious still blink and dam are stupidly expensive both pc and cup they should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink instead of this too many wild changes one step forward two steps back is this developers motto rob craft initially had a sensible mixture of creativity and function there was also a sensible mix of grind progression and sense of achievement it was a little lacklustre in places for example the role play system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how effective those unlocks were as you progressed in level and cup your bots got bigger your weapons better this has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order over time with no player input once you unlock an item that is it there no improvement everything is by default tier ten this in turn made building robots boring no more balancing weaponry is arm or is mobility if you chose to go cosmetic bot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in theme now sure you can build a bot exactly as you want as long as you like yellow pink white grey brown as your color palette the other colours are locked to premium note they touted this flattening of tiers as an improvement to creative robot building then there the slew of problems with actual game play mechanics initially there were balancing issues as expected they kind of balanced themselves out up until unleashed legendary update and the deus got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except sags this last update saw them add the near useless flak severely nerf the medics nan and turned it into so craft again they also did away with many of the useful game play information elements spotting now just says enemy spotted with no indication of flier hover walker they claimed this is because bots were complicated to classify yet for the most they were classified correctly this means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets this also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is rail heavy and needs more sub machine gun or plasma the game has also suffered match making issues from day one resulting in differing me as the latest of which is the team who has the most medics wins the hiding of bot type and spotting call outs i think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was six rails and two plasmas is say six sags and two medics put simple the deus have taken this game in far too many directions too rapidly and with no forethought initially it was a datum game then they opened it up to the creative block builders then expanded to boss battles removed was one megabit is lots of little bots quite fun then switching to try their hand at mob like tower matches then trying to create some kind of bespoke robot market where players can sell their bots but their currency system is too expensive to support its like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half asking it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players this is likely the reason why they flattened their game down to basic progression may
early access review do you like space flight simulators do you like mobs do you like playing support do you like playing tank do you like playing a cruiser well fractured space has it all seriously though if you like mobs but want to change the game style a bit you have to play this i mean me myself i stopped playing for a while yesterday i launched it by mistake played one game another and another and another and another and another and it was one am this game will make me have to put an auto shutdown on my computer again
tries to copy bigger games of the genre like he or day at least its free i done recommend it tough graphics are horrible and sounds done even work properly you can get yourself some ammo and guns right when you spawn if you are lucky enough sadly the map is too big and it will take a while to move from point a to point a most of the locations are kinda the same so done even bother going away from the middle of the map where all the action is
early access review really wanted to like this game being a huge fan of tags but the resource system is the worst live ever encountered i promptly lost nine out of my first twelve games due to not drawing enough resources which immediately turned me off from the game the absolute worst thing you can experience in a card game is not even being able to compete and dying without playing a single card this game needs to fix its horrendous mulligan resource system before anyone should even think about investing time money into it
is fun at first but the poorly made physics engine and crappy graphics honestly ruin it it is very much a pay town game as many steam games are but this is too extreme any player that hast spent more than fifty is practically instantly destroyed and is almost impossible to go up in without spending some cash would not recommend sorry
controlling sucks hard to get around as a newbie expensive unlike another game here that is free to play but awesome this doesn't give you anything free graphics suck did i mention controlling sucks no just noon
since the update fifty one only teams including players i would call them bots as they act like that laugh out loud that play like a monkeys it a so annoying losing like battles in row it makes a bored so much this game is until a are losing battles and missing shots then it gets great and i really enjoyed it but it wants your valley to be empty how unexpected for we and free game edit in to a game for impatient people and those who have problems with anger recommending this game depends on mood after a few battles
early access review direction end game like the japanese no arena battleground ranking all dungeons you can solo servers constantly either down or full waiting three hours on que not worth early access maybe free to play but even than its going to be a cash crab grab game do not waste your time refund as soon as possible if you bought early access
early access review this game is good to play once but the sounds are extremely wacky and while the pot clanging is annoying it is even harder to judge the distance of gunfire also while the environment is pretty its not exactly fun to play in
woo boy this is gonna be a fun review old at the end this is a good game it really is there so much i want to say about it so ill get started graphically this game is amazing not because its hype realistic but because the art style is unique to a point where its almost impossible for it to look aged this game is ten years old and still looks great game playlist its fun you run around you shoot people on the opposite team its not always shooting bullets though there are nine classes each with their own unique weapons there are rocket launchers grenade launchers and flamethrowers there are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use the different classes are played in a variety of different ways so there probably a favourite class for everyone and then there character design i could probably gush about this for hours but i wont each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette they are all very unique to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme the scouts main weapons are all scatter guns the heavy main weapons are all mini guns it center these characters not only have unique designs but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities its so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free the characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable there is probably something to be said about diversity here especially because of its competitor over watch there no dancing around it this game is simply not as diverse in character gender and ethnicity as over watch is however the characters presented in this game have far more personality than the characters presented in over watch i have played over watch before and unlike this game was not enthralled by the characters with this game i was almost immediately drawn in because of the characters themselves not just the game play sadly however women designs were once upon a time made for this game but for whatever reason were scrapped they were very unique designs too and if the team actually had followed through on making them and had applied the same effort they did for their male characters they would have made some of the best dang female characters in gaming in gonna apologize about the over watch comparison but in still salty about blizzard making half baked female characters and then being touted as progressive when they re really just playing the middle to attract the most players the team fortress two character designers could make women characters that would crush over watch in every way if they ever decided to do that there is also something to be said about the community it sucks big time if you re a woman or have a high pitched voice you re probably better off not using the voice chat at least in casual mode if you do you'll probably get sexist comments hurled at you or if they just think you've got a high pitched voice called a squeaker and might even get kicked a lot of people in casual mode also type a bunch of racist sexist homophobic and every is and phobic thing in the book into the chat its painful to read but hey it sure is fun getting dominations on homophobes and then taunting after killing them so that something you can do of course it int all bad and most games of this nature end up with a community like that anyway so its no surprise really there are a bunch of good folks out there too live met some good folks through this game and if you play it for long enough you will too just done be surprised about the bad folks plus there a bunch of different sub communities that are usually full of nice people old its a good game and its free to pick up and play so you've got nothing to lose but your time its fun has a bad overall community but nice little sub communities unique and fun characters and a lot of cool maps play it and have fun
access review the game is good and bug free and i would really recommend it but the reason i am not is the privacy policy my god they collect everything web searches personal computer stats what antivirus you use plugins of your web browser and what not it is really scary
early access review best free battle royal game maybe footnote is still better made but of very nice weapons i just want more optimized first person shooter new map and there is no option to change resolution in game
early access review much like everyone else here has said this really is like mtg mixed with a bit of hearthstone basically hearthstone visual style and ability to add elements and a few other ideas like weapons mixed with most of the best mtg mechanics the tutorial impressed me enough for me to want to drop money on it which says a lot i think especially since live played dozens of these games
including sushi us twenty seven flankers lock on modern aircraft and flying cliffs early a digital combat simulator represents a twenty years of development which slowly begins to show the basic systems of a flight sim are in place and this project is on the brink of entering early access while for the first fifteen years it used to run like as soon as there was some scenery on the screen like big cities this has now also reached a point where you can play it with most details on a mid range computer may i recommend to get the free version and give it the time it deserves you get two planes with their systems modelled which is more content than most full price games and it will cost you absolute nothing because it represents the content of digital combat simulator ten years ago if you have made up your mind you want to see the real deal you could invest another fifty to three hundred to get the best flight simulator on the market that up to you you know by now that there will be several summers so here we go this is not for little children who thrown themselves on the floor when something does not go their way as of now you will need to run two different versions of the game actually three if you also want to run steam an alpha and a beta and although a unified version has been announced for early twenty sixteen we now almost have twenty eighteen and we still have no firm release date this is the sim that created the original soon a lot of parts are missing and unlikely to come out before two thousand and thirty it still misses a campaign there are some linear campaigns but they are or any dynamic elements you will also most likely just fly around the planes and never do actual combat with them because that takes years to learn now you can just and wait for a better home flight sim to come around on a market that has already been dead since a two thousand and five or spend the next months learning hundreds of switches in fully clickable cockpits take off and feel like you are in a real air lane no other flight sim comes anywhere near that
enjoyable at first its action based game play is quite fun but the whole game gets really repetitive much like all the cryptic games it is a free to play in its traditional way you can play for free but all the cool stuff are not free same as all the consumables used to reset your ability points it center
early access review to describe it with the words of one of my friend list players looks like wing commander twenty fifteen its not exactly like this but it has the same flair its fun to play try it
i have been playing freestyle since two thousand and seven of course back then it was the original freestyle street basketball by sierra online now we have the second instalment of this series and it is great there is no other game in the market that allows you to play team basketball with your friends like this one does i think it has room for improvement but what doesn't i really hope now being on steam it will allow them to do greater things with this game i totally recommend this to basketball fans specially if you plan to play with friends
this is pure simulator with almost none of virtual help its all up to you and your driving style i love that in simulators when they just put you in action and leave you to learn about the game through the game play when i started playing i thought this game is all about paying for extra stuff yea it is expensive as hell but its a good game sure only one fictional track for use is terrible the sound is awesome and so are the physics first feel game play controller support physics nine hundred and ten driving one thousand and ten crashing physics one thousand and ten crash damage three hundred and ten sound price overall game experience nine hundred and ten very fun but very expensive and a lot of locked stuff ruins the fun game play especially if you have to pay for every car and track edit most of the competitions lend you everything necessary for racing so you can explore new cars and tracks that feature is very good
with the addition of the scourge warlock recently i decided to give this game another try and to boy do i enjoy it let me just say this i hit level thirty i can now hunt dragons yes
definitely not free to play id rather spend the money on buying a roll royce and ram it against a wall until it looks like a frigging smart the amount of money you need to spend to earn the privilege of not having doc telling you you cant shoot is absurd buy weapons buy bullets buy callers this int a game id recommend for anyone
early access review looked like smash so i downloaded it played i got my friends to play it they love it get a friend for then the adventure of intense battles and laughs start download it and have fun
cannot get enough of this cross of so many games its actually original live spent so much time designing my house its no longer a game its a dream that must happen and nothing like the others deus are amazing and obviously work day and night to make this a true masterpiece
early access review the superior first person shooter experience one thousand one hundred and ten ign no hackers in any match ever absolutely no broken animations hit boxes or other completely game breaking bugs or glitches at all i have never in any match played against anyone called xxx layer at level fourteen million four hundred and fifty four thousand one hundred and twenty three who definitely did to have wall hacks aim bot unlimited money and was flying around the map like a this is call of duty world at india absolutely would recommend to anyone with anger management issues suicidal depression or of a nervous disposition like bin for the deus
when you get shot down strafing the enemy but its of because your out of control plane wreck slams into the a a and blows it up and you salute the explosion while parachuting down tips wow youtube co watch fri puma
early access review besides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something or you could just spend real money to buy it because its that kinda game i would have to say this game sucks from the realistic game play the completely balanced factions or maybe the real time wars that players influence i would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says lets start with the free to play part it as stated above can take up to weeks just to get enough money and experience points to buy a weapon however if you think that you re above this and done want to wait you can just spend the ten us dollars to buy it right there and then buying it with credits even allows you to completely skip over the experience points requirements along with the money then comes the realistic and simulation battles if one could call them that i believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model which although had some nice hopes is for lack of better words she many a times i have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas when i get into a firefight with another soldier mid shooting my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle int in position because apparently my gun was running into some invisible force for firing then there the maps of how i hate all of the maps from large open areas with almost no cover from base to base to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog all in all the maps a rent that great either simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game after that there goes the balance which just as everything before is little but existent id like to paint a little picture for you here american bombing planes two bomb german bombing planes one bomb soviet bombing planes four bombs kinda crazy right but the german plane must have some redeeming qualities right like better mobility or stronger bullets nope its the exact same as the other if not worse after the planes comes the tanks and weapons id like to just say real quick germany is easily the most underpowered and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better or rebuff the other factions as they just recently added the soviets into the game which look to have the best weapons from the poor guns of the german to the crazy one shot rifles and luda is fire rate and accuracy of the american weapons to the overly good starting soviet guns its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction well over others tank vehicles while pretty well balanced are very overpriced and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction all in all the games balance seems to be lacking and its actually rather annoying to see the deus favor some factions over others those real time wars you were expecting or that huge scale battles that you thought you were going to get wrong again while yes there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on and are ranked most battles are only sixteen a sixteen this looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the class variety that the game has leading to searching for game up to ten minutes and that without a squad being in a squad can take ages finally after getting into a game you may notice that the whole server consist of just that class or very few other you can see that this leads to frustrating game play and overly long searching time for a game that it may plop you in which ends roughly a minute after your joining also in not really going to approach the whole campaign thing as its seems to literally be pointless wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction but you can almost always bet the germans lose even when they win all in all this game really in a train wreck that yes i have had some fun playing needs a lot and i cant stress enough how much i mean that of work also before you say of well you've spent almost one hundred hours playing the game it must be good i would like to state that i have only spent that much time in game because i wanted to be able to experience a large portion of it so that i may give a proper rating and suggestions May
valve ignores their community entirely of heavy is underpowered his bullet travels three feet and then becomes useless lets nerf him again the phlox is causing a problem lets buff it into the heavens wow those are some nice custom weapon skins done mind the amount of work the user did on it lets ignore it all should we test the update before we launch it nah that all fix itself the prices on the of market are too high who cares if it gives us money were happy people are outrageous about the matchmaking saying that one team is filled with free to play gib uses and the other team is with ups with thousands of hours should we add some kind of balancing rank system sarah unbalance is fun hey lets put the weakest character in the game heavy against one of the high tier ones pro and see who people like better that way we can nerf heavy even more and make pro even stronger its balanced right people are saying that the vac system sucks since it takes three weeks two months for a single hacker to get banned and sometimes it doesn't even work should we add a new system nah the hacker get banned eventually so it doesn't matter the community is demanding more weapons from us lets add pointless redskins instead you need to stop right now look at you sitting in front of your computers with cheetos and money all over your shirt valve you re dirt to me stopping the development of games and doing nothing about counter strike go was painful to me but ruining this game was the last straw its time to stop
this is first and foremost a mobile game ported to steam is that a bad thing maybe the thing is that how much you spend is up to you but if you want to get your favourite individual cards you better hope they are rare or normal and not put in the arbitrary pack rewards while the game gives free currency to get packs frequently it only happens with events that give it away in big lumps else you re getting trickles of gems second the game plays like press era yugo with a smaller field to make games faster this is both a strength and weakness for the game as while this brings in vets of the game it can turn away more meta player players who favourite car archetype is not in the game third this game is very competitive at times and try to subtlety nudge you into paying with the vagabond dullest who are just ghosts of high ranked player versus player players who also duel with sometimes bullshit modifiers like having a full field or having only two cards in your hand add those modifiers with a good deck and the odds are so stacked against you at times its like an whale versus a mouse sure you can harp on me saying i only have one hundred hours on the game but its a game that discourages playing for long without paying and while i done mind having cards from post a if you re gonna port an archetype port an archetype that fits within classic era not archetypes that have good syndrome pendulum monsters

early access review got in the game played one hour requested refund graphics are bad saggy as crap combat is wonky took me ten minutes to get through the first quest of the tutorial because the translations are so bad not to mention it was so over hyped and such a let down that my fault though
early access review hey guys the game is great its a grind but who said it was gonna be easy i give it a add me on steam i have a community soul dedicated to aqua three dimensional and were building up purpose is for grind part is and guides tips and tricks and will eventually be converted into a guild add me if interested i am very active thanks
what can i say this game is amazing if you like realistic mil sim games this is for you recently i got an oculus rift which completely elevated the experience i recommend this game with and without virtual reality in every way
a totally addictive substitute for a certain other block based sandbox adventure the name of which eludes me at present you start in a random location in a randomly selected world from a short list of handcrafted candidates that world is composed of things all of which are made of blocks of equal size there are some exceptions such as creatures and some objects all of which are unique quirky and enjoyable it is very easy to find yourself overpowered in this game and so far the only way that the deus have slowed down ones journey to overpowered ness is by making you work through items tier by tier as opposed to just making the best stuff as soon as you find the best materials i think the only times i have negative emotions about this game are when in mentally expecting something from that other game dammit its name is on the tip of my tongue but those moments are fewer and further between they re also sufficiently different that one can easily enjoy both without either feeling redundant so live reached the end of this review and still cant remember the name of the other game like this one just like that game however this one is essentially characterised by mining and or crafting
early access review sadly i feel like the most recent update is the death knell for the game what was once a promising and ridiculously fun game has been rendered into nothing more than a pay to win slog that has lost all sense of what made once made it great
early access review look at of house played to understand i am not just on a new game high this game is a great collectible card game that is very accessible to a new player and still relatively new so its not so deep and developed that a new player wont know whats going on but balance changes and new cards are added to keep everything fresh as well as monthly ladders with rewards for finishes do yourself a favor and just download it if you re looking for a collectible card game to try to get into and love to brew of do tournaments or draft or it center its one thousand and ten
this game is not worth a penny to put into this game is full of hackers and cheaters and is not any sort of fun at all if you want a real game that is far better then this and that is fun play area three area has way better graphics bigger maps more people can play and a lot more of and us you can actually get out of the tank as well on area but can you do that here nope so area three plus world of tanks minus please done make the mistake of getting this and spending all all of your money for a horrible game
the game is very fun and all there i sent much grind but there is two things i done like the optimization and how easy you can get the best gear i am constantly getting two thousand and forty first person shooter in the game even tho i have a as us a two hundred and eighty series gnu eight go ram and phenom ii a nine hundred and fifty five processor four cups ghz if i really tried i could get lucite in about twenty four hours if you a rent into being creative in this game then the fun is gonna end pretty fast
done play this its a pay to win disguised as an free to play live played for four years check real eye if you done think in telling the truth nether rum is my characters name i played in the web browser i probably will continue to play because this game is addicting however its stupid and broken now kab am has done nothing for the game and in fact has ruined it hackers spammers and cash grabs make this game pretty much a fun to look at
early access review so i wanted to see what going on with all the commotion with this game after i left it around six months ago i think but it was a long time jumped into a game and was confused with everything the lasers fired so slowly better of with a shotgun really which defeats the point of and sub machine gun there would be lots of other stuff i would go into detail but i done want to waste my time with a game i would play everyday but now ruined thanks to free am if they changed the game to what is was before they added aero flags then i would go back to the game because that where it went all down hill
the game is very hardcore its short description is everything can one shot you wanna play hardcore another longer description would be do you want to waste thirty minutes trying to buy a ring from other players welcome to the world of ask done disturb mode fake offer retarded trader ignore trading system pros wide variety of builds any class can use any skill a huge passive skill tree reminds some kind of a star atlas many layers of improving your character skill gems passive skills god powers ascendancy rewards enchantments lots of skills customisation skills can be respect for a price of in game currency keeps being updated with new content awesome gloom style graphics not cartoony like diabolo three interesting endgame content interesting currency system this game has no gold as other similar games completely free the only no cosmetic thing you can buy is more tabs in your loot stash cons extremely awful optimisation you personal computer from twenty fourteen runs battlefield thirty four on ultra you will have eight first person shooter in a multiplayer map here poor not interesting main storyline especially in comparison with diabolo three most awful trade system ever based on adequacy of human beings which is absurd makes you a currency addict people farm currency to buy items instead of trying to get those items themselves one shot mechanics many things can one shot you regardless of your defense
this game int that bad you done have to pay to win to actually get things in this game like everyone says i have two sets of costume arm or from a halloween it center and it was all free you guys just haven played long enough to get the things that they offer i have about seven level fifty players a level seventy and others all without paying a single cent player versus player is still a bit overpowered and annoying highest rank was ranks live played this game for about two years and in fine without paying anything do the events they give and you'll actually get things
this game is fun when cdr i loved this game and it kicked me in the teeth this game is fun when you re fighting the enemy and not the game this game is fun when the game int punishing you for every step you take forwards constantly taunting you that you re just a little bit further away from that tank you want that aircraft you crave the game is fun when your vehicle int damaged and you have no way to repair it or on fire or being blown up in your spawn the game is fun when you get to play with your friends in the vehicles you want to play but still with realistic vehicle characteristics except you cant because realistic doesn't allow germany to play with most other nations for no reason this game is fun when you re not losing money each time you spawn a vehicle this game is fun when the developers a rent bashing your knees with the keyboard and trying to steal your wallet would i recommend this game to have fun sure as long as you re happy with the above
i came into trove expecting a game that would peak my interest for a day or two so i could take a small break from wow i have since cancelled my membership to wow and am playing trove daily this game is like min craft mixed in with the grind of vanilla wow if you done like grind games do not play this game there are levels and misery levels in this game with almost forty hours i have a level twenty character and my master level is thirty this game is a grind est but insanely fun a month animal if you want to join a club guild
worth a look if you like fallout as it has that of charm but far too shallow and repetitive to grab your attention for longer than a few hours very disappointing as it has the potential to be a great game if there was just more to do once you've grown your vault to a decent size and unlocked all the rooms bummer three hundred and ten
early access review this is quite possible the best free to play the best collectible card game and is one of the best card games i have ever played diverse meta great rewards for playing over all one of my favourite games i currently have going great game when watching to or just focusing on it
there are few people who have never heard of the ancient scrolls the elder scrolls every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans arena and dagger fol for those who are older morrow ind and oblivion for those younger and finally sky rim for the youngest all these games can be called cult each introduced something of its own into the world of elder scrolls what we brought the game the elder scrolls online tam riel unlimited lets try to figure it out firstly i do not agree that this game falls out of the general series trampling on the canons of scrolls yes the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive he is not elected as was before not nerva in and not do akin but only one of thousands out of millions this seems to hurt secondly what do we have all the same nairn torn by the war and on the brink of death events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series probably this fact also embarrasses many well in the third the changed game model which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case i can not say that innovations have pleased me but i have to put up with this
in short path of exile is a must try play game if you enjoy arg games path of exile started in twenty thirteen and is still growing path of exile brings arg that gives massive ways of building your character and the design is quite notice type story now when it comes to story for me itself the story was he not saying that story is bad but will say that it didst real drag me in that much too feel amazed not to mention that i didst real dig that much through dialog from character graphics the game as i said looks gothic style too me but even thought it looks like that what makes me a bit annoyed is how your character feels like when it comes to design no matter how much you try you will still look almost like a hobo if you done start buying some cosmetics or earn them through events replay poe did great when it comes to game play and how its ability works there so much when it comes to making your build its so fun example you found a fireball and now you want it to be even more good of just slap multi shot and slap more stuff and combine gems and all that and you get some epic cluster ability that is so satisfying that your personal computer freezes than we got a massive skill tree real massive i int kidding what i done enjoy about path of exile doe is that your own build if you are not experienced with the game will seventy five suck the close you are to the end the more and more you see your build failing now its not always gonna be like that but still the game allows you to build anything but if you wanna reach to the end you will probably have to stick too few common things even though you done want to
would be easy enough to recommend for casual action role playing game fans if it want full of the usual massively multiplayer online malarkey of getting you to fork over money for every little thing so new stay away done bother game is cute but the game play is tried and true would be the most cheri sable way to describe but really it gets boring pretty fast
early access review so this game is a good horror game that relies mostly on the its going to get you scares and pop ups you'll find notes scattered about that develop a story and pull you into the game to give you a reason to keep going the rooms also do a good job at being interesting and giving environmental clues i wont say much else as experiencing it first hand is really the only way to even understand what others might be saying i wound up dying in a fashion that i didst understand in room three hundred and twelve due to an encounter but ill definitely pick it up again to see it through to the end worth the free price one thousand and ten would unwrap a disappointing present again
early access reviewing bad suck my your in dumb ass bad in game autistic only play this boring bad game you getting cancer playing this in bad game suck my in add learn to make game idiots
pretty much the only hunting game that takes a star at not being a fast passed arcade shooter been playing for years and i keep go in back the range of hunting areas species and hunting techniques mean you can keep the relativity at bay new content is fairly regular but the game overall is expensive a membership is about twenty that not bad but a new rifle will cost you five and their is so much stuff to buy and this game is not free to play you can play but its more of an on going demo you will get one basic gun and one basic shotgun and two species on a rotation its access to the tip of the iceberg to see if its for you
i done recommend this because after a while that shut you down for nothing and then you will get a error saying sever call timed out what means sorry your a loser and we shouted down your game so i done want people getting this game otherwise if it was a update i will delete this and recommend it but for now i done
this game used to be amazing i loved it i winged it due to the fact that you could drop in and out on a fly play with your friends and valve public servers were easy to get in to the queue times now take forever casual servers are irritating to play on this modernization that the developers are implementing is cutting the head off of the hydra eventually it will run out of heads and this game will crash and burn before i loved it it was my favourite game but now i done want to touch this game with a ten foot pole rip team fortress two
early access review note i have only played two games so far this is exactly what it says a spaceship battle game it is well done considering the point at development it is in there is a bit of a problem with just picking up the game and playing as it does not explain how the game works and what the goal of the game is very well but once you figure it out it is fine the people i played with were friendly and helpful so if you ever do not understand something just ask and they should help i look forward to further development of this game
war thunder is by far the leader in flight simulators out there despite being free to play war thunder has perfected graphical detail with painstakingly modelled aircraft and now tanks to create the ultimate world war two aerial and ground battle experience the user interface is intuitive allowing for the use of just mouse and keys to control an aircraft or tank however the option of a joystick is there for more experienced players as well as the focus on multiplayer battles gain in have also credited the game with a series of single player missions that help earn credits in game whilst the war thunder economy has seen rapid change over the last fifty six patches it has finally been levelled out to create a gradual but still progressive and entertaining progression system that allows for a long but rewarding levelling system one area that lacks the polish that is seen in other areas of the game is the cooperative multiplayer as this aspect of the game sees a confusing fri ending and squad system that not only is clunky to use but also reduces frame rate substantially and this is a game killer for players that use less powerful pcs or laptops conclusively war thunder presents itself as a highly successful game with superb graphics game play rewards and a growing player base as well as the addition of constantly updated features do to its open beta status i highly recommend this game nine hundred and ten
early access review getting anywhere is hard but that probably because you need to pay for the games cant really recommend it on its own but its like my and you could probably have some fun with a few friends for a while in not going to say i done recommend this game because i mostly played this game at am with a friend and i think i had a good time
note to see this review in its true form go to help help inside two is massive multiplayer free roam and free two play the game play of planet side two varies sometimes the map will be filled with small skirmishes over key areas other times massive armies will attack for a large command post now because planet side two is a free to play game you might be wondering if the paying players get an advantage the answer would yes and no yes because paying players can get gunnar or and upgrades faster no because they done get any paid only weapons for example they cant drop two thousand and thirty and get some massively overpowered gun that is only for them players in planet side two can choose from six classes light assault heavy assault combat medicine engineer and mech suit planet side two is meant to be a tactics game and live had the most fun while storming massive strongholds with an organised unit in planet side two instead of clans you have outfits now you can join a platoon without being in that outfit but joining one lets you quickly find them when they are online visualise planet side two is great textures are high res shadows are soft and lighting is done just right the best part is that it doesn't take too much gnu or cup power the not so great part is that it only runs in bit mode game play takes part on three massive open world continents on the world aura is the three continents you fight on are indore amir and america each map has its own theme one is icy and cold another is warm and wet and the last is a dry arid wasteland the servers are normally la free live played at least fifteen hours and i can only remember lagging out four times and that was when i was in a two hundred person battle one bad note is that newcomers will have a hard time fighting all of other levelled up players but this just means the boobs should team up with the veterans and provide support like a playing as a sniper medic or engineer another bad thing is something that is the fault of the player base and that is that most players done want to team up and listen to orders they just want to run around like in call of duty shooting people in little killing sprees that not how this game works and if you try to play it like call of duty all you will do is end up killing yourself and hampering your teams attempt to win the only thing i can really say i wished the game had was a story line maybe a coop campaign it just seems to be such a waste to never use all of the epic background the deus put into the factions and areas i guess that asking too much for a massively multiplayer online anyways check planet side two out its free its fun and its on steam
war thunder is sadly one of the game i decided to quit after following it over a long time playing a few hundred hours non team and two hundred and fort three hours on steam i can safely say that i am done with it live been a beta tester for planes tanks and have had experience with early game play and the final game play very often not a big difference between those two the flight part is very good might be even one of the best free flight games on the market you have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways bomber dive bomber torpedo bomber fighters attackers jets the matchmaking is okay depending on the game mode you are playing you have the choice between arcade realistic simulation the names indicate how realistic each mode is a huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels the sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane i would still recommend this for casual players the tank part is incredibly bad many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta but were never resolved the deus were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixed while they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during world war two hey doesn't matter lets fully load them with it now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable overall i do not recommend this game the grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic
this is the best game ever hello i am sander i am gone review this game for you also you can add me on smite my name is dutch of eur only the game play is amazing it feels like you are a real got the update the game in a good way not like league of legends that its only good for competitive no this game is also fun as causal i really enjoy this game i buyer the ultimate god pack so i get every old and new god that they are gone make if you gone play this game buy it you will love it also the voice packs are amazing what i done like are the old skins the new skins are a lot better then the old ones some times you play with players that quit league of legends so the flame you if you are bad but the most players are really friendly pros many gods to choose any game modes competitive as casual good community the listen to the community god level classes portions no jesus rating nine hundred and ten
lots of replay ability no pay to win mechanics great skins a slew of diverse characters to choose from and an entertaining sports scene this game offers quite a bit considering its free
early access review hire corrected everything they did wrong the class system feels better than ever now and the game play is super enjoyable the people complaining in these reviews just haven gotten on the game recently guys obviously an alpha game is going to keep changing until they reach a good state and i believe they reached that state people need to realize this and come back into the game they once loved
early access review one of the best online tags ever plus its so generous compared to the others easy to craft cards as well so long as you know what you are doing missed event promos craft them
tribute summon lvi five monster and attack opponent uses enemy controller and takes my card is about to wipe out my life point they disconnect still lose the duel would duel again
early access review can see why everyone is talking about how this is the next min craft it certainly feels and looks like it i mean that in a very positive way if played right this could easily be the next thing in just worried about the ability to mod it seeing as it mainly seems to be online min craft vanilla has a lot to play with but what really made the game what it is is the mods so i really hope to see large amounts of modding happening with this game in the future as it is if you like min craft even just a bit good chance you'll like this plus its free hard to argue with at least trying it
pay for better loot its fun but premium on this crap game common no scope weapons on far shoots its like slingshot with stones hours to join official stupid idea by someone made if your char die you have ten minute to wait or make another one but its so stupid

game to a full release out of beta on june twenty twenty elevens to help fund the games development optional micro transactions were added to the game drawing a mixed response from players the

helping us to grow the game over time the game has been june
its beyond amazing and i am a real world professional driver endless options they are always improving the simulation to make it as real as it gets i personally want to see more real world tracks like the world famous dayton rolex twenty four or road coarse and the next insurance track on the list the world famous searing also known for its gruelling twelve or endurance races road america was just released and its also one of my personal favourites i have hundreds if not thousands of laps at all of these three tracks combined and the technical skills each track demands from teams and drivers alike are some of the most epic feats of human and machine strength found in only a few places anywhere in the world so if you want the thrill of speed excitement and the feeling of being a real driver like me i highly recommend this driving simulation it will also help you become a better real world driver if that what your also looking for but remember racing belongs in the designated places where safety and control measures have been specifically designated to save lives street racing is not cool but road coarse racing is drive safe on the public streets and highways but go for broke and find the outer edge of your envelope on the race track sincerely neil nine hundred and eighteen smith
this game is super fun first i did not liked it because i lost my account but i got it back and right now i love all the dragons that are in the game hope they add more titans dragons three
so this game is awesome live been playing this more than any of my games its like min craft but for me is way looking than min craft i so far done dislike anything but things will be fixed since i have been experiencing i like that you can glide use teleworkers explore a big map have or play with many many people and can be for selected people you want to play with i really like the idea that you can claim your own land from first claim i made it but the thing is you can keep going with claims and before reaching out to less than ten claim somewhere there you have to pay coins a currency in game but its worth it because you really done need two hundred claims to build things i like the fact you can build underground and not sure how long can you keep going and same with sky how long can you reach i like the fact that you can build with your friends got ten claims your friends got ten claims well now you could say you both have twenty claims if so i like that i can build two claims building and have someone do the other half in two claims i believe there so much to this game i really like the blocks items it center i like the biome and really like the creatures
game is not optimized in the least even for the platform it is designed on at the same time as a guest you are limited to one gun one target one hunting area any unlocks or purchases are for temporary use only no kind of experience points item unlocking system whether bought with the impossible learn in game currency or real money on top of that online connections are miserable even to hoping servers and hosts would recommend for mild amusement for a couple hours but certainly not any kind of real investment in either time or money
early access review ill buy the game at the regular price a lot of the negative reviews are from butt hurts who are salty typical massively multiplayer online launch this game int a genre changing event though the combat is niche and hopefully they figure out the action combat system as soon as possible
this is probably one of the best and most unique team based shooters out there i cant even begin to explain it its simple yet complex at the same time even with nine different classes at first you may have no clue what the hell is even happening but after a little bit of playing once you learn this game you can never forget the combination between all the unique and fun weapons and all the other aspects such as having a conga dance with the other team and much much more you can play the game how ever you want and even after ten years this game still has a big community and is still getting updates even to this day even if this game sometimes makes me mad i will always love team fortress two May
this game sucks there is too much salty people the community is and you done need skill once you have all the gear that they put into this game this game is garbage i said it a million times and i wont hesitate to say it again it sucks the dungeons and first games are great giving you a purpose of how good the game feels then you meet the community and player versus player system once again this game sucks if you rage easily do not play this game that is all
room is a rogue like game that is heavily reliant on a stable internet connection and server connection in order to play the game unfortunately room very frequently has problems with server side lag unless you are comfortable with the fact that server side lag will often kill your character making hours and hours of game play almost completely pointless done even bother playing
one of the most free play mobs you'll find unlike other mobs in this one you can unlock skins and earn premium currency also known as gems simply by playing the game its wonderfully addictive if you re new or considering to play the game you can earn extra rewards by referring somebody if you re struggling to refer somebody you can always refer buddha no
this is a game with a lot of selection for ships ranging from logistics to full on combat to campy sniper so much to play with and with the crew and ship customisation its good fun
first things first yes the game is free to play however at the free to play level you only can hunt mule deer cottontail rabbits you must own a capable gun to shoot them not included with the free to play option and cannot host multiplayer games only may join them this game really shines when you put some money into it and unlock various other weapons access to hunting all animals the developers have definitely figured out the free to play monetization system almost everything costs real money however looking past the monetization system this is easily one of the best hunting simulations on personal computer i have ever played you definitely do not need to invest any money at all if you done mind only using a two hundred and forty three rifle hunting mule deer i highly recommend this game even in the limited free to play form May
how to play laura clicker one install come on do it its free witness moaning anime girls break your mouse and or your fingers buy new mouse change your hand repeat from step i regret nothing one thousand and ten
a great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanics fractured space is a a beautiful game with great visual and sound design it has a very heavy focus on teamwork so being polite cooperating and reading your allies and your enemies behaviour is key you will need to learn and fast each ship similar to hero in other mob and mob ask games has is strengths weakness and purpose understanding how to play each ship is key most games follow a fairly similar pattern cap mines fight for gamma attack enemy base done let that fool you though just because the game has a mould doesn't mean you have to follow it each match will have its different fights and in each fight you might have to play slightly differently and if you emerge victorious from a fight you do feel a sense of pride however it is not without its flaws the first and most important one is balance with so many ships and so many factors to take into account the game could be said to be unbalanced and that wouldn't be wrong it would however be a very narrow view as a player with over five hundred hours playing spread over around two years live seen unbalanced in is and its done nothing but improve and the deus have done nothing but learn if slowly at times but the game int perfect when it comes to balance dare i say it will never be perfect but which game is the single biggest issue however is the match maker or my it uses a system called mar which is based on win victories and defeats to balance matches needless to say its not the best system its been endlessly debated moaned about changed tweaked and is a constant work in progress if i were you done get angry about it others will but just try to play the game help others and carry harder the second is to do with egg themselves having talked to the deus i know they are a great bunch of guys and girls that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone they just have a funny way of showing it sometimes from random experimental patches surprise launches or lack of communication egg definitely have their own way of doing things overall fractured space is a great game with fun and varied game play but not always balanced and with a zip my egg can seem to be a bit random at times but they mean well
early access review one of the best digital card games i have ever played it is super generous to the free to play with the rewards only downside is how jarring and long the tutorial is definitely give it a try if you like digital card games
deus have lost their sense of reality if a vehicles firepower needs to be nerved it from the game the stats are broken and lack any balance what so ever it looks good runs good but has zero accuracy on most aspects the game modes are also terrible lacking depth and intellect to even get a more real experience playing in more difficult game modes just means more dumb spawn rules the deus just pile on content instead of expanding on what they already have what good is adding ten more tanks and planes to the game if the game modes are to simple and boring would i recommend this game no
early access review this game was great and showed so much promise in december two thousand and fifteen but then the developers made a continuous series of radical changes and crashed this once great game in to the ground the reward system is brain dead and there is nothing epic about the loot free am have lost the plot December
early access review would recommend it cause its free to play that it i got banned in game for no absolute reason haven had any support team contact me even tho i send tickets all to this point live quit the game because of this negligence
team fortress two is the best free play first person shooter in the world today its pure free play which means that everything is available at the beginning you done have to spend money on this game except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items so what is this game all about well you play in team of one to twelve or even more players and you try to beat the other team team fortress two features several game modes capture point and payload for example and nine classes each class has its own pros and cons and can be used for specific tasks for example the engineer is a great defender and the scout is very effective in capture based game modes team fortress two is very a friendly since the game features offline training against bots and tutorials as well as the corp tower defense game mode mann is machine team fortress two is a relatively simple game you done require a lot of knowledge to be good at it the game also has a large economy of items which you get by playing or trading these are pure cosmetic except most weapons and done give you an advantage towards other players verdict this game is very enjoyable and funny its very different compared to other first person shooter games it features several awesome game modes and funny classes some of the cosmetics are really funny you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example an awesome free play shooter you should play today your friends will not see you outside for at least one hundred hours if you become a team fortress two trader you will spend at least four hundred hours on this game score eighty nine thousand one hundred
if you have a penchant for feeling completely let down by your teammates if you want to see team mates ignoring the objective and dying under towers in places they should never have been after fighting hard for nearly an hour and seeing defeat snatched from the jaws of victory this is the game for you no it really is do you have an unyielding sense that the participation aspect of team mates in communicating effectively to engender positive cooperation in fulfilling victory after victory in both the battles of defending and attacking and the war as a whole is absolutely necessary then providing you have the ability to speak russian spanish and portuguese and understand that even though you have chosen to play on an english speaking server you are likely going to be in the minority and everything that goes wrong is going to be your fault waste no time install this game and jump in the incredibly forgiving and supportive community is waiting to help teach you how to play you to will soon have a mar and can hang out in the geddit chat with the rest of the thirteen thirty sevens motorists and just remember this one thing and you will never go wrong if someone has a lower mar than you no matter what the issue is they are always wrong welcome and golf
if you like flying air planes then you will most likely love this game like others have mentioned the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying but then the experience is really rewarding if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process now in my book there are three types of fans when it comes to flying games lets see one the first type only want to grab the stick or keyboard and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else if you are from this type then go for battlefield series hawk or war thunder it center done bother with digital combat simulator you will have hours of fun with the other titles that i mentioned and trust me there are some really good ones out there and live personally tried most of them two this type of fans love flying and done mind getting into some details about planes but they done want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details if you belong in this category look up flaming cliffs three on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading three these are plane nerds they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an air lane they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading go download digital combat simulator and have fun thank me later now if you are the first type done bother with digital combat simulator there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun digital combat simulator is for the other two types if you love flying but done want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics then you re in the right place digital combat simulator has no clickable cockpits in different planes where you done have to know what every single switch does you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you re willing to do so you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft but here is the thing you can by flaming cliffs three and get so many planes at a decent price if you go for digital combat simulator you will have to buy each plane separately expect for the two included in the free version the choice is up to you but keep reading finally if you are from the last type then you just have to grab your stick hop in a plane and start your journey there are clickable cockpits in the game where you actually need to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up take off navigate it center its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me there an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with look no further because digital combat simulator not only brings you a realistic experience but it has better graphics and in game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now go look for yourself and compare this gem to fax or fig and see the difference as a final note some say the planes are expensive i believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent but before purchasing any make sure you look for the frequent sales on the digital combat simulator website usually you can by all planes for seventy off and more if you purchase multiple planes so then you wont have to cry over your empty wallet just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal i say again if you re from the second type consider going with digital combat simulator flaming cliffs three you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately
in giving this game a thumbs down because of the bugs and errors that make the game at time completely unplayable if i claim some land in my world in game and suddenly cant see the blocks that i am placing cant see the blocks that i removed because they still appear to be there for a build game that is the worst i tamed like twenty pets set them to stay yet they all vanish above or below the area they were set to stay or they end up all together in one area that is awful in not sure if it show my game time but it is nine hundred and twenty nine hours writing this nine hundred and twenty hours were all played completely free i was playing this game since two thousand and sixteen when it was in early access and recorded some game play and even did some live streams unfortunately i made the mistake of purchasing pro in october twenty eighteen during the halloween sale and haven really played the game since why you ask all the problems i said above i done want to support a company that lies in october their company playful corp had a artwork contest and wrote rules to the contest only to break them and in the process exclude those that met all the written rules i will not support a company playful corp that lies and refuses to admit and correct the problem of a contest the company held playful corp i will not be buying any of your future products ladies and gentlemen please take a look at the screenshot proof that proves they are liars i have underlined circled and numbered it i rest my case in this very obvious open and shut case that they are guilty of this tips steam community insure i also give a suggestion for a possible solution to fix and correct the problem and here are more award two more or how about fifteen more playful corp seems to refuse and ignore a month and a weeks worth or asking for public response to why do this so how will playful corp stop doing this when some say they have done it in past contests it is real simple and i will tell everyone done call them contests if they are just giveaways with no rules all you would have to say is enter this giveaway at this time and it ends when winners get announced then an option to share artwork or a build or something else that is suggested by playful corp do that then no problems ever enter optional October
graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don to look too long at it paint exam play got very good good its just game play mesh starring at walls is better just don audio orgasm very good good not too bad bad array audience kids teens adults average solitaire player pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boil iii ask casa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press a easy significant brain usage easy to learn hard to master difficult dark soul grind nothing to grind only if you care about leader drinks int necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you all need a second life for grinding story if you want story then go read a book text or audio floating around average depends an downloadable content good lovely it all replace your life game time long enough for a cup of tea short average long to infinity and beyond price there is no price worth the price if a have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying assassins creed unity get a bug spray or more a lot more or maybe a flamethrower or a nuke in conclusion get the game
early access review good game a little bugs in cliffs and mountains as disappear on the ground cant change hair colour and no eur server it has much to improve and very similar to pub mobile
early access review one of my favourite games on steam extremely fun to turn on whenever there are friends over couch party is awesome and there not much more i could ask from this game
just a pimped down mobile version of yugo buggy and not worth your time the tutorials in game arrive too late and only belittle anyone playing this only compounds on the fact that they are part of the progression in game furthermore you have new levels of rarity like super rare and ultra rare their rarity often tied to how useful or good a card is this in turn gimps the game for anyone who hast played a while limited deck slots is also a thing that is forced on the player full screen is not enabled by default the guy is designed for a mobile phone and you often have terrible lag between menus and actions lastly even the game play mechanics are pimped there is no main phase two for example i could go on but you get the list done waste your time
major memory leak problem with trove sixty frames per second will drop to fps on a gtd and multi gnu live tested trio wont do anything to fix this problem they just want you to buy more credits and done care to fix anything
early access review died to a no arm or guy riding around in a truck and got panned when i shot him five times with full he and full arm or with a semi shotgun and that was after i got hit markers on him with the assault rifle forty even in the truck and he still killed me so either lag or some hacker either way fix the pan and the game would be fun
my points are all first impressions the good things about this game no gender lock classes different races so far character creation the bad things about this game sluggish movement camera is annoying combat is terrible instants world in two thousand and eighteen
it is a pay to play game even though it says free to play you can only get a few guns without using real money overall if it want pay to play i would give it a seven hundred and ten i done recommend this game unless you want to spend money on it
early access review pros decent character customization i really liked the fact you can tame pretty much anything cons where do i begin graphics are not up to par with what i expected yes its an older engine but the world just looked so bland and boring optimized first person shooter was way below what it should be for the computer i had as a founder my rewards were locked to the first character i created also you can only create four characters per server on top of that i was forced into a faction content that was promised was not released in end game i was also getting drops for classes that they had said they would release at a later date everything felt too easy you could solo the first two dungeons you could auto path to every quest no area while this might be fine for a game like do where there is no flight path to anything this game has multiple fast travel methods poor translation of skills notifications you are now level attack for twenty six and make gain one rage i felt that given this game has been out six years the level of polish in this game was not up to par it just felt clunky and unrefined and i did try multiple classes and found it the same old i had low expectations and it still didst meet those expectations i paid for the deluxe edition ninety three can and thankfully i was able to get a refund i will maybe give this a try later on when they i dunno actually finish creating the game
early access review this is bob copy and paste him so he can take over the workshop
access review game got destroyed by patching and try to evolve a good game into a bad game also removing classes and adding bots this game is no special anymore then every other battle royal classes feel useless and everything feels clunky bring the game back to the alpha stage and you will earn way more money then actually from this state of this game
early access review spent so many hours with this masterpiece making a vary types of things including but not limited to a bird a flying ship from treasure planet star wars fighters and many more this game is like a min craft but with an ability to create a robot vehicles and destroy other players creations will give this one thousand and ten for sure whats better yet this a truly a free player versus player games there is no pay to win of such sort its all depends on your creations
basically counterstrike but with more wizards more russians and less teamwork also similar to low would play any of these champs again update would you look at that they even added wrong now and moved baron to the correct side of the map good job riot
business tour online multiplayer board game this game be quite fun with a group of friends the game does have some bugs such as were a player lags and teleport around or moves to a wrong space but overall its a fun game i wish it was more similar to monopoly but overall its a good game for being free
now i understand why people are spamming bad game this one is unplayable on a laptop graphics is way to early optimisation is maybe less combat is clunky i do not recommend such a game ill never try playing it again
early access review aircraft was a super fun and promising game it gave you a lots of creative freedom with your builds but rob craft is no longer fun after its last update it took away the feeling of progression by making everything pay to win the people who are willing to pay for it will win the game by having all the late game unlock that anyone just can pay for now on their build all the tons of in game currency that i had worked my butt of to get is now deleted and all i had saved up for i could no longer afford and now i wont ever be able to crates premium a game pay to win is the worst decision a game development can make and its not even finished yet i feel so sorry rob craft suffered a premature death rip you'll be missed
played the game during prerelease and it was pretty fun now i cant play with it without an incredibly boring intro cinematic followed by a uselessly long and unstoppable tutorial mission which i do not need wanted to blow my brains out after ten minutes dropped out of tutorial to avoid certain suicide will play when i can skip
if you are going to spend real money or a good amount of time in this game save your save games by yourself or you will one day maybe lose everything like me your entire vault will be gone and you will have to start from zero you ask why because the save system is garbage wouldn't recommend such a horrible experience but if you are point to play this you now know what to do
trove was a good game you can play this very well without paying any real world money buy now since the last few patches this game is not friendly to the new players you need more
one of the better free to play entries on the market for certain the deus take such an anti stance that in actually really amazed and tempted to spend money since the games not a black hole vortex for it like most free to play areas have really been done to death and most really a rent that different from one another but i feel path of exile really stands out due to a number of innovative approaches to old problems levelling and screwing yourself and worthless currencies in particular i can genuinely say that i like character progression better than diabolo ii its still doesn't capture the holy crap moments of diabolo ii loot or have the presentation of the gold standard either but it sure as hell does both of those better than the cancer that is diabolo only thing i hate is server lag the fanboy crew irrationally blame peoples internet but its clearly the games server it only happens occasionally but when it does its at a level high enough to be quite frustrating
access review the game has massive potential and is a lot of fun but its privacy policy is disgusting i advise everyone to actually read it before installing and for this reason this gets a bad review from me
two words spawn camping give it a two hundred and ten the game itself is rather fun maybe a seven hundred and ten game with room for improvement on the few games that all players are doing the usual dogfights and bombing runs but every now and then you will run into a clan who has the exact spawn locations marked and they will a line straight to it and for the next five minutes your team will absolutely not be able to get a plane out the spawn camping in this game is entirely game has completely destroyed it take my word and just steer clear the game int good enough to justify retaining such an incredibly outdated play style
the game is getting more and more pay to win no matter how good or long you played they put more and more overpowered cards you can only pay to get story mode is really cool but the core game is now unplayable even low rank now exploit because they easily can no matter what those twenty twenty hours playtime the guru wannabes and git god trolls are saying on the community forums those fez win cards i couldn't manage to get after all my playtime since i used the in game money to play the story story which bow i yet didst fully unlock yes i only played half the payt access part of the game after two hundred and fifty hours and now i cant even manage to beat the crushing overpowered cards i tend to always see when i want to play the base game i had a great time playing this game feels like long ago but it is now a fun and unfair i gave this game more chances to entertain me but he is now really too disappointing
early access review think people are highly going overboard with the negative reviews the games still in early access still being added to and adjusted and some how in twelve days people think they know everything about it and that its problems will never get fixed firstly i must say out of all the early access games live played in the last few years this has been one of the better ones if not the best only one or two maintenance on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day roughly about two hours all in all it was down for on the first night for maintenance so i think its doing fine the game itself is quite fun there a bunch of things to do nothing that hast been done before but still a variety and it doesn't feel like a massive chore the combat is fun for a tab target game the combo system makes it interesting i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a a button ash fest and you have to think about what your using and how to utilise the stances to get the most of possible the problems atm are quite normal for any recently released massively multiplayer online and i can deal with that it will get better with time only problem i have which is just a preference is that some classes i want to play a rent out mostly assassin but that not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out another issue i would like to pick up on though this failed in other regions and is a old game according to some its been tweaked quite a bit for us and they keep on tweaking it just have patience i still feel like it has promise and i hope people give it a go because be wiz are actually really trying as a company to live up to what people here want which is surprising since i cant think of many companies who would actually go to the lengths they did to make this build of the game for us it is similar but at the same time very different to the other builds it has in other regions i hope it has a steady success and helps people remember what mos are for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it popple or other
as an experimental gamer i found this game quite fun however there is one key issue with the game that everyone will experience the current issue at hand is lag i done know where the servers are located but if you and a friend play this game expect it there will be moments where you will get disconnected when entering a portal moments when you will stand there and wait a minute before actually accessing the portal seeing as how this is the only piece of uncertainty to not download this game i would defiantly recommend the game because live been playing it for a week straight nonstop those of you with any questions or concerns go ahead and drop a comment on my profile if i find this question reasonable i will add you and discuss it
do not install this game my account was hacked and banned for betting support refuses to investigate unable to appeal will never be able to play thanks to support staff
i downloaded this game thirteen hours ago i have eleven hours on this game at the time of writing this review i think i have my new addiction it is totally worth playing especially as its free although i did have to wait a while to log on to start with the wait was definitely worth it cube world is fancy
early access review in the short time i played this game me and my friends noticed factory is a rip off of dust two from counter strike global offensive also the engine has a critical issue of lag when you press a button on mouse or keyboard there is an extreme delay between the button being pressed and what actually happens on screen also the maps are spawn trap city please update the spawn system in this game we were able to spawn trap very easily these are game breaking issues that need to be addressed and for the fact that they copied dust two is just the last straw
worst matchmaking in a mob live seen for a long time chance that you find normal teammates is equal to zero and for your dismay enemy team is all ways full of fully mastered gods and probably maldives if you want to play go only coop because normals are going to kill your sanity quicker than league or counter strike global offensive and even data two
its quite saggy and sometimes your dragon will disappear also it doesn't fit your screen resolution and you cant exit without alt tab the clicking exit its a waste of space for thirteen go so done waste your time and space for it

early access review this game is good but it has a few bugs what i enjoyed was the fact that it reminded me about the two dimensional version and that it uses pretty much the same maps what i didst like its inventory just didst work so i would say it should be fixed it has been a month or two since i have played it so hopefully they fix the bug
early access review this might really be the end of artie entertainment why make this ugly looking three dimensional game adventure quest worlds had an enormous fan base they had good two dimensional artists and they got a lot of money mostly because of appearance items adventure quest worlds was good but outdated they just had to spice the mechanics a bit perhaps making a turn based game like was focus would be the best solution but no lets make an amateur three dimensional modelled game focused for mobile users everyone gonna love that idea artie entertainment what where you thinking
after thirty one hours of playing i lost my save the game froze and my laptop with it after relaunching i was greeted with no vault only the possibility to create a new one i read that this is common amongst players long ago so i done understand why doesn't the team do something with the problem disappointed
i like this game because it is fun to play with friends and can make me smile when time bored for me it still doesn't beat monopoly but because of the time it takes to play it can be more practical that and its free i have found when playing online with other people it can be frustrating when someone goes ask because you have to wait for the timer to run out on their player i wouldn't mind if this happened a few times if it happens twice then the player should be kicked from the game but anymore than a few waits is annoying this int a problem when playing with friends another problem i have found is that you must have the game fully loaded in before joining a friends game or it will crash the game these are the only problems i have found i would recommend this game to anyone wanting something fun to do with friends
this game is really just an arcade shooter that a bunch of people can play at the same time done go in expecting a lot of opportunities for interaction or anything other than the most basic features of an massively multiplayer online role playing game slightly disappointing because the general concept was such a great idea but hopefully they'll be adding new content in the future in the meantime its just fun enough to warrant giving it a try plus its free with a cash shop that doesn't ruin the game
early access review did recommend it but now i don to recommend this game to nobody seems like eighty of the people playing uses hacks and trust me they will destroy your experience its a shame that such company doesn't seems to invest enough in protecting this game from hacks if you don to trust me start playing and take a look on how many impossible circumstances other players will kill you take a look at youtube you'll find an immense number of hacks for it would like to receive my money back if possible because its very unfair waste it this way
what has happened to the game i once knew and loved me and my best friend were searching for some games to play we got bored of team fortress two and found trove at the time you had to download the glyph client in order to play but we didst mind we played a lot had so much fun and i had that much fun that i got ahead of my best friend by a lot then shadow towers got introduced to the game and it was fun to battle to titan bosses i would always be one of the last players standing with my endgame acolyte then it all changed the game i once knew and loved vanished it became a grinding game where the pay to win players would most of the time have the upper hand classes became pay to get and their reason was to make players feel different from others it pretty much didst change anything i wouldn't have minded but the developers are the most laziest the servers are most of the items are community created right now they keep on doing the same events do some quests get a reward that int worth it and the amount you had to farm for it was just dumb i have around one thousands hours experience and i can say that i wish they could just revert back to the beta and the new players think they are so smart saying to like the game is not pay to win it is not bad and keep on arguing if they were here in the beta they would have known why we even starter an argument about the the game is seriously trio world if you wish to become a better company you can start by fixing the load of bugs you have some that are still here and have since the beta and get rid of most of the pay to win
after years of playing this game since two thousand and twelve i have finally grown some interest in writing this review and i want to start by saying if you haven played this game already just do do it its a free game and its unique you wont find similar experience it is intense it is heavy combat it shreds your personal computer in half because of so much happening at the same time and has people using their mics with battle cry and war songs you will die a lot its the dark souls of massively multiplayer online you will die but yet you will feel happy because of so much fighting take your time to enjoy the game done try to rush things and get bored quickly done base your opinion on the game on others play it and you will discover for sure that there is still great potential in a six year old game its the only game that can hook me up for an entire day of battle also finding a good outfit is a must have for one hundred enjoyment inside the game and also to have someone to teach you things planet side has a lot of problems but those problems done take the light out of the game go out there and fight for aura ricardo
early access review overall its a good game that is free who can complain about that right good game play with a decent community can grind out any and all items in game so it is most definitely not a pay to win starting off int the most pleasant experience but once you get a decent gun the game improves tremendously the new upcoming build is going to change the game quite a bit with reno development revamping all the maps with new buildings and layouts i think it will work out nicely but only time will tell
early access review immensely fun and enjoyable better than most battle royal games in my opinion malware rumours are rumours and will be rumours live looked into every claim into my personal computer no such thing happening probably just footnote fans afraid of losing value of their accounts
early access review this is probably the most disappointing game live played the old game its so different it could easily be a different game had fun challenging game play but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact definition of a pay to play this includes overpowered weapons that one shot new players impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all premiums get twice as many items from crates as no premiums playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to i could go on for hours the largest problem live encountered is players attaching a really overpowered weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cup enough to get into new players matches meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot this mainly occurs with the new aero flak cannon which in early games destroys any ground targets even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun secondly the insane cost of items so you play a match come first in the team and win gaining a plutonium crate and gain some stuff you done want so you sell it and gain maybe three hundred money now you want to buy something of wait you cant because even the cheapest gun costs four hundred and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases so you play another match but there someone with an aero flak by the way did i mention that the aero flak costs seventy five thousand to buy but that not even the most expensive item there is the lock on rocket launcher another commonly used cheat weapon costs one hundred and twenty five thousand to buy and i bet that leaves you wondering but how do i get that well the sad answer is you done or at least without spending more money anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find some more junk this has basically described what the game feels like for no premiums but wait what if you are a premium well other than costing a ton of money a single day costs one it is very good access to all the paints yes that only for premiums twice the items from crates custom profile pic act all of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just done care enough anymore to change it they've gotten too greedy with money to think is this a good fun game one hundred and ten huge disappointment
i know in only eight hours here but in well over one hundred on is just wanted to comment about how in sure the new tower has helped with the flow of the game but i done like what its done for the feel of the game or the farm for cosmetics i liked being able to drop into a power level range and see all sorts of different types of biome instead of just having the biome correlate to certain power level ranges like they do now its a lot more fun if i can grind stuff that i want to grind that relevant to my level while mostly staying in biome types i want to play need cosmetics from if in missing something please someone let me know
early access review started playing a few days after release it was phenomenal realm royal or has the best battle royal concept it brings shooters and mos together within a battle royal universe the class aspect is not even its biggest selling point it was notice past sense the concept incentive to hunt other players players would drop currency to craft better weapons gear unfortunately there were a couple of poor choices the games current state is too ring focused despite the fact elements were added that already were reverted the first time they chose to add them the direction of this game is not clear what is clear is that the player base gets smaller after every poorly chosen change this game has the potential to be very very big i guess we will have to wait for blizzard to create a battle royal where classes are a thing
early access review its actually very fun and the guns system is unique no pay to win hope dive keep developing one thing i hated is that i opened the golden box like six times and i only got the stupid smoke grenade a
if you played and or play the normal yugo card game i do not recommend this its a sad imitation done get me wrong its oddly enjoyable i mean i put in six hours into it and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then thirty minutes but its not something i can take seriously min play ranked classic battle always disconnect and ask me to reboot fix your connection error issue on player versus player kenai no balanced player versus player bronze rank is gold rank are a kidding me kong ito many card buy card must use diamond or trade so for what there is gold and last i have played many different yugo this one has many card included so it could be nice but with just three spaces each for monsters and spell rap cards this just ruins the game the game is meant to be played with many monsters effects and spells trap cards in play and three spaces each just doesn't cut it maybe they would change it later but now it is just boring to bad
early access reviewing just gotten the game this last week and as much as i love it i cant help feel there a massive imbalance going down i mean in only a lvi two done laugh and in being pitted against players that have lasers that slice through your dam ship they seem to zip across the battle space laugh out loud no wonder in getting a kicking i guess this just means ill have to buckle up keep upgrading though in sure boobs such as myself can be pitted with a matching class however all being said i still love the game will keep upgrading you can also spend cash to help speed shit up from what live seen there are a few playing it like this and if you like to stay ahead then you will have to spend a little cash getting there though you could still play for free if you wanted great graphics excellent scenes wicked sounds great space battles
early access review have been looking for something like hearthstone and i believe i have found it in this game there have been some comments about not getting the right cards at the beginning but a redraw usually gets me in the right direction the artwork is nice and there is a nice story to follow that upon completing each battle you get cards it seems to be a bit more complicated that hearthstone but in a good way you really have to think ahead rather since the opponent can choose to defend or not overall a very nice game which i plan to continue playing for quite a while also although it is indeed completely free to play and one could play this without spending a dime there is a nice two hundred and ninety nine that gets you three packs and a load of gems i find that to be a nice small purchase that supports the game but doesn't commit a ton of money very much worth the two hundred and ninety nine
it has its moments its not exactly the best thing that ever hit steam its a little buggy and they want you to pay for everything but looking past that its alright partial thumbs up
early access review its cute yes for the most part and things jump out at you from the walls cardboard cutouts in fact but when you start to be chased by things and then up pops something in front of you it really does make you jump and than laugh and then run away again from whatever is following you recommended for anyone who wants a heart attack
wow has a better subscription model than this game want to hunt any given animal you see fifteen bucks a year get into the game with the idea of being an evil poacher and shooting all of the deer game says you cant shoot that god says no worst payment model ever which then ruins the rest of the game
update game or bring the old game back very simple fixes i must say from my personal development experience no reason why you should be ignoring your supporters not saying you are but its starting to feel that way in recommending this game as a means of support because i wanna see a good free survival massively multiplayer online like this could be in the future please
it might be a good program if the key bindings didst randomly stop working if it didst randomly refuse to boot up and if it didst randomly and repeatedly seem to introduce bugs into itself maybe it worked for vista but its rubbish under win ten
early access review used to be a great game until the epic loot update completely destroyed it there is now zero progression its all ring through loot crates weapons are completely unbalanced and the economy has been totally ruined shame on you free am for going down the money grabbing route to all newcomers stay away from this game until they hopefully fix it or revert back before this latest update
well there some good and some bad that came out of this the good is that i can completely disassemble and reassemble a dec blindfolded with one hand but the bad is the dec is essentially useless because it jams more often then a suckers factory
early access review abandon all hope be who installs this wretch with the addition of the epic loot update things have gotten quite when a match ends you get a stupid crate which may or may not give you something that worth a damn you can sell those items for about one thousand and twenty of their actual price thank god they didst keep the insane multimillion price tags for some of the stuff because the most common item you'll be getting is loftier gadgets and blocks neither of which are worth a lot gun energy seems to be whacked being unable to shoot with more than half of the energy bar left is annoying at best and infuriating at worst the deus care little of their game and their players and instead resort to petty excuses and dismissing reviews like this one and comments as boring weapons are not balanced especially considering the lag compensation system is not going to help you how do you like getting shot through mountains the screenshots on the store page are deceptive and are not up to date for instance the medic gun which looks like it shoots continuous beams does not do damage anymore the worst part about the game though is the player base while it is true that they have complained about many things that really weren't all that important that is not what makes them bad some people say that the players are actually better than those in laugh out loud or data two but do not be fooled the players here are victims of a lobotomy gone horribly wrong you will face teammates that are insanely incompetent making you wonder if they have ever touched a computer before you will rarely be matched with half decent or even good teammates your teammates will let enemies drive by them without as much as noticing them they will fail to assist you they will always have extreme tunnel vision in short they will always fail it is insanely infuriating to see them fail at the most simple of things like you know shooting the enemy that in front of them but this is just an early access game of course people are going to hate the updates heres the question how long does it take for a game to establish its ideas its vision its identity five years ten years i think not for a game as simple as this staying in alpha for so long is simply shameful the game had at least two total makeovers to my knowledge how much longer does this alpha stage need to go on as long as the excuse can be abused the removal of tiers the tech tree the megabits some people were not too happy with it i want too thrilled myself but i persevered epic loot update in afraid i cant care any longer especially when the deus throw around passive aggressive comments about their player base take the review as you will abandon all hope be who installs this wretch may
not much to say about this game you can play on most computers doesn't matter how bad it is if you liked the games like super smash bros act than you need to download this game the controls are easy to get the the hang of usually no lag what so ever there are many legends to pick from and even buy within game currency if you like weekly rotations are a very good aspect edit unbalanced of talking hammer and axe recommend this game to anyone
this game is simply cheating players a bit is to extract as much money as possible strange card matching adjustable ranking games with the strongest decks against yours total lack of balance where the card simply wins the game the worst thing is that the game is set so that when you buy new boosters you get the cards in such a way that they are not random only allocated top down review the progress of the number of cards in the profile the game was done to make money not for players satisfaction remember this when you spend money on i playing to one victory is a complete failure the one who gets the cards better wins lack of sideboard game reduces to random card matching and the total lack of the opportunity to prepare for the opponent i understand the mtg clone requires new solutions after all thirty years of magic is a poor experience to show how the game should look balance game is zero all tactics and strategy die in pain in one turn when the opponent throws a card that is bent which itself destroys the whole game the authors consider themselves great creators to create cards that play themselves you like frustration and pain i invite you to play you prefer to play tactically and think play paper stone scissors there is more thinking there
very good game it feels and plays just like day day minus the brilliant zombie a i and advanced game mechanics this game has everything except days best bits the endless running and bugs that is where the game shines ten minutes of running followed by a crash to desktop i would gladly pay two hundred smack room for this free to play heap of fresh manure play it now
after seven hundred and twenty if you done play the meta characters right now you wont win team comps at higher levels look well rounded towards the bottom tiers they whole team needs to be carries and only met carries the majority of players are low tier so this is most of the players experience the recent buff to certain characters make some supports one it killers late game and other broken i used to think this game was better than league because the various build paths and play styles but it seems like you must go a certain path to win games and only that path if you want to play various characters that might not be meta and still have a shot at winning done play this version of data two go play league or another mob that is growing this game doesn't satisfy like it used to and by the way they've been making changes it doesn't look like it will change in a better direction soon uninstall and come back a couple years later
product received for freeware going to war time to grab the bicycle the comment above was just a joke but this game does have problems which the deus in most cases are not dealing with instead the only thing they seem to be doing is adding more things to grind for nothing else to enjoy this game you have to grind or pay i have put eight hundred and six hours into this game biggest mistake ever and i still done have everything i would ideally want the thing which is sad about this game is that as a concept it had so much potential and i think for the most part that is why i put so many hours into the game just because i always thought at some point this game might get better but now after all these years i cant say the game is worth the time and yes i know someone will end up saying its free to play the only thing i can say to that is it is not you pay for the stuff you want with money or time i made the stupid decision i done want to give the game a rating or anything but i hope this helps
early access review fun game that has a bit of a learning curve very small player base usually only about sixty thousand one hundred and ten people on at anytime never had a wait to play though just saw a lot of the same names up to you wether that good or bad most ships play very differently and you have to adjust your play style to match otherwise you'll have a bad time good communication with deus and they regularly release updates for the game
this game is absolutely amazing this is definitely a game that would fall under the clicker idle category though when i think about it it seems like an exact five thousand and fifty between the two in really enjoying this game and have already gotten addicted i haven played the fallout series so i cant call myself a longtime fallout fan or anything but live heard the fallout series is amazing and this is definitely a great game and by great developers ten million eleven thousand a
early access review have been apart of this game since well before it came to steam i have seen well not much improvement they continue to add shinny items but fail to fix the glaringly broken ones frequent crashes funky user interface zero clan system broken and unbalanced weapons wonky maps buggy vehicles weapons and terrain it seems with the last build this game is looking for whales they want players to come in and dump tons of real cash to advance be warned this game is a huge grind it will take you years to advance a to on years unless of course you want to spend tons of real cash on it every new build brings new bugs and in balance do not waste your time here folks for new players you will think its all great until you hit level three or five then you will see how screwed up the game really is three years running now and its still in beta the engine is old and looks like of the video on the store page are not the real graphics but an embellished version done do it folks read all the recent reviews we the player base are saying the same thing over and over
early access review the game is really good for an alpha i noticed most last negative reviews are from people that don to understand what an alpha is ill give a more in depth review when they all stop deploying big changes every weeks and the game enter beta
fallout with sim theme tower reminds me of golden age bullfrog games with a dash of maxis and a bethesda topping you cant go wrong its more of a mobile background game than anything else though it was developed as a mobile game meant to be played in short bursts and its totally a one thousand and ten at that
early access review have a lot hours in this game and i think i can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game also the review in giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competitively than casually lets start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldn't be in here seventy five card decks the decks that you make have to be seventy five cards instead of the standard sixty that are common in most other games this makes dec building and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare there are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game and trust me i built them but with seventy five cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced the deck size should be sixty cards and then you have a fifteen card side board though sideboards done matter in this game either and ill explain later mulligan doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb in this game if you done like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause you re stuck with it let me give you an example of how it should be if you ever played magic the gathering another better card game before the way their system works is like this you start with seven cards if you done like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six if you still done like your hand you can go down to four cards if you still done like your hand you can go down to three though this never happens it center it center the point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason coin flip normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you have to go first now in other games when you do a coin flip the winner has the option if they want to go first or not i know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first it doesn't happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to this is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesn't trust their player base to make their own decisions best out of one this is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustrating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore for some reason ranked matches are a best of one basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank sometimes in games you are bound to get unlucky with draws but that why in most other cards games when you play competitively you play your opponent the best of three for the life of me i have no idea why the game is like this i cant begin to tell you how absolutely frustrated you will feel when you are playing ranked and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you cant cause eternal only allows two for some reason and you wind up losing the game cause of it but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up its absolutely ridiculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competitive play unbalanced cards some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken and by that i mean you essentially have no way to lose some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essentially has no way to win the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first live played tons of other card games before magic hearthstone yugo pokemon and i can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards live ever seen drawing sucks finally the last point that i want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game for drafting in eternal you a rent drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here these drafts a rent with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is fort five cards this int as much of a big deal since you draft forty eight cards in total but i just find it odd also draft matches are not the best out of three they are again the best out of one its so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it so if you get awful hands well too bad fucking you cause now you lose the match here is the good things about eternal its free and it will only take

a negative review on duel links from someone with fifty hours in the game on steam alone who has created a community guide and logged over one hundred and twenty consecutive days in the past year on the mobile version blasphemy yeah i know but let me explain myself before you crucify me duel links int a bad game in fact its a great game that live loved playing and that live enjoyed from day one despite the micro transactions and sometimes unforgiving meta duel links has been arguably the best yugo game ever made and kenai has shown dedication to both supporting its players and to regularly updating the game with fresh and exciting content as a whole i applaud kenai and what they've managed to accomplish in the year since duel links global release this review int about the quality of the game though rather its about my personal experiences playing duel links religiously for a year and why live decided to take a step back from the game going forward long story short i think live been addicted i mean it when i said live played this game religiously that the attitude that both the game and the community promote if you want to stay in the competitive scene and keep up with the constant barrage of new cards being added to the game you are regularly encouraged to log on daily spending a couple hours here and there to grind for experience points and reach the max level with your due lists which is the main way to earn the in game gem currency needed to buy more cards you'll spend hours auto duelling pcs while pretending you can focus on other tasks in between when really your mind is preoccupied with how you'll soon have to queue up your next duel and how much longer it will take you to reach the next level or stage i got into this game because i loved yugo as a kid and the idea of a free to play mobile game that was regularly updated and supported felt exciting and nostalgic beyond words but i never expected to spend almost every day of the past year playing this game or logging in for over one hundred and twenty days straight or how i would soon make excuses to play duel links when hanging out with my friends or going on coffee dates or even when just relaxing on the couch with my girlfriend when the game is always in reach your phone always nearby it becomes so easy to log on to check on the cool down on standard due lists or to find yourself playing yet another player versus player duel people around me starting complaining saying i was on my phone all the time but i insisted it want a problem and that i was still present and engaged in the conversations that would go on around me even if it want fully the truth at work at school at home on the bus i played everywhere anywhere but venturing onto the duel links sub edit a few weeks back i discovered that i want alone in struggling to balance my time spent on duel links with my everyday life and responsibilities so many other people have had these issues and multiple threads have been created to try and seek help from other players who didst even know they shared these problems duel links had become more than a daily routine for me and these posts were a wake up call i had a problem in still kind of taken aback by the whole experience and in not expecting everyone here to understand but as someone who played video games all their life i never thought a game could have the kind of hold on me that duel links has i felt compelled to open the game daily i had to so that i would continue my log in streak so that i could continue to earn more gems so that i could feel like i was keeping up with other players i hesitate to use the word addicted but my duel links habit had become downright unhealthy sunday was the first day in one hundred and twenty three that i did not log in to duel links it was a normal quiet afternoon i went to starbucks lounged around the house played over watch on my playstation four it want until after midnight had passed that i realized i haunt played duel links in twenty four hours and the understanding that my streak had ended and that i didst have to log in every day anymore if i didst want to was cathartic beyond words i know that not everyone will experience duel links the same way or the way that i have in not going to stop playing altogether either i meant what i said about duel links being the best yugo game on the market and live met some amazing people in the community that live bonded with over our ridiculous shared love for a children card game but since you cant leave a neutral review on steam i have to give it a thumbs down if just for the regret i feel knowing how much of the past year i spent glued to my phone this int meant to discourage anyone from playing duel links and as live said i highly recommend this game but please please be aware of how much time you spend on the game and done let it impact other areas of your life the way it impacted mine its okay to believe in the heart of the cards just done let them consume you
with the recent patches made to this game tier four is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against that is no the worst part anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than fifty it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to as i said the deus are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic they also do not listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and foreigner have firmly stated they are staying the censoring has gotten worse they have been threatening you tubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted this is a complete violation of youtube copyright system after the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtube who brought to light cheats people were using not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down this is yet again more abuse of youtube system and is also foreigner using their own community for personal gain do not play take a stand against the deus and show them that this will not be tolerated and cannot be forgiven
first impression is always important and i do not know how this game is since i cannot even start it spent good amount of time searching the official forum and geddit it forum to fix this problem and did all that i could to launch this game could be some technical issues or could be its just badly made now i am re editing to remove any trace of foreigner agent after deleting this game

this is the first review i have ever written so i done do this for no reason this game has a lot of potential i can feel that this could be a good game but its not as it is now the game auto levels you and chooses your skills which i very much dislike the game lags terribly in the main city which is normal in most mos due to the population the difference here is i was lagging a lot but i didst even see any other players the combat is very linear in the sense you hit a button and just follow the skill chain button mashing at its finest i looked in the cash shop and it looks very pay to win at end game honestly it was just sort of boring and with the lagging and the fact i didst see a single other player its just not fun so i do not recommend this game however if you feel the need to play it in sure you'll make up your mind within the first hour of playing that it should be deleted from your computer and sent to the recycle bin where it belongs sorry bless folks but this game needs a ton of work before it will be playable
after a strong year with several updates that improved the game considerably the developers have decided to worsen the already rough grind by substantially increasing the credit cost for new soldiers why they think this is a positive change for anyone i have no idea in the end its a great game ruined by its use hostile monetization model and this is why i cannot recommend it anymore your money or time is better spent elsewhere
its free pic moments that you wont see in any other game apart from playstation one its really the only mops out there once you re in a platoon its just so much fun graphics are good for a free game this size were talking about popup two thousands server folks tanks planes it all just feels so good solid gunplay the playstation two guys really do listen to the community its free not that optimised although they re working on that while posting it on youtube full feel lost the first hours not a lone wolf friendly game lets just keep it at that not the best net code although you cant have that with a game like this that in mind its actually pretty good although its not pay to win grinding guns is well a real grind est some more than other no fish a i its a really good game when you take the time to get into a big group and take the time to understand the game a game i would be gladly paid sixty for of wait its free people with group of friends on your own six hundred and ten its still possible and it still has its moments but its really not the same monitored grammar hashing
its just my god its full of stars i cant begin to describe how amazing it is the developers should be proud dim sure they are they made a fantastic massively multiplayer online sides roller it does take much to download and its user friendly one thousand and ten
done trust the trailers for this game one thing to make a cinematic trailer that has nothing to do with game play but doing a trailer of game play that looks like it went though a car wash of make up is sad good tanks planes runs poorly map layout and spawning is awful grind on top of upkeep fee to use anything upkeep fee not a fun kind of grin guns just done feel rights per bad user interface even worse squaring up interface
have you ever sat down and thought wow i wish i could combine risk pay to win gaming call of duty battlefield and team fortress two well this is the game for you with all the engagement of call of duty and pay to win fight in a battlefield like manner in a risk like environment this game gives you all of that one thousand one hundred and ten would get inst killed by a pay to win noon again
early access review very fun game pros have to progress and learn as you go lot of graphics great multiplayer cons monsters can be a little tough finding certain materials can be a challenge could have more of a tutorial for certain materials and how to find them over all its an amazing game downloaded it with my brother and friend played six hours straight it is now four fourteen am and i need to try and get some sleep
i can not open the game is asking for a code that was to be inserted when i opened the game for the first time someone help me when i click cd key he says failed to contact key server
i will keep play in this game but i do not recommend itchy you ask its cringe of not balance needs grind requires more time than my of and i do not have on it is easier to buy the skin cards for your deck in real life
i like this game its fun and it works for players who cant run the actual world of tanks i also like that i done need to buy modules so i can have up to the millions of credits well enough to buy four rounds or premium ammo i have in all tanks that can have it and to buy all three slots of came provisions and consumables so people saying its pay to win are incorrect
getting the game to properly recognize my controller and map it properly was too difficult user interface needs a major overhaul to make navigation easier too many user interface mimics and not enough function
early access review how ironic cuisine royal in the short amount of time it has been out is the culmination of the ideal battle royal game that pub wants to be performance wise or transcends pub clocking in at buttery triple digit frames for ample mid tier personal computer builds my heart races as i hear clanking pots and pans signifying imminent life death scenarios do i leave the duck to spoil or do i eliminate my nearing rival in hopes of salvaging his coveted cookware cuisine royal pushes your mind and stomach past their respective limits and you re going to learn the hard way when that heat gets out of the kitchen and into warfare see you on the battlefield chef
early access review this game its so charming and cute at least for the first part of the game its a very satirical game and it knows how to be satirical perfectly and best of all its absolutely free see
early access review valhalla is the perfect example of a platform fighter in my opinion in the state that it is now i can see it rivalling smash bros in the future this game shines and for it being a soon to be free to play game that makes it better
early access review the game is good but however i spend some money on random box there but mostly i get gold so this is the only issue they should remove gold at least from the box
its too damn addicting i have a life things to do goals to achieve i cant keep just checking on it every second to see it i can get another twenty five on my main dps or when a mission is done do not play this game if you want to do anything in life apart from playing it
to edit right now i have about fifteen million four million on parts in my inventory i can buy anything i want but its just not rewarding the general experience is just crap cause there barely is one the mechanics are okay the visuals could have been nicer there used to be skill now its just no skill spamming do yourself a favor and done play this piece of used to be really nice but i no longer like it the many updates ruined this game tech tree gone getting money without having to pay gone introduction to crates loot sucks
early access review just going to throw this out there first off some reviews are actually correct after reading about a page or two of reviews i decided to try it regardless thinking it might be a knockoff battlefield one thousand nine hundred and forty two and it kind of is in some sense it was fun at first until you reach rank three and then it all changes it turns into a completely pay two win game you do not stand a chance if you do not own tanks planes pilots tank crew men along with antitank vehicle weapons maybe it was just me trying to stay loyal and play with only my us troop when germany is clearly stacked and gets a lot more benefits in the war such as two spawning points more lives and their guns seem slightly better in general all in all i give this game a it has had a lot of potential but as most free to play first person shooter games it falls on pay to win in the end or really in the near start so enjoy your rank three trial then done bother unless you've got money to throw away
early access review this game is garbage its like playing counter strike on a nintendo sixty four its horrible guns have terrible damage its not very polished it buggy and boring as hell to play
i put over four hundred hours into this game now and honestly my opinion of it has only grown over the years when i first purchased this game as a early access i felt very let down they would wipe stats every few weeks and give us nothing for testing it out however after official release when the game went free to play they gave us a ton of cool skins and stuff and made up for it positives this game is not pay to win anyone can obtain premium currency they give out their premium currency like its candy you can buy any of the ships with premium currency but its wasteful better spent on skins because eventually your gonna have so many credits you done know what to do with them the game play is very fun the only disadvantage newer players have is there skill level this game is very similar to league of legends in that case negatives the learning curve is not terrible however you are likely to spend your first hundred hours grinding for ships you want to try out i recommend you watch all of the ship tutorial videos tips wow youtube co watch the game is still a work in progress even today they are often making changes to game play and replacing ship inclusion i would recommend the game it is a ton of fun and i still enjoy it every time i play it there is nothing more satisfying than winning a one a one or getting twenty kills and no deaths i do not recommend playing for wins you will only become sad a no matter what your going to lose some games but you can find joy in the combat it self or focus more towards your personal stats in the game
early access review ont spend a penny on this game just play free int buy any stuff chests will give you same thing over and over again in fact i have noticed people who spend no money get better drops then those who do
early access review adventure quest three dimensional is the third adventure quest game so far from what started as a simple but fleshed out in browser web game has gone to a side scrolling massively multiplayer online and now a fully three dimensional rpm honestly one the most underrated game series of all time adventure quest three dimensional only builds upon the already in depth lore not only did they recreate the original town of battle on in three dimensional but they also expanded upon the simplistic combat style of the original game but added a more engaging feel to fighting overall however i am a bit disappointed that they didst include the healer class from adventure quest worlds and the game has a wonderful sense of humour rather than do the runoff mill tutorial it thrusts you right in on the action while also adding in a sarcastic comment about it aqua three dimensional is simply not afraid to go against what has already been established in common rpm games and going for a morrow ind type of questing giving you a quest and a location and then having you go out and find the quest location and you simply cannot ignore the fact of the seamless integration of cross platform play between personal computer apple and android products i would have to give this game an eight hundred and ten and i can only imagine it will get better as time goes as artie entertainment updates their games frequently
nothing special here not even really worth your time i thought it might be an interesting game to see build up at least since i like the pixel graphics but its not its just a slow boring clicker upgrading buildings doesn't even really change the appearance only adding new buildings to your town does which happens maybe once every one thousand and thirty minutes and it just adds one building each building just makes new coins no variety in effect there an interesting good or evil choice but it doesn't affect what you re actually doing just a slight graphical change and some end game changes actually getting to that end game is still just as boring as the rest only play if you are an avid clicker fan casual fans or those looking for interesting experiences can pass if you like the graphics like me just admire them on the store page and save your time
product received for free its pretty good but i still get bullied at school i receive daily harassment for the same thing everyday why do you still play yugo i come running home everyday crying from the kids taunts as they make fun of my blue eyes white dragon i stare at my set kaaba poster on the wall waiting for my white knight to take me away from all my pain its midnight that i am still crying for the third time this week when i hear some movement behind my window i wonder who could that be at this hour i open the window to reveal daddy kaaba flying in a those shocked i am without words it is he who breaks the silence are you ready to call me king of games yuri i get into position as he pounds my for hours at first my body tries to reject his love but i am soon overcome with pleasure and accept his love after three hours we are finished and he flies out once more crying hah aha you never had a chance you pathetic due list ecstasy fills me to the brim at these words and i lie in my bed smiling nowadays i done cry at the kids taunts and instead await for daddy kansas return would use three blue eyes white dragons in my deck again
i played this emulator of infestation are before they had plans of releasing it on steam and take my word on this this emulator is how infestation should be played my buddy and i slay kids on this game and have loads of fun doing it but while this emulator is amazing it int perfect some history about this game you should know the creator freda is use to be an is hacker himself who got banned and decided to make his own emulator and anti cheat with it the irony in it all is the original developers of is who banned him initially praised him for his work and made new officially licensed by their company that where i kind of cringe when i play this game at times pros skins older skins can be purchased with go game dollars eventually is far from pay to win loads of are snipers and just looting in general just feels rewarding always and int a grind custom characters loads of maps including modifications to the older ones little to no hackers at all maybe came a cross one or two during my near one thousands hours of playing this emulator the developers actually listen and care about the community i say this because they shot themselves in the foot when they wiped snipers out of everyone i little over a year ago and lost a large amount of their fan base including myself and decided to bring them back after asking the community cons still uses the same crappy engine so optimization int in anyone favor still haven fixed the aim bug where bullets will randomly shoot elsewhere the spawns are terrible if you re out to jump into high pop player versus player campos especially people literally spawn on top of each other and at that point its a matter of who going to lose their spawn shield first and lose their she four man clans an issue that has ruined this games player versus player since i began playing trying to do small player versus player and having these clans of four five six even eight roll in mowing the place down int fun overall amazing emulator highly recommend this version of infestation to anyone that into piping
this game is a quite different idle game rather than simply adding up numbers and reincarnate to receive boost actually this game does similar thing but they way how this game works is more interesting this game offers a vast numbers of spells upgrades and buildings and what player needs to do is to select and explore different combinations the most interesting point is there are nine basic races from three fractions and each of these races have lots and lots of upgrades that may or may not conflict with each other this is the point where some strategic element comes you need to find the most effective build empowers one or several aspect as much as possible to achieve enough resources for abdication reincarnation to me the experience of this game is kind of like playing a role playing game game without plot but the role play parts are kept this system is sophisticated but it is good enough to outweigh its shabby graphics and completely silent game play the game has music now fascinating mAy
early access review it is a mobile game put on personal computer do not play it stay away i played for less than ten min and could not unless you have a touchscreen personal computer do not even try to play this
to be honest i didst expect much when i saw the first screenshots oho another cheap arg i realised very quick that path of exile was closer to diabolo ii which is awesome than diabolo iii actually is and the skill tree holy this skill tree is mind lasting you gotta focus what you do else you get lost this skill tree the ability granted by gems were maybe the reason i met in my first player versus player match a lightning bolt spamming warrior which was jumping with his big battle axe over the arena tearing me apart and i was like laugh out loud that looked but this is poe
the best game on steam above all else if you do not already own this game or intend on playing it i suggest you literally just shoot yourself here and now this game contains next gen graphics and game play with amazing multiplayer potential the fishing and farming simulation is second to none and because of this the game seconds as a solid alternative to either the game farming simulator or fishing simulator i definitely prioritize playing this game to either studying house work or even getting a job due to its amazing features with not a single bug would deeply reconsider what the actual i am doing with my life and also reconsider all of my life choices again
its a great game with a terrible community the game play is a lot like super smash bros only you can scale up walls each character has two weapons which drop onto the map as items they can pick up with standard weapon attacks on light attack and signature attacks on heavy attack matches run between four and eight minutes depending on game mode and one versus one is three stock unless special rules are applied in custom matches this game is a lot of fun to play online against other players or locally with friends there are no pay to win elements in this game so you can start playing and be on equal footing with someone who been playing for years if you get good at it all legend and color can be unlocked in game with gold which you earn after every match you participate in special outfits taunts and accessories for legends are bought with mammoth coins which cost real money but its all cosmetic and all of the legends look are perfectly awesome without them did i mention that the community for this game is also terrible absolutely toxic you'll see some of the cheapest most game breaking stuff you've ever seen in this game if you have high blood pressure or anger management problems beware sometimes you will quite the game in sheer frustration because of other players in fra you'll encounter keyboard macros that a rent even real players people who deliberately feed other players to rig the match spammers galore evasive who just waste everybody time and all sorts of other stuff that ruins the game you can win by a wide margin and still feel like the match was just completely ruined and all your time was wasted because of the things other players do in one versus one you'll encounter people who vibrate back and forth like they re trying to phase through something players that move and act more like self learning artificial intelligence programs than people not even necessarily good just completely unnatural and players that try to deny you weapons to keep an upper hand then say fez even when they lose if you can forgive a game for its players this game is amazing
i will review this fairly update of march they added a update where you can play all the ships for free in solo matches against bots which is great for proving ships and for people who done want to play with others the game has drops with various items got a three thousands platinum premium money skin from it this is one of the good games of free to play game play meh its pretty much same thing over and over and lack maps and game modes only two to choose from learning curve the first ship with us is crap at least from my point of view choose are or titan in the start til you can buy a better us ship the game itself is a bit hard to get in to but after five matches you got the hang of it menu its a bit confusing if you read your way thru you will learn it no problem sound i fly your ship you buy me new hat russian navigation officer the game has characters that talk mid battle taunt the people you destroy give hints and are general fun to listen to one thousand and ten would hire russian officer again overall deign of flyable ships i think you know what most of my playing hours went in to as a game its pretty meh nothing special and lack of features but as ship design goes see you in a while i will study these more march
i regret getting into this i very quickly became well for lack of a better term obsessed i would buy chests whenever they would do the free golden upgrade when you buy a chest over the course of playing this game live spent quite a pretty penny you can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals which is why they would sucker me in there is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall that is where i draw the line between a good free to play game and a bad one this is a bad one with grabby money tactics and for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added there a special limited time only chests to buy to get equipment just for them it honestly just feels so sammy the prices are a lot for what you are getting you do not get a good value at all done let their sales fool you done waste your money on this game they add only benched heroes no actual new ones so in other words you are perpetually swapping out your favourite crusaders for the new cash grab flavor of the event crusaders that are almost always better there are a few positives such as a nice passive trait tree they've added but let me warn you this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact same thing over and over and over you will hardly ever switch up your technique until the new flavor of the event because that one group is effective for anything you do i am a lover of idle games just not this one try tap titans instead it is superior to this game tenfold and they done lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases note if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money and you done mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so done mind the pointless grind because you a rent really working towards anything worth getting even though they do have a passive way to spent idols it just doesn't feel rewarding and if you done mind using the same crusaders because they never add any new heroes they only add heroes to existing benches its hard to explain if you done play the game you'll have to swap out your favourite heroes for the flavor of the event if you done mind any of that you will like this game i on the other hand am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who when all is said and done gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than a indie developers of real games will get and that is just sad from now on i pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap edit i wish that i could find a screenshot i cant help but laugh hysterically the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on a set of three chests costs five they used to be two hundred and ninety nine and get this buy an event jewelled chest bundle today and get a free golden epic card that you wont find anywhere else and there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on holy scam please please done support these developers stop giving them money i beg you not to do it done fall into the trap we as people have to tell developers that this is the wrong way of making money why are these online prices something you will never see or feel in your hand something that is temporary something that is completely ring you most likely will get crap out of your three chests you buy for five because they want you to buy a bunch of them fort two chests for fifty would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent something that is not guaranteed should never be that much money this market int for the customers despite its free nature those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth maybe i am alone in this maybe not only time will tell how this market goes
of exile is a better diabolo two sequel which blizzard wish they would have developed it pablo three is a better action pm and have a stylized cartoony look path of exile is a better action pm and have gritty dark but dated graphics poe a character can be anything and is no one sex a whirl winding archer but is also maiden from my with chain lightnings you done have choices other than cliches and you are the chosen one poe is free and has more players replay valued is still expensive with all the docs and have a casual or even shallow endgame looking for a well polished hack and slash game looking for diabolo two on steroids poe
like every game of this kind when it was awesome the first two days it became quickly a player versus player even tho they have servers exclusively to play this way every game about gathering resources and fighting zombies is ruined one more time due to the players destroying the fun of the game if you like killing people and going solo this is your game on the other hand if you are a player that likes to cooperate with other players explore other places than your re spawn place that it will be your home now gather resources it center this is not your game basically you will just find snipers all around the cities and close to the safe places shooting everything that moves except zombies it is a free game so give it a try but i would not pay a single penny for this
i say other games like data all stars defense of the ancients two and heroes of the storm that live played are all great games and deserve nine hundred and ten and other do alike games that i didst mention are just shadowed by defense of the ancients two but they a rent as action packed a rent as visually polished as smite their ranged attack cant be dodged or blocked their combat field lane jungle are smaller more crowded with in commensurately large model of characters and spells their heroes have eyes in the back of their heads for example i think do as artwork is great the other day i roomed in and found out a man are almost as high as a tree and the landscape is just non existent in so disappointed that i suddenly found out in just not playing an a a game for the action packed joking and vision part go google smite top five plays wasted by ink and one will feel the thrill that other mouse clicking data wont give just remember when one dashes forward in smite hesse will see everything moving backward and will have effective vision field shrinking compared to the more boring three hundred and sixty degree vision field of most other data games one only have part of seven hundred and twenty degrees in smite i said other popular do alike games are great but the comparison is cruel so either six hundred and ten to them and nine hundred and ten to smite or if one cant accept they re six then nine hundred and ten to them and one thousand five hundred and ten to smite deal with it
early access review as a retired adventure quest worlds player just no its just bad just like others say user interface sucks and i just done like the layout and how they cater to a mobile audience it looks bad and it plays bad and apparently its a money grabber sorry artie entertainment but this is
early access review my review of this product ill make this as simple as possible stay away you do not want to buy this i done care what your friends tell you done buy it and get them to refund the english translation of this game is horrible the fact cheaters are allowed to roam around without any kind of meaningful punishment makes playing the game honestly not worth it if you expect good performance think again of hey content was removed from the game at launch of early access and is being slowly trickled back in does that make you want it more the pm is a joke i think i will end my rant here never have faith in a game or a company until you do your research best advice i can give you old no just no look away train wreck in progress
early access review if you like world of tank warships but fancy flying about in space this is for you i quickly tried a couple of games last night and a half hours later i stopped playing it is good fun quite addictive and free to play what more could you ask for would i recommend this game yes yes i would
hands down this game has the best fighting system of all mos one of the problems that i have with other fighter mos is that the combat are too slow in this game however its fast just like how a fighting game should be fast and intense the dungeon can get boring after a while but the player versus player is where this game shines it is where you put what you have learn to use against other people but i done recommend you start piping till you re level three hundred and fifty two thousand and fifteen update there are now some balancing issues some character classes are just outright overpowered the other classes crimson avenge diabolic ester thankfully there is a patch coming that will be nursing them
early access reviewable request three dimensional is a pretty cool massively multiplayer online and i would like to see where it goes given time hopefully the population sticks around long enough for the game to settle into its place on steam i am a fan of the visuals the soft smooth color look really nice in my opinion i would strongly recommend any fans off the other adventure quest games to try adventure quest three dimensional out
so far not too impressed bought the game and cant connect to server at all apparently some north american client has this bug i did everything suggested on their known bugs page and no joy i paid for it and cant use it now i cant give it a good recommendation cant i too bad looked neat on the screenshots update although the support section was kind enough to spend a couple of hours with me the game still wont connect to the server at the end they blamed my internet set up an ordinary router hooked up to a personal computer box but could not tell me why so i had to uninstall a game live never played waste of time and money update after more than a year i changed my personal computer and now it work its a nice open cube building world but in really not crazy about having to be connected all the time to the server even though i single play and having only a limited territory to build stuff
honestly as one of the best gamers in the world i gotta admit you would hardly ever see me playing a game like this ever truth but once you check it out for yourself you'll see that all the bad reviews are nothing but trolls just today i spent five hours in there i was like holy laugh out loud also the way you can build things are so much better then min craft by a thousand i take a step back an see what i created an say damn i made that an now i want people to come check it out honestly its that fun if you like to build things out of the blue an spend lots of hours having fun with your kids or friends this game will take you there not only that all the animals look like they came from a bob marley festival laugh out loud seriously but that makes it even cooler i made my home on top of it all i just started building on top of a tree an then three hours later i had a kingdom laugh out loud but in still working on though so anyway i gave my two cents download the game a see its the way mine craft should have been seriously download give it a try an show you know how to create things out of thin air join us or forever no what its like laugh out loud truth
instant delete after not even ten minuets of game play there are no crosshair and you cant look down the scope of your gun unless you re using a sniper the user interface is terrible i thought people were over exaggerating when they said this games user interface appears as if it was made by a nine year old
early access review at this current moment this game int worth a dime i would strongly suggest you wait till it either goes on sale or eventually goes free to play in a few months optimization int a thing server lag and frame rates are horrible and the english translations are bad i spent most of my six hours of game play in queue to play the game only to get access to a screen that told me the area was too crowded this game has potential to be great just not anytime in the near future
terrible terrible game unfinished cash grab to complete their release on box get out while you can honestly it is saggy in cities when only five people are present for context i have a gtd nine hundred and seventy and intel core i seven four thousand and seven hundred and seventy a processor with unlocked multiplier so that is all i can vouch for but friends i played with who had better graphics cards said it lagged for them as well but again that is only anecdotal the content is super lacking with the deus having no idea how to balance the skills i am looking at you when they patched player versus player but it then took twenty min to kill one mob also after that they add in pcs into arenas which can just one shot you and totally ruins any aspect of player versus player the game is terribly optimized it lacked features that were already out in other regions the supposedly new combat system was pretty much the same as in japan with only minor tweaks that actually hurt the combat the deus seem to have no idea how their game actually works since the balance patches tend to break more things than they fix the game being free to play changes my review slightly in saying that sure go ahead and try even with it being free to play i would not wast my time and thus it still remains a thumbs down for me
early access review awesome way better than pub less lag and you actually have a chance of winning in this game the concept is awesome a group of people are stranded at a ski resort and must kill each other to increases the chance of survival while also escaping a snow ice storm one when the zone reaches its limit a rescue helicopter lands and four people are able to board you must board to win the match i highly recommend this game
i have been playing this game since i have on two accounts sunk around seventeen hundreds hours this used to be an amazing game and at times it still can be but so far it is mired in so so many issues that valve simply refuses to fix solutions that are relatively simple to introduce but never are and the end result is an absolutely horrendous gaming experience they added a levelling system for no purpose other than cosmetic the servers are either barely populated or populated by new players being destroyed by more experienced players because matchmaking just haphazardly shoves in people of all skill levels there no system in place to pit people of an equal or similar skill level in the same server to make for a balanced fun and fair experience which you think they've thought to implement but nah the level system is just there for show it makes for an extremely unsatisfying gaming experience i cannot count how many times live been on a team made up of new players most of them snipers and spies fighting against a team that just curbs toms them before they even know whats going on this is not good its frustrating and its killing the gaming experience for everyone new players done get better and simply get frustrated that they re being shit whipped and stomped left and right by stronger players veteran players stuck on underpowered teams get frustrated at the lack of quality control on servers and some veteran players find the idea of just wrecking house in a minute and leaving to be a very underwhelming and boring gaming experience and no it being casual does not excuse this the majority of people play team fortress two on casual and we deserve more quality control to make sure our gaming experiences are worth having the servers are constantly full of snipers and spies because the game has no universal class limit the game is also extremely unwelcoming to new players the training system fails to cover most of the nuances of the game it has an absurdly high learning curve unless you know it like the back of your hand before going in as i did you re going to have a hard time and the hackers in the past two weeks live encountered about five hackers four times i was kicked off of the server for reporting the hacker and trying to get my team to kick them i done know how but there seriously need to be better ways to combat hackers on the servers because this is unacceptable this game is at this point a rotting shambling corpse fun at times yeah but severely frustrating in a way it has no right to be given how easy the solutions to its myriad of issues would be my gaming experiences recently have been nothing short of frustrating its making me frustrated and i start acting like an a a a a a a a and at that point i think its just not worth it and at the same time i want to enjoy this game because i love it live loved this game even before i played it i was in love with its comedy its world i read the wiki devouring everything i could until the day i could play it live been playing it since two thousand and twelve i done want to give up on it but i have for a period and only recently decided to come back to it but honestly i cant recommend it at this point
early access review a pretty fun game in this review in gonna list the pros and cons of this game pros can be fun with friends and with online matches sometimes a wide variety of legends to choose from its not pay to win ranked is just as fun as casual play but with everything there are some cons cons no matter how you lose or how close you are to winning somebody will always say good game a some legends have to edge over most of being salty just because they lost dash itself but this game is pretty fun and is fairly easy to pick up and play anytime eight thousand five hundred and ten
this game has some amazing graphics but in some places it deeps out but that doesn't matter you will only get the characters if you watched the movies tho the game has got on all the quest people right and the dragons are correct as well its amazing what these people can do and what motivates them
from a game developer and artist standpoint the backlash against the change is ridiculous the biggest issue that elder scrolls from an art direction standpoint has always fell short is their lack of color ever since i can remember they have been focused solely on brown which is the color of poop my friends and while it gave the series a distinct look it is rather boring lets be honest what the art directors have done here is they've introduced more color and interest to the existing brown the brown int gone people embrace the brown cause its still there but now there is a focus on bringing in lavender and blues and deep dark purples i love it the game has a vibrancy it lacked before and i would love for the so universe to start integrating more color into its art done get stuck in the past with nostalgia there is always room for improvement and changing how your players experience the world done listen to this loud vocal minority that is trying to sway you back to their nostalgic roots keep the new look its beautiful
early access review play this game if you have played other artie entertainment games or want an massively multiplayer online on mobile devices you might want to play this game with people cross platform as it is on both is and android i really like aqua three dimensional but i have played adventure quest worlds and other artie entertainment games since two thousand and nine so i might be a little biased it is very simple and there is not a lot of content but it is fun on the go or when listening to a podcast or music
early access review never thought i would be scared of this game a little boy hiding being a screen watching mark per play this i never thought it would be scary when the first jumps are happened it didst scare me but when i went on it started too when i got to that dead space looking part and i turned on the power again i panicked and died also spooky got to stop her crap here have infinite stamina me away thanks tries to run really but in stuck at room seven hundred before you make the rest cant wait a
early access review mode is a fast paced first person shooter developed by war team players choose between two sides in an ongoing conflict earn frags to accumulate points and upgrade your equipment picking new guns from a large arsenal take down enemies up close with the shotgun or hold back and pop head shots with an assortment of sniper rifles fight across visually distinct and congested maps where players are forced into tight corners demanding a quick trigger finger to survive each match is a team deathwatch where the first team to burn through the others lives wins customize your avatar with an assortment of cosmetic items such as masks and banners to distinguish yourself on the battlefield
played this for a little while got tired of the ridiculous micro transaction pay all the dragon timers and the bugs and glitches its been so long since i played this that i couldn't even remember the name let alone why i quit playing all i knew is that i will never play this again if i have any choice in the matter ten wont make that mistake again
those puppets man they freak me out cant get away from the evil puppets then again i might just suck great freebie though done let the childish appearance and graphics fool you this is indeed a horror game and not a bad one at that if i say so myself play it

early access review just place one with trading kills at end prior to that in the same match there was literally four trades you cant have a a king of the hill mode and have trades
although the community can be quite toxic and there are a few balance issues i recommended this if you have friends to play with getting into a voice chat and playing with a good friend is the most fun live had this summer
clearly designed to be a mobile game infested with micro transactions and extremely cluttered user interface limited settings done do any good for this even though its free to play i didst even get into it
in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes benjamin franklin when downloadable content was first introduced to the world people were afraid of it becoming too out of control which it has and while its hard for most free play games to survive in the market these days a game based entirely off of downloadable content is something that you can be sure will die off quickly enter the hunter where the base game is free and features a miles long island for you to explore a shooting range and nothing else the games economy is based in the real world and funded by buying downloadable content packs here you need hunting licenses just to hunt animals or defend yourself from an attacking one and for that you need to spend real world money an exorbitant amount i dare say that means paying real money to hunt virtual animals while the guns themselves do come at a cost that could be understood from a downloadable content perspective it would make better sense to charge fifteen outright and have the first downloadable content be the game the deus have assumed that you re interested and will pay for the privilege to shoot something allow me to make a suggestion to you the reader play the capella dangerous hunts series instead they offer a better and more exciting experience and if you buy the game used a cheaper one how the hunter has managed to remain online this long without offering anything for free is a total mystery the graphics are on par with the last generation of games and hold up really well if you have a computer that a few years old the island atmosphere and landscape are well done and the animal models look good there no guessing as to what you re trying to shoot this is about the only saving grace that this little bit of game has to offer i know in being unfair but since this game is labeled as free play and only features the engine itself the downloadable content being something outside of the initial package means that all you re allowed to do is shoot a couple of guns at the shooting range which makes this whole thing merely a tech demo its in bad taste to say something is free but offer nothing if i wanted to go hunting i know people who will take me along on a trip and it will be a more fulfilling experience cheaper too death and taxes are the only certain things in life so i can safely say that ill die before in taxed by a video game
i let my kid play this game because of how safe it is from online predators and rapists they wont even let people say the words cute or wood that how you know its a safe game a
i will make this short and sweet the game like all games has glitches we all know that i lost some important in game things that i was upset about but the support team helped me out in a very good way so great job to them if you enjoy day a you'll like this much better there is more detail and much more to come done let one bad experience in game ruin your whole experience push it aside and survive like you always will
i love clicker games with an actual goal other than non stop clicking the trophies in game helps move that along and makes it feel like its no repetitive definitely one of my favourites
have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day levelling it up so your friends think you are cool then this is the best game for you first job get a strange either by wasting your money on crating crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on outpost or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to a crate and give him her a scrap for higher recently unbowed strange step two locate a strange level up sever done worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their strange so badly and final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever now all your friends nieces will think next time you kill them wow they got sixteen million eight hundred and fifty our thousand nine hundred and seventy two kills in one day defiantly didst go on a strange level up sever one thousand and ten best game
this used to be a good game but once they got rid of the tiers robots and be the boss or go up against one mode it instantly became crap especially after the introduction of loot boxes and ring
early access review decided to come back to this game after a few months of not playing and after a full night of playing with a soviet soldier the last time i played i was an american soldier i noticed that i had unlocked essentially nothing i went from the initial rank to barely rank two in three hours of play and had unlocked no upgrades remembering that the levelling and unlocks went faster when i first played i checked my american soldier despite having played him for only two hours had many fewer kills and objective captures with him he was rank four with many more ribbons unlocked have i mentioned that you need a great deal more experience with every subsequent rank the game is basically worthless to play without paying at this point i am entirely for supporting free to play games with micro transactions to get things faster but not if they make it entirely worthless to play without paying the game is fun the bullet mechanics are fun the realism aspects are fun the idea is unique but they have butchered the game by crippling any experience points gains
early access review a surprisingly fun and decent card game even if its visual design feels like its aping hearthstone a bit too closely after actually giving it some time live found it to be a good game in its own right i especially enjoy the two tier mana system where you require both a you must be this tall influence cost and a flat mana cost definitely worth checking out if you like these types of games try not to be put off by the tutorial overstaying its welcome a bit as well as getting trounced in it the starter decks are actually really bad but as soon as you throw together even a haphazard one of your own its much better
early access review not a bad game love the graphics and the general idea but no i wouldn't recommend it to anyone just yet the aiming is beyond stupid the movement and actions need tonnes of work but yea the aiming is unplayable
early access review pretty good game so far i love that you get to spawn immediately where you want i love the three classes that you can use in a variety of ways to out play other players so far the only down fall is just the norm for an early access game car wheels are transparent until you get up close the driving however is awkward and seems slow to react those are the only issues i have run across so far i really like how fast you get into games and how well the loot is spread out cant wait to see how this turns out
early access review the game is beautiful but the game is not beginner friendly there no tutorial right after you start the game so if you done notice the tutorial video at the hub and clicked the tutorial button you'll be lost to the void of fractured space i played a game without knowing anything and i done know what to do except to shoot my guns and button mash my skills and capture points but i done know how the whole game works mechanically like how the upgrades works and so on
really cool game please forget the game part and a lot of fun but like others have said the cost to get more guns is simply not worth it to me i do understand all the modelling that went into this and it is pretty extensive but the cost value just is not there for me i do not love the controls but they are workable maybe it is for you
i have two thousand one hundred and seven hours on this game its a fun game i recommend it unless you get mad and salty quick then done play it i like how the developers update the game every week with new content overall this game is a must
fun free game similar to the older sims games have a bunch of dwellers with stats that can level up build bunker rooms and forage in the wasteland for gear and parts fight off raider attacks mutant cockroaches giant rats and try to breed superhuman dwellers while it does have some in game purchases no one of them are required to advance normally in the game they are conveniences like a robot that gathers the resources from your rooms which is one lunchboxes which you can get from quests anyway it center its definitely not pay to win sadly there is no multiplayer aspect i would like to be able to send raiding parties against other players and to fight those raiding parties off
this game is like all simulators at once fishing simulator farming simulator loading screen simulator fps simulator pet abusing simulator would shoot worms out of the sky again
all the things the other negative reviews say about this game are true from crashes and bugs that haven been fixed in years to the absolutely terrible balance of weapons vehicles maps new sounds and addition of do support are proof that you can not polish a turd watch the development streams and see them sitting there drinking beer shows you how seriously they take this game done waste your time grinding things as they will just nerf them in fact done waste your time at all and play something else
early access review its not good if you re over the age of twelve but if you re a child you'll probably get addicted to this and spend all of mommies money on it pros people making it have been making this series for years so it will definitely have a certain love icons its for children and the story writing certainly reflects that constantly spouting memes at you its not unfunny
product received for free this game is sort of good but the pay to progress system is flawed badly and developers are just money hungry while the game itself continues to be broken and the developers done bother fixing the core experience of the game and only add minimal changes every update the game has been getting worse and worse with updates hurting the core game play instead of fixing it on top of that there the awful matchmaking this game is a joke
i am a very old payer of this game ever since wild shadow owned it and there was the old forums this game used to be amazing fun interactive and enjoyable you had to put time into the game to get anywhere and even then you could lose it all in one death regardless of that it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put five hours a week personally i was very addicted to this game during twenty elevens and two thousand and twelve then doomsday came kab am bought realm of the mad god everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things back in the old days you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier twelve item in the wine cellar now just buy realm gold and get tier twelve items in nexus its de up unless you re rich as and done care about money done get this game
in a world where every mob styled game is getting more and more toxic smite is one of the last of its kind that i can enjoy done get me wrong you'll still run into the occasional game with someone who just has to ruin your day but overall live found the community here to be much more welcoming and helpful the game modes are diverse and the massive character roster ninety one atm i think keeps you from getting too bored i feel i should note that the god pack for this game is one hundred worth it as you'll get every character released as they come out which is a huge value at the very least give the game a try
early access review the def are find it up they are ruining everything and now they want to delete the mega bots too i quit playing sure if a play this for the first time or you play it since the rocket launcher it looks fun but for the people that play it since it went online its going the wrong way
this game is cool how to be pro get one hundred and buy tons of keys wait for pm to become tradable buy unusual australia if you done have enough keys add more funds get burning unusual scorching go to farming server and rank up your australia to hales own go to random server and people will praise you such good games rate it nine hundred and eleven a
i only played this game for twenty three minutes which was more than enough time to know that this game is not for me i wont recommend this game but nor will i trash it what i will say however is if you are interested in becoming a pilot one day then this game is probably a good place to start but if you re just looking for the ability to jump in a plane and take off with minimal commands and no real world preflight experience fly around and shoot stuff then this game is not for you either just a bit too much realism for me
early access review no its trash play alliance of valiant arms its free if your computer cant run it then play crossfire its free too anything but this but stay away from combat arms
i usually done play online card games because in my opinion card games like this seem to typically be based more on luck instead of skill which i done like i also typically done play online card games because a decent amount seem to be pay to win cough cough hearthstone cough cough and sadly this game seems to already be going down a pay to win path its not as pay to win however seeing as how getting money for card packs seems to be a lot easier than it is in hearthstone but i am still somewhat disappointed that despite the fact that this game is only about a month old there are technically two docs the dark brotherhood cards and the heroes of sky rim downloadable content the game gave me the aldrin heroes of sky rim deck for free i done know why and i played with it a bit and the heroes of sky rim cards absolutely destroy core cards which kinda upset me i just hope it doesn't get to the point where everyone just uses sky rim cards just to avoid being crushed by other people with sky rim cards because most of the core cards are very good but only against other core cards the only thing i can say i fully enjoyed from this game was the story the story is difficult but not too difficult which i loved and the rewards you get for playing it are amazing overall i have to say i dislike this game but if you are a person who thinks they could get into it i high recommend playing the campaign fully for all the nice bonuses and also done spend your gold on core cards but sky rim card packs with it so you done get crushed
i have about over two thousands hours on this game also add four hundred hours from steam this game is heavily pay to win but it is possible to acquire endgame stats with event items and such i done recommend this game only for the sole reason that new content runs out so quickly and there are gender locked classes
early access review adventure quest three dimensional is quite good it is not wow it is not adventure quest worlds and it doesn't attempt to be either of them what it does do is provide a really fun casual and social massively multiplayer online that is truly cross platform and has a logical gear progression crafting system directly tied to raiding end game raiding in aqua three dimensional is as casual as you would want it to be on an massively multiplayer online that is largely played on phones and tablets you click an pc and are instantly grouped and teleport re to the ongoing raids most rewards after getting an acceptable lvi twenty two gear set are cosmetic in nature and aqua three dimensional allows for much deeper cosmetic customisation options that appear at first glance max level is currently twenty two
the moment i played this game i knew i will be having stiff necks and backaches it is so addictive that you totally forget the time and the tasks you are suppose to do in real life for those of you who loves to base build and play same concept of this game from facebook i am warning you to stay away you'll be so hooked that you even forget to eat and sleep
its pay to win but you can play without it after while i started to visit the inc wales are not fair enemy get just salons and i four red air ships and in not talking about enemy bought them for relax okay but for ranks play not
early access review cant even get a refund with eight hours at this complete mess spend eighty for me and my girl to just ask move around a saggy world not recommended its scum eve said you can refund it steam doesn't accept refunds stay away this is cash grab and a fat one
very well put together game the passive tree is extremely diverse and there more allows for many different types of game play also has a very good free to play model there is no pay to win only aesthetics and bank space can be bought
i loved to play room on my browser for maybe a year but when i saw it on steam while just looking around i had to get it but i have found some flaws compared to the browser version one lags more on steam and two when i go into a realm the coins fame thing is just all messed up by it all merged together on the top right of the mini map but i still really enjoy this game
early access review think this game is currently the closest thing to a magic the gathering adaption on the digital market it combines the simplicity of hearthstone with the depth of magic it contains a lot of play modes several designed ave encounters two procedural ave modes one mimicking draft casual and ranked player versus player and a very well designed draft player versus player mode additionally the reward system is very generous and allows starters to quickly get into the game all in all this game scratches my mtg itch when needed and is not as expensive or shallow as is
early access review played this game as i did not want to pay to play a game like pub i really liked things about this game but there are more things that make this game unplayable the movement system it is so bad and slow that oct dad gives you better controls then this game the spawning in the game is actually so bad that i spawned in a house by itself that was already looted then i play another game where i loot a whole city and not even an axe spawned if you want to update the game you need to launch it first so most of the time for me i forget to see for the updates and update the game so when i want to play the game there is most likely an update so i done bother and play another game instead some games i literally cant find anyone and then other games i get eleven kills as i am somehow in the middle of everything some guns are so bad that you may as well just run away and hope that they done have good aim guns like the car can become obsolete with the other person wearing level three body arm or i once put four mags of five shots into a guy only missing once or twice and after about eighteen shots he die graphics are mediocre but not bad so i cant dislike it i love the style goofy and realistic and mixes the two almost perfectly such as bunny shoes that allow you to jump extremely high or a cigar that gives a damage boost sadly there is not much to like about the game at the moment i want this game to surpass pub but at the moment but many this conflict at the moment i hope some of these problems get fixed may
early access review hate the slow pace of pub and the building in footnote this game is actually fun having an move watch vibe to it with different classes and abilities makes it feel so fresh to the genre this is definitely my new game and in so happy i done have to play footnote anymore
world of guns gun disassembly it is rather good but the tutorial is like a school lesson boring and to interact with the weapon without limits you have to disassemble reassemble and do the challenge to reassemble as fast as possible pros clear explanation of weapon work cool some effect rays overview of weapons cons gun tutorial is like a school lesson disassembly reassembly and challenge must be first done to use weapon without limits i want the challenge optional conclusion is it looks good but i am seeking something that doesn't make me feel like in school
this is my review of this game for starters the game is about world war two where you pick factions in early game the soviets the germans and the allies us each factions has pros and cons for what i observed its a free to play game made by re tomato the game itself is fun wide maps you have opportunity to become a pilot tanker recon or a general itself please done be like those bad generals if you become one like the map has no car bikes it center as a new player of the game you will have an infantry as a starter character of the game if you play us you will have a grand which has good sights in my opinion if you play germany you will have a or fewer fort three which has good precision when not aiming if you play soviets you will have set it is a flexible gun now here comes the new player life as a new player you will be on bronze tier and will be on encounter match this is the best part when you try to understand the game mechanics use this opportunity to understand the game just my advice you'll be versed with bronze skills till silver skills then gold once you've hit the gold tier welcome to the worst part of the game a why is it worst when you re onto gold skill tier a as a new player you will be just running using bicycles using civilian truck and you will be getting camped by recons or infant is with bolt action rifles one hit this part will irritate you the most a the second worst is that tanks with he shells spawn camp you be grateful if one of your teammates are antitank psychos a the third worst part the planes will destroy you if they see you running in the open my advice if they have fighter plane heavy fighter planes and you done have a car go run in the forest area or a place where keeps you hidden with shadows the fourth worst part is that once you are onto capping zone enemies who have heavy set badges will be hard to kill because heavy set badges reduces damage and you are just using your tiny cute stock tier one gun and you will be the one who get killed first because they have better guns than you a the fifth worst part for you you will be versed with insanely good players in some games the matchmaking has skill calibration where you get to your own skill tier and this game has done a why i done recommend this game a the game is way too grind this makes you pay a real dollar into a pixel money sounds stupid but that the reality of this game i prefer to grind in an different massively multiplayer online role playing game game than to grind in this game a reno or the game company does not listen to the communities opinion they just making new bullshit planes new guns they should improvise the maps with weather and the infantry character for me once you get your one hit guns mrs badges cars planes tanks best assault rifles then the game starts to be fun let me tell you if you want to enjoy being tilted triggered or become a masochist then this game is for you my game rating four hundred and ten
so unbalanced if you've previously played the full personal computer version world tanks eras a uni cum pro stat ladder on the other game i can say that this version is like killing puppies if you have any skill
early access review very good game i loved store new space combat system but i was found it stupid just for that subscribe every month i was looking for a game to replace and finally i found it the game is new and in early access and for this the game is simba but its need worked on it i hope it will not stay like this is my english sucks i now
early access review this game is probably worse than cod in its current condition why well consider this pretend you want a paratrooper you have to be level seven to be a paratrooper the average player gets about two hundred experience per skirmish match it takes sixty six thousand experience in total to get to level do you see where this is going this game is a grind it has micro transactions everywhere it is unbalanced its tutorial is crap done play this game just done
early access review very well made fun as well cheaters are treated with serious punishments there are rumours and lies going on about this game having malware live scanned it eight times with avast and haven caught anything or had any trouble
early access review the movement is buggy crouching is buggy the mouse movement is saggy and feels nonresponsive the servers suck the user interface is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time most of it is just lag from my experience the guns are ridiculously overpowered the spawns are broken there are angles that provide immense advantage others players cant shoot you there is no need for iron sights however i had loads of fun playing this game heads hotting from pm away with a pistol is satisfying the game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly free to play i like the point system to buy guns but i think you should be able to gain points over time also more options should be implemented for slider for example the game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as i am concerned overall i thought the game was fun and i could oversee the flaws i recommend it if you want to pass some free time in the future i might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun
early access review awesome game with every update it gets better and better the community is tight knit and there int very much negativity everyone works together its being constantly updated with great updates the look of the armours and weapons gets better and better and its definitely not pay to win they only charge for cosmetic stuff because they have to have a profit or they cant keep developing its not required to buy them at all live been besides artie entertainment since i was a kid and played the original advent request from near the beginning they always deliver the best content they can and this game is a new direction for them and its definitely the right direction
early access review the best streamlined card game live played beating hearthstone hex and magic duels the game is also extremely generous for a free to play entry and gives you tons of ways to earn coins and packs there are so many ways to play campaigns free to enter a short set of campaigns against artificial intelligence opponents that guide you through game mechanics they are a little boring and could use some rework as they've been around for a long time you get rewarded with a basic card pool puzzles free to enter eighty puzzles entered around game mechanics that teach you corner cases and nuances a blast to play and you get rewarded with a good bit of gold gauntlet free to enter most useful gold farming mode you face off seven artificial intelligence opponents and are challenged to beat them all without losing doing so nets you a rank up containing packs and gold until you heart max rank master after master you can still grind gauntlet for the rewards of two silver chests containing gold forge free to enter mix between draft and sealed like hearthstone arena you pick one of three given cards until you end up with a twenty five card deck you face artificial intelligence opponents until you either win seven or lose two if you win seven you rank up just like gauntlet draft a gold to enter draft a card from a booster pack and pass the rest to your neighbour until you have drafted forty card make a deck and then play other players seven wins or three losses three wins and you are ahead seven wins and you get a ton of stuff your win record is tracked and you are ranked from bronze to master casual free to enter constructed play against another player but your win record rank int recorded minimal rewards from winning but great to try out decks or get used to constructed ranked free to enter constructed play against another player and your win record is recorded winning can rank you up from bronze to master gauntlet has better gold minute but trying to hit diamond master in ranked is a challenge of its own eight events variable cost to enter the deus run events usually twelve a month with special deck construction rules i a mono color decks only or play rules draw two cards a turn variables prizes but almost always worth doing if you are starting out play gauntlet until you get to gold or diamond and are having a hard time winning then play forge to master then return to gauntlet then draft until you run out of gold then play gauntlet and ranked and save gold to draft more somewhere in there do some fun puzzles at the end of each month you get rewarded packs for your ranked and draft ranks live only played for a couple of months and i have three fully built tier twelve constructed decks and am working on four my friend started less than a month ago and already has a gold nine drafts not including winnings
early access review fun game when playing with friend interesting robot creation lots of guns but i didst like this zen desk support why august twelve my account was suspended because of my name i sent a ticket asking for explanations i done believe my name is offensive somehow three days later a free am representative i wont say his name in public replied removing my suspension warning he said as i done believe your username is all that offensive his words i playing for a while then stopped until february twenty seventeen when i start playing again only to get suspended again no reason stated this time on twenty third of feb i sent a ticket a week passes i sent another one six july twenty seventeen today and still haven received a reply steam salty august
fun game but if you re looking for own style game play you wont find it here if you go in to this expecting own you wont like it if you go in to it knowing that it is more hack slash you might enjoy it it has elements from do which is cool just done expect the combat to feel anything like dds dice based combat if you want dice rolls go play if its still alive do dungeons and dragons online its based in emerson which in not a fan of but its better than nothing
early access review this game is so amazing and it looks fantastic for early ala pamela anyway if you like things like war thunder or world of tanks and you like space then get this game right now
i didst expect much from mobile version of really enjoyable game but to be honest i never thought it will be this bad and i done mean graphics and stuff here is battles doesn't feel really exciting maps are way too small to enjoy even ten of original personal computer version of world of tanks almost every battle doesn't even last twenty three minutes and its not only low tier thing also having no arty int a good thing but i know it would be too hard to pull on mobile game there is no trace of tactics left i really wanted to play it for much longer but sadly i wont i done really understand the reason why mobile port makes it on steam not the normal version too scared of war thunder having some kind of competition is always great but world of tanks blitz will probably make only people stay away from war gaming games
giving these gas a second chance unfortunately they have not learned from their mistakes still from the past game they made sadly enough nothing has changed at all in this new infestation there is nothing new about it at all same maps same overlay same carelessness sadly enough i kinda knew this would be the cash the only pro i can give is they didst rip people off this time making people pay for the game they still cant own up to promises they have made would not recommend it to anyone non the less waste money on the game as well
early access review very stupid but still entertaining game jerky controls but you will still manage to get kills its oddly accurate with sights the game is just weird it runs good but the engine is just strange
addictive and great to have on in the background int a strain on on the computer neither also the feeling of progressing when being ask or away at work school takes out the grinding dread if i had the money i would put into micro transaction i feel free to play this game is really well done only crit ism i have is a cleaner user interface maybe have another tab for all the sales and other stuff instead of it in the side
leaves suspicious program that that runs on startup after you uninstall it other than that the game is fun at the beginning but quickly gets repetitive since most vehicles are the same and there a really long grind to unlock new things
early access review was hoping for something a little different but this is just another generic on rails massively multiplayer online role playing game the biggest appeal to me is that it doesn't take itself very seriously but in terms of game play its all been done a thousand times before
early access review pure garbage players that are impossible to kill instar spawn in the same spot to get revenge if you kill them total garbage uninstalling this piece of good thing i didst have to pay for it no a servers all rue
edit for a disclaimer this game was available for several months before steam release so my playtime here on steam does not nearly reflect the hundreds of hours i have played this game since closed beta are you looking for the best card game out there look no further i have played three different card games and this is the one i stuck to i have been playing it since closed beta back in summer last year and i still enjoy the game which says a lot this is quite an extensive review it is structured as follows first a comparison to other card games is and gwent then a general pro and contra list and lastly my rating old it is a great game you should give it a try if you like card games or any elder scrolls game what sets this game apart from other card games lets compare it to the most famous one first hearthstone test has a lot less ring so skill and strategic thinking gets rewarded more test is way more generous in terms of acquiring cards the story mode is very rewarding and you get rare epic and legendary cards while levelling up your character to level fifty also arena rewards are better and runs stop at seven wins seven wins can give you up to four card packs you can definitely play this game without spending money on it you just have to invest some time of course game mechanics there is the rune system which draws you a card for every five health you lose if it is a prophecy card you can play it for free during your opponents turn this keeps aggro decks in check and adds interaction aside from that there are two boards lanes in this game which add a lot more complexity to the game play since you cant shut down your opponent by playing one big guard no hero powers while many classes in is are defined by their hero powers test is a lot more flexible in that regard there are ten classes each a combination from two of the five color attributes but you can play mon color as well if you want to and each class has multiple viable archetypes just as an example control mage is a very classic control deck in the color blue and yellow but you can also create a very aggressive action deck in those color and a less aggressive mid range version archer red green has aggro mid range combo and control decks there is a lot of variety the developers are very reactive in terms of car balance if a card becomes too oppressive and a single deck dominates the entire meta they usually react to it very fast when doing so they have shown to have a good hand for it unlike in is many of the nerved cards remain viable after their nerf cards usually done get nerved to death laddering is much more pleasing you cant lose ranks in test which makes the whole experience a lot less frustrating also you have to win less matches to make it to legend rank since there are only twelve ranks and lastly the monthly rank reset is very friendly you get reset to rank five if you finished at least rank four or higher or nine if you finished at least rank eight or higher recently gwent was released which i played for a few weeks during closed beta so let me a dress this as well gwent is a very original game because of its round system and the abundance of a man system which truly sets it apart from other card games this might be refreshing for some players but for me personally it is too far away from traditional card games it feels more like a board game to me because i want interactions between minions in a card game so while test is a much more complex and better game in the style of hearthstone gwent is pretty much its own game in addition to that test has one very huge advantage over gwent there are already mobile versions for the game smartphone versions are not released yet but they are expected to be released early summer so that shouldn't take much longer currently the android tablet app also works on phones its just not optimized for it and menus and stuff are a little tiny on a smartphone screen some general thoughts on whats good and bad aside from the already mentioned things good the meta this has to do with the point about the deus being reactive but even without them intervening the meta is usually very diverse in test first of all you can win with every archetype but aside from that the meta never really gets dominated by one single deck because there are counters to every deck as a result the meta can be very shifty if too many people play a certain deck more people will start to run decks that counter that deck if that counter deck gets too popular there is usually another deck that counters it i personally never experienced such a lively meta in a card game before solo content test offers a solo arena mode in which you can draft a deck and play against the artificial intelligence and you still get some nice rewards for it so you done even have to face human opponents if you done feel like it additionally the story mode in test is the best one i have ever seen in a card game the campaign is a nice start but the recently added expansion dark brotherhood really took it to the next level unlike those boring is adventures that you just had to complete to get new cards there is actually an interesting story to play through and the levels along the way are also created in a very creative way yes lore do you like yes games you will probably recognize a few characters in here i think the majority of cards were inspired by the elder scrolls online but it is definitely not limited to that of and the menu soundtrack is as good as you would expect it from a yes game monthly cards to keep the game fresh the deus add a new monthly card every season some of them are very impact us and shake up the meta others are not anyway it is very nice to see new content that regularly gauntlet mode this new game mode was already announced and should be released very soon the general idea is that there will be certain rules for deck construction you can then enter gauntlet mode with your deck built according to those rules and face other players your run ends after three losses so it is somewhat comparable to arena entrance fee should be the same as well bad now this is purely a matter of taste but some people dislike the look of the game i personally like it and it think it fits the general theme of yes games very well also it looks much more mature and serious than is for example still they could add some new game boards and more songs to the soundtrack since you can get tired of those after almost a year of playing this game rewards for ranked mode you receive one two or three copies of the monthly card depending on your rank each season rank nine five or one which is cool but other than that the rewards are a little lacklustre just a bit of gold and some dust for crafting cards marketing bethesda has not yet pushed this game a lot so the player base is still fairly limited done get me wrong there are more than enough players in this game to always find an opponent in less than a minute but many potential players simply done know about this game yet but it is safe to assume that bethesda will market this game much more as soon as all the mobile versions are released so it is probably just a matter of time my final rating a solid nine hundred and ten the game int perfect but there int much to improve the ranked rewards bother me a little and they could add some stuff to make the game look more interesting and diverse but aside from that it honestly is the best card game i have ever played and it is free to play so go ahead and try it yourself if you haven already enjoy
the game itself is nice but you need to put a lot of money to have content in only playing it at the moment because they offered me a coupon with some rep in game currency if you want other games like this i suggest race series project cars asset to cora factor games occur or grid auto sport
graphic is not exceptional but the game is quite addictive and there are a lot of good ideas behind a great improvement to standard idle game where you do not have to think to much there are only two catastrophic problems for macintosh users one game reset to level one each time you restart game freeze every time you change window problems with the chat were also reported as it is it cannot be considered in beta testing but definitely still in alpha phase as soon as these issues are resolved the game could become really good to
if these survival games are any indication to the hope of humanity if an apocalypse comes we are all screwed if you manage to load up the game and get in game despite the freeze lag problems most likely within your first is minutes some guy is going to kill you for no reason the open world is nice not too hard to find items eventually but the game is still full up hackers many which it claims to be banning that the fun of it get taken out of it you try to hide from someone clearly out of view not moving yet they run straight at you as if they see you and then running doesn't matter every shot they shoot hits you would be a fun game if people didst turn out to be straight holes and full of hackers
this game was the single most boring thing i have ever played in my entire life my favourite part was how i could not shoot any of the animals i found because i haunt paid for the game when i did find a deer i could shoot two hours into play i shot it it died and i done really know what i was expected to feel joy accomplishment because at the end of the day all i felt was older and more tired
i liked how this game made you feel like a soldier like you really do feel like you are on another planet and destroying stuff with all your friends and buddies it is a game that really makes me feel like in important and like i have a goal to do something bigger than just the usual day to day struggle of life i recommend it to anyone with heart anyone who will take the time to appreciate the small things anyone who int a gigantic loser
bad admins banning people without care to explain and showing what the reasons only mentions their rules that they can banning anyone with or without reasons as long as they think that person is too rich in game
early access review gave this game a chance and stuck it out through all the bugs class imbalances and all the little annoying things i watched it go from a players to two thousand players in a month after waiting for changes that never happened me and others i know had to call it quits before wasting even more time in my last few days of playing the game i found myself mostly gathering for gold with the occasional dungeon party that want my idea of a fun endgame pros acting cons be wiz purposely left out content that in other versions of the game class imbalance combat feels clunky cant trade lots of bug easy to get stuck on terrain bad translations cant choose your own selling price in the auction house auction house pc is only in a select few places in the world travelling somewhere takes forever dungeon finder takes lumens to us endgame dungeon bosses drop gear at a very low chance making running dungeons feel not worth i queue for battle grounds is glitchy and takes forever to get in i personally done like the mount and pet stamina system lumens marketplace doesn't have any thing worthwhile to buy same four costumes since the start of the game
early access review a few years ago it was a gaming title to behold after months of progressively worse updates and game play changes this is officially one of the worst games i have ever played i am officially pleased with one recent change involving the game its now removed from my games library never again
a particularly bad offender in respects to the person with better cards will win so you better grind but you have to grind against people with better decks or give us money in order to get the resources to build a better deck and yes i am aware that the arena exists so you could grind there but in order to get the dark brotherhood and madhouse cards you need four thousand five hundred gold in chunks of at least one thousand so if you grind in the arena the rate at which you'll accumulate the gold for those cards will be hampered so much that you wont be getting any of them for a very long time
with over five hundred and thirty nine hours and counting this game is alright my only complaint is the russian tanks planes the russian vehicles are way to over powered and have been for a while my tiger a took a direct hit to the current and i was knocked out in one shot even the developers have taken notice but refuse to do anything because they are ashamed of russian technology back then
of planet side two how glorious you are massive two thousand player servers spread across three different continents and across three warring factions of glory be being a free to play game free to play you done have a reason to at least not try the game out that is if your computer can handle it previously the game was extremely poorly optimized for and cups and that has recently changed where i was once getting twelve frames in large bio dome fights in now giving it fort five bonus points now the game is an infantry vehicular combat game the three factions fight over different facilities across each continent that provide different passive boosts to weapon and item costs and resource gains every time you purchase a grenade for your soldier you use infantry resources same goes with a personal me kits and the highly useful and bad ass max suits vehicles take the appropriate resources as well and depending upon what you attach to it cost more now the three factions are all similar yet very different both aesthetically and performance wise the new conglomerate have slower firing more powerful older type weapons while the van sovereignty have laser weapons with perfect accuracy no bullet drop but dow low damage each faction has a shared few vehicles and their own fighter plane heavy tank and different weapons for each shared vehicle as well now planet side two is a free play title but done let that scare you away most games have a pay town model to be more precise were as long as you just dump money into the game you will have much improved gear over others and this is why most free to play games fail but not playstation two the only thing real money is good for in playstation two is purchasing a subscription which gives you an allowance of five hundred so station cash per month and an experience points and cert bonus certs are what is used to unlock weapons and attachments while so is used to purchase weapons skipping the warning of certs as well as customization options such as camps helmets and emblems on your soldier and vehicles you can not buy certs outright which is where the balancing is each weapon can be modified heavily with weapon attachments which alter their performance drastically from a red dot sights to a sniper rifle scopes or silencers or weapon grips it all depends these are purchased using certs you earn one cert per one thousands experience points in game while the weapon may be bought with so and skip the one thousands cert price point the attachments must be earned through play i know this review is all over the place but if you like fps on a massive scale skip that battlefield four sixty our player nonsense and jump right not an amazing free game planet side two may
the worst game development group ever never listen to the community and never fix things filled with hackers which the deus have no idea of how to deal with basic a good game that got spoiled by the deus
early access review worst magic the gathering clone i have ever played minimum deck size is seventy five cards which makes the ratio of getting your best cards smaller than in other cogs mana flood seems to be worse in this game than others i have played i enjoy the influence mechanic but other than that you can find in other games just about anything you find in this one play infinity wars play hex play mtg play anything but this waste of time
after logging almost nine hundred hours into this game and being a willing white whale to it as well it breaks my heart to say that i can no longer to recommend this game when i first started this game the grinding was still fairly large but could be bypassed by paying for their premium currency did this giving you an advantage yes and no yes because you were able to get the best gear and no because you still had to learn how to play the game at this time i had the most fun with this game because i didst have a lot of time to grind everything out then the deus came out with an update that made it so you had to go and grind everything or pay a lot of money to upgrade the one ribbon you needed to get the latest and greatest thing i can understand why they did this but as someone who loved the game but hated the grinding this frustrated me a lot i decided a while back to take a break from this game and just see if the game would add more content that would make the grinding much more bearable after about two years i get into the game to see that they added med kid with a new ribbon to grind to get better things a couple new plane for each faction some newer pistols for each faction and one new map to me this doesn't really justify the grinding needed in this game to get some more of the better weapons that said even the starting rifle can be upgraded to make it top tier with grinding it old once was a great game till lack of new content and the endless grinding got old
i obviously have enjoyed this game for some time it is the most realistic hunting game on the market real hunters will have a true advantage over gamers that done hunt the graphics and scene is are beautiful thirty even different species and eleven reserves to hunt and the deus are always working on more weekly updates the subscription is very cheap around three dollars a month its relaxing and exciting at times tons of competitions and missions to earn in game money and trophies for free players there are three species you can always hunt whitetail pheasants and european rabbits and they rotate two other species every week for you to hunt for free you can also join multiplayer games to hunt with your buddies its de finely worth checking out if you would like info on how i pay for my items and membership without spending my own money please check my profile
this game is amazing i agree the graphics could be better but overall the story characters and the dragons are great i recommended this game for my sibling and she loved it one thousand and ten
a boring clone of clicker heroes with samey art of anime monster girls which include but are not limited to multiple varieties of girl dressed as cat girl dressed as dog girl dressed as bird and girl dressed as girl progression is slow and cumbersome the abilities done have keyboard shortcuts and the sound design is generic also nearly half the options are micro transaction whoring and the games artists patron if you need to look at anime a go on the internet if you want to play a clicker game go play something else
if you have a rift cd you need to try this sim out one of the best virtual reality experiences to date with a hot as and rudder controls its out of this world be sure to set the display settings in the games display options to the virtual reality preset otherwise you may experience some frame stuttering issues when you move your head around not only is the virtual reality experience great but the simulation physics and flight feel great haven seen a flight sim this good since falcon forty or fax may
great for learning but after unlocking the sixth or something gun you have to grind a lot to reach the next one so it gets in the way if your goal is to learn something new you re stuck there spamming the same guns then after all that grind you get a new gun learn all the parts like in a few minutes and back to grinding
i am an original planet side player and played fanatically three years after playstation two released and i finally have a computer that could run it so i just had to give it a try i miss some of the old mechanics but the heart of the game is there i even bought a three month daybreak pass for the genes and to support the game and have found it well worth it very enjoyable with some great firefights to be had even on off hours i had a real tough time for my first few hours but after you get last the learning curve there is a ton of fun to be had here i haven even fired up my mic yet just killing van and the red menace and enjoying the zero give it a shot you wont regret it
early access review walk down corridor walk through door walk through room find door walk down hall way cardboard cut out pops and says hello walk through next door find note on table and run for your life run run run run run run run run run run am a in cardboard cut out in scared me whf awesome fun creepy funny game done drink the wine
it is a good game but the steering is difficult and there is not much customisation towards the start of the game like more than one car and one track they should take a leaf out of for a motor sports book
early access review this game is amazing it loads fast and the mechanics are amazing if they would add skins for weapons and add characters and other a dons it would even be more amazing
this game may seem cute adorable and innocent at first with the cute scary pops outs every now and again i was glad to see a spooky scary skeleton but things got a little dark when there was notes laying around and a demon like ghost following you where ever you go until a certain point that is not to mention that there are some dead ends and tons of spooks if you re into horror running away types you might like this despite it being looking like it was made for kids when it want id say one thousand one hundred and twelve maybe but all in all i enjoy it its not alone in the dark or any other scary horror like that its as the title says spooky house of jump scares and of boy in pretty spooked and in not joking this game actually gave me goosebumps May
tough learning curve but worth learning no other game can match the scale of these first person shooter battles team play and tactics are very important in this game millions of ways to play and very open world as long as you done get lit by the enemy community is very good and a good source of knowledge if you are new youtube channels recommended atlas for tactics rel for reviews tips it center not pay to win as weapons are mostly side grades and the default weapons are very competitive already overall a very fun game if you can get into the right fights find your play style find your right outfit and learn a bit about the game
this is one of those games that either wears off renee really fast or draws you so far in you cant stand to be away from your vault for too long for me it wore off just after the first week there is terrible balance in this game very unforgiving and seldom rewarding when you ask for assistance via the forums everyone tells you the same thing done get more than fort nine dwellers until each and every dweller has a freaking legendary weapon and outfit basically done play the game best thing you can do is build about six rooms get a mister handy put a diner power plant and water treatment on the same floor and simply never play again rad scorpions will stop your game solid and whats worse if to take too long to defeat one as soon as you do kill it another one spawns right after the other draining power faster than mole rats draining health quickly canada and dealing radiation damage whats the official solution done exceed fort nine dwellers want to rush the med bay at twenty five chance after a sequence of repeated rad scorpion attacks too bad that twenty five is all it took and it failed the punishment a rad scorpion attack have fun i recommend the game to try but i done recommend playing past the first week the game runs on real time meaning everything matters because you have to wait real time for things to happen and it takes less than five seconds for all that work and progress to drop dead everything you know about fallout the arm or the weapons you can forget about all that because only special applies if you so much as stand in a room with an enemy in the room on the other end of the room you will steadily lose health and or gain radiation damage expand your vault but do not progress kinda an oxymoron int it because morons are the ones who programmed this asinine combat system while a quirky little human ant farm it has much work to be done before it is polished and becomes actually fun sadly the forum community finds their illogical solutions more reasonable than admitting the fact that the game might just be flawed and needs a few patches if only just better in game instruction ill keep playing it for a few minutes a day ill give it that much of a chance but so far after ignorantly evicting about seven perfectly useful dwellers in hope of curbing the rad scorpion madness i had a mole rat attack that spread faster than i could assign dwellers to the room the result was half the vault dying as the mole rats were in every single room except the overseers office and i couldn't possibly keep tabs on every single dweller happiness went from ninety six to eighty two in less than a moment not to mention the dwellers were still recovering from the previous two consecutive rad scorpion attacks in which the med bay was drained of all its st impacts fighting that one christ the game needs work some game mechanics need some changes no one gives a mol rats about my opinion though in pretty sure on bethesda perspective as long as they get people buying their glorious quantum and lunchboxes they probably wont do anything about the game balance play by our rules wuss we are right and you are wrong
after you stay half a hour to realize how to enter in a game you will stay in a very long loading screen with an idiot music you spawn already killed and you need to wait very long to re spawn
product received for free early access review are you kidding me random drops instead of just being able to buy everything with in game currency this is beyond stupid how can the deus give this small amount of crap about their community does anyone know a game similar to this one but with good deus
nine hundred and ten would suggest this game to any and all types of gamers data two is the perfect game what with its disgusting fan base community and its highly addictive nature that will ruin your life if you enjoy pushing aside your responsibilities and loved ones in order to achieve a six hour meth binge this is the game for you given nine due to the lack of pictures of gabon in game
early access review good game its fun basically a mob with space ships it does however appear to suffer from terrible performance for a lot of users and i personally had an incredibly saggy and jittery experience its definitely worth playing but it would be a lot better without the lag i may try to do a reinstall mess with settings it center to see if that helps with the lag later on May
in my opinion this is one of the best multiplayer shooters available today there is something for everyone whether it be tank driving air battles support wether as medic or engineer platoon squad leader or just walking around shooting people no matter what you do you will fall in love with this game and its community and every time you boot the game up and join a platoon you will remember why download and play it now you will not regret it unless you are extremely impatient and cannot tolerate death

i love this game i play this game two years since version one hundred on android spend time for collecting gems and spend money for open the box but your choice to banned or card and a card from structure box is too crazy so now i think must stop playing this game i cant follow your mind good job kong sorry i must say this game only for rich player new box new banned history for my bad english
early access review do not waste your time or money the resource mechanic absolutely ruins an otherwise fantastic game the art style is amazing the lore is amazing the impact each of the cards have and the balance between archetypes is amazing none of that matters if you cant actually play the game and that exactly what happens in the majority of games you either draw way too many resource cards but no units to spend them on or no resources at all the amount of games where a eleven minion has slowly whittled down me the opponent is absurd there are plenty of other games out there with cool art and lore that actually let you play them
this game runs like and seems like it would be full of annoying ten year old i say seems because i cant load into the frigging world and it crashed constantly do not get this game
early access review what are you waiting for two more days remain to get this game for free its in alpha and has some bugs but has been pretty fun you haven played a real battle royal game till you get panned by someone wearing bunny slippers and winged kneepad of speed
its yugo if you like the real thing then you'll like this duel links uses the speed dual format so matches go much faster then your average duel you gets tons of free stuff when you first start so pick your favourite deck and make it easily
early access review valhalla is a rather fun and interesting game to play with your friends not so much fun playing online alone it is almost identical to super smash bros and the feeling is really great from what i have played it is a lot of fun to just mess around with friends in a custom game
early access review started playing this game no twenty sixteen of august with one of my friends at first i was searching for min craft but looking at the price my friends would probably not want to invest the money on min craft which left me buying the game and play alone is not fun at all then i keep searching and discover creatives which is what free and i suggested it to my friends and we started playing we enjoy a lot of this game especially during exploration of ore for crafting purpose and fighting monster the feel of around my friend is really good in this game caused we can interact together the graphics though was great either what i really feel bad about this game is only when i reach the bottom level of the game it self and got nothing to explore anymore it will make the game not really enjoyable since basically we had seen everything in this game when we go to other caves it will still be the same item again which is getting boring after we had found the deepest thing in this game will keep playing this game again with my friends if there are any update regarding more exploration not another block update since i done craft that much i prefer exploration seeing things that are new which can lead me and my friends keep playing overall the game is so good before you reach the deepest part of the layer i recommended playing this August
refreshing new take on the infestation title or so i thought pros new items weapons and attachments skins galore vehicles market new game modes and maps cons anti cheat dost work worth a damn bans cheat users after the fact meaning they will always cheat kill some players then get banned always have players clipping through walls and floors to kill you with esp precision complete bull for player versus player search google thousands of results for infestation the new cheats youtube over five hundred recent videos of hacks in game deus defend this game and say there is no cheaters only very good players yeah of then meanwhile all the legit players are quoting this game really wanted to like this game but without fair player versus player its just boring
free to pay as much as id like to love this game because i love the movies i just cant the game falls very short in my opinion for two main reasons the first is that at times the controls can be frustratingly cumbersome especially during flight sometimes it takes a while to register a turn or boost but maybe this is just due to timing the second is that you re bombarded with advertisements for membership additional perks and boosts which in really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself i done mind a bit of advertising these however are in your face particularly on the loading screens which i like to contain useful in game information such as hints or history there nothing wrong with micro purchasing in a game its down to how well its presented that counts and unfortunately it seems that a lot of the items or areas are unlock able only if you pay thereby limiting the actual amount of freedom you do get to explore while you can explore freely to an extent its pretty linear in that you must follow the path set out for you and play through before you can really move onto the next one good thing about the game is that you can choose between solo and multiplayer but after awhile it becomes samey and i quickly lost interest sad because it has the potential to be a great game

early access review broken want to play a game it will get you in one but it will break straight away and will send you back to deployment screen and not allow you to do anything furthermore the grinding to get anywhere is unreal
what can be said about this game that hast already been said nothing really but here goes nothing its kinda a diabolo two clone but does have its own original game style is it fun hells yes is it worthy schwinn is it worth it us lets see free i would say yes if you are an arg fan than jump on the wagon train and ride this puppy cut your probably not gonna find a better free game of this genre
this game is a pay to win game or better know as pay to win and i say this because if you done buy like a rank or anything like that you have to spend countless hours more then if you pay
solo arena is really unbalanced some games are guaranteed losses if they get to start with a creature and its purple or better you lose if they have a weenie deck and one of the lane converts animals you lose if the final boss has a dog turn starter and you done have the mana ring you lose very frustrating to draft a good deck and lose
you can get cheated out of your purchases i bought gold and paid four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and it never showed up in my game and they claim everything is of on their end and referred me to a third party game developer which got me nowhere
a great fighting game that can even run on a low spec personal computer what kills is that its almost a pay two win game its a great game to play i also played grand chase too which is about seventy five percent similar to this dragon nest is also another game you could try a great game to kill time but still looks pay two win and also the items are kinda limited time
there used to be a game called data two then a new patch seven hundred came out and turned it into a copy of league of legends that patch changed almost every aspect of the game i liked it the way it was
warning reader discretion is advised caution this review has slight violence that others may find offensive i myself do not condone self arm of my experience absolutely disappointing i got that giant battlefield i was wanting wide open spaces and fresh air until some guy shoots you from half a mile away that is let me tell you something you have absolutely no idea what helplessness is until you've entered the wrong zone with someone who lives a lightyear away seriously i pull out a rocket launcher when i was heavy infantry and shoot the guy in the face seems normal all is cool yeah nah he whips out a knife and stabs me while i shoot him in the face that rocket he ate it and those bullets i unloaded into the guy never left my barrel i suppose you think that you be able to dominate and be stealthy in this game was an infiltrator at the time while all of the other infantry risk their lives for a point no not really there always that one guy you should know him no how about a brief reminder hes that one guy who is always looking for you no matter where you are he will find you and murder you because one of his friends told him that you done like his new axe body spray and hes super self conscious would love to tell you the story of all my failures but nobody is gonna wanna read that sci doodle so heres a summary you got good internet play if not please find a garbage can proceed to stab yourself not too much just enough to bleed out in a good few minutes and throw yourself in the trash just think of all the good you be doing for example i would be gotten to experience the game to its fullest extent with friends along with all those other people you scared away because of your internets absurd temper a him a veteran player with five hundred hours and never experienced this problem a i envy you you little so next questions was it possible that it was your side a if it was me id stop playing and find something better to do in currently paying for the best internet i can get is it possible that you just such blah lambda laden lala i cant hear you what are the specs on your computer a good duff i can run the game at ultra who that guy a you re joking right we just went over this a you've only got an hour and a half into the game why judge it so harshly a games good but you might want to have a couple friends people i met were awful why do you recommend the game despite you not liking it a lets get real this game is good if you had not played it yet i suggest you try it when you have the chance i may not play it for a while a long while but when i get time ill definitely come back for more when live got some friends gathered a what would you rate this ten a seven hundred and ten opinion may vary through further pamela please if you are reading this and have yet to play this game get some friends your first impression will be way better that way and tell joel to stop downloading his female chests since in not allowed you use profanity you'll have to deal with chest and if you caught this reference kudos to you i may not answer review me a very bad friend and some random guy who said he didst want credit for the top question may
early access review arguably one of the best cogs on steam combines the visual aesthetic is similar to hearthstone but the game plays a lot more like magic the gathering i have well over two hundred hours on this game and i done see myself stopping anytime soon eternal has a balanced meta and card mechanics that could not be implemented in a typical trading card game this game truly is refined and constantly evolving highly recommend this game
i used to play this game a lot back in twenty sixteen when it was in early access but ever since the game officially launched it seems to lag more but the over all game is great the sound design is good the graphics are impressive for its style but the game is at its best when you are surviving along side your friends and trying to go out gray resources and build a base to defend yourself the game is a true masterpiece in its survival elements which you'll have tones of fun with as i love survival games like this where you have to gray resources and plan when you want to go on a supply run and if you go alone you an have your friend working on your base because i was with my friend and we made a beach house and connect it to are base in a mine so i would say give the game a try and if you done like it that fine and if you do like it that fine too its all your opinion
this new yugo game with new rules new shit cards sucks but it is still better than heart stones i still like yugo with eight thousands he and five cards fields some cards are meant to played when there are five space on the field and some cards are only useable when you start the game with he
early access review enjoyable collectible card game with some flaws borrows user interface visual design and quality of life features from hearthstone while moving the design space forward in satisfying ways card combinations can be very powerful allowing for more interesting deck building options single player options are interesting but lacking long term replay ability opting instead to drive players to player versus player battles while this makes sense when considering the genre there is unlined opportunity that eternal seems primed to exploit upcoming expansions look ready to offer more single player options suffers from resource randomness the big challenge in eternal is the very poor system governing resource draw resource cards are included and then drawn from your deck like magic hex it center and there seems to be something wrong with eternal deck randomization system it is common to encounter resource glut sometimes drawing nothing but resource cards during a single match while a hand redraw guarantees two resource cards resource drought is also common while i understand the wish of the design team to stay true to their magic roots the competitive digital collectible card game space demands design systems that optimize the player experience and while hearthstone steady resource gain system seems to take some of the life out of the collectible card game experience it balances the competitive experience in a critical way imagine for example if eternal had a steady resource gain mechanic with a random color draw that could determine the type of the resource drawn this random draw could still be based on a number of resources included during deck building while helping mitigate the game breaking randomness of resource draw while the resource issue is enough to keep me from spending a ton of money on eternal i have enjoyed the rest of the game if you re looking for a game with a strong mtg feel but with a mostly modern design approach to the digital collectible card game genre i think eternal is a good choice
early access review this game makes me think of super smash bros and in really enjoying it so far and i will continue to play and will look forward to new legends maps and updates
early access review developers pushing stuff that could've been designed by their little cousin because they can sell a mini campaign with a buy in super pushed creature removable mostly by its own color makes the ladder which is to a mind numbingly boring experience since almost everyone and their dog wanting to climb plays that card either because its good or because the same color are needed to remove it cant wait till someone wants to make money by making a good card game rather than make money with dubious buy this power creep here guise type deals shame because there obviously talent here but design decisions tell me all i need to know what matters int where you are its which direction you re going and this int going in any good direction got banned and lost all account access after posting this review laugh out loud the upside is it got me in the mood to try faerie which turned out to be a straight up a better card game
developers should advertise a little better the payt play mechanics involved what looks to be a promising time consumer with us mechanics turns out to be a rather frustrating and unclear experience that ended up putting me off a big and immediately evident downfall is that you cant host a game with your friends without paying for the privilege so you have to join an existing server on which you'll find you are not able to actually shoot at anything due to the payt play hunting license mechanic in by no means against payt play but done lie to me this shouldn't really be advertised as free to play in its entirety some single player hunting enthusiasts may get some enjoyment out of it but for multiplayer with your mates unless you re looking to sink some cash into it this int free to play mAy
early access review love this game the fact that you keep every card you use in draft and forge makes it worth buying into them whether with gold or real cash it is so easy to earn gold in this game in already halfway to earning enough to buy jerks bounty without ever putting a cent into the game itself
its quite clear that the only branch given any love whatsoever is the soviet branch the battle rating system which is used to balance the matchmaking is heavily biased towards soviet medium tank drivers this system also completely breaks heavy tanks where they are placed in battles full of weapons that can easily penetrate their heavy arm or thus defeating the purpose of a heavy tank if you are looking for an historically accurate world war two vehicle warfare simulator this is not it tanks and aircraft particularly heavy tanks will never face in an online battle what they actually faced during the era in which they were used
the game as it is is pretty good i would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher development is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent events are just tedious mind numbing grinding a recent event required you to do over one hundred games within three days to get a tank or plane or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for forty bucks ground forces tanks is even more grinding than air forces it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation or you could just go ahead and buy experience with real money the ground forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank for example you have to research fire extinguishers that can take a decent amount of games especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank while you watch being unable to do anything or well you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money you have to train your crew not so bad for planes since you have only one crew member for most fighters but in tanks you have up to six crew members in tanks you have to train every single one of them individually or you spend some bucks on them air re battles are unchanged since the game came out they are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks you often come out with just as much so in game currency to buy stuff as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs their balancing methods are just bad instead of incrementally nursing or buffing a tank every other week they will completely nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank or plane for that matter for months again naval forces have been in closed access meaning you have to pay to play them for over a year now in the steam screenshots you can see boats there are no boats in the game they only have been in the game for one day april fool the list goes on that just what i have in my mind right now you can take a look at more posts like these war thunder general mantra thunder about repair costs thunder about their horrible prewar thunder about repair costs ii aprIl
if you done mind paying up to instantly unlock everything this game is fine however when they match brand new players with four towers to select and half the upgrades locked out against people who can fully upgrade with all the towers at their disposal its just not fun time and patience is finite so i will not be grinding through a metric ton of unbalanced match ups and i cant see blowing money on this kind of garbage set up so uninstalled
early access review eternal is a fun game except for one thing and its a big one they need to fix how many or how few power cards are drawn in a row during a game winning or loosing a game because all you received were power cards or no power cards is not only not fun but there is no strategy involved you get to watch the other player kill you or you get to kill them without much push back i haven played a day yet where i won or lost due to this issue the game is really fun but extremely frustrating when this occurs i have repeatedly left feedback without any responses i cannot recommend this game for that reason there are too many other games that are more fun to play these days
basic mechanics similar with hearthstone but some differences to like board is split from mid to forty four max eight minion for each player left lane is field lane right lane is shadow lane right lane is completely basic but shadow lane gives stealth for one turn stealth minions cant be targeted by enemy minions but can be targeted by actions supports battle cry and death rattle effects and unlike hearthstone when you summon a battle cry minion with another way than playing like evolve you can use battle cry game is pay to win of course but with daily quests and monthly claim rewards its easy to make money game done have very much expansions yet but slowly more coming game got story modes three part each one costs one thousands gold are pretty fun to play i highly recommend the game if you like this kind of card games
so currently i only have around twenty four hours and i am in the third out of four acts this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind path of exile is fantastic every steam owner should at one point or another try this game however it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around seven hours to get there for me at least this game is basically the paladins to diabolo personally i think these games are about equal with diabolo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points art style in act one in sorry but this game just looked like garbage i personally couldn't stand looking at my character going through uninspired nasty depressing backgrounds thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act three being the nicest looking act thus far diabolo i think should be a key mark for this just compare any game play from diabolo with that of path of exile dialog backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle and spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play poe is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at progression of this is purely opinion based but i will try to be as objective as possible diabolo takes an approach that is very standard in the role playing game industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there in this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds in poe it takes an approach that is being rapidly popularized with games such as albion online that being skills are merely items that you equip this system allows for much more creativity but can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confusion with new players in my personal opinion i think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion however poe wins in the customization department purely because of the passive skill tree holy crap this skill tree no barriers locked behind class walls all classes can have any passive that is so refreshing rarely ever do i see games do this and i still have no idea why pamela this is an action role playing game meaning prepare yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat not really much to say other then that its very fast paced overall this is a must play i intend to progress farther and play for engage content
early access review used to play this game a lot because it was fun it was fun grinding games to get myself a set of the best arm or and watch as all of my bots slowly turn black the color of the highest tier arm or back then they removed the tiers and all my grinding went to waste i am okay with that because the arm or was cheap and i could buy literally millions of them after every match because i was using a megabit they then removed megabits i was sad but the game was still fun to play there were things to build and things to look forward to my efforts in game was reflected in my rewards after every match now the rewards are no longer really based on skill its all ring now you could do the best in the entire match and get worse rewards than the player on the bottom of the scoreboard you done get money anymore so you have to rely on ring to get the item you want instead of just saving up old rewards in game are based on ring instead of an harmony system the rates are worse than a japanese waif phone game your efforts in game no longer match your reward
i am primarily a laugh out loud player but lately i have been interested in other mobs i took a look at data two and smite and smite is a very interesting game right away you notice a huge difference between it and other mobs being the over the shoulder perspective i love this because it allows people to sneak up on enemies for banks the game is easy to run like other mobs so that int a concern in not a big fan of the over equalization in this game but its tolerable i very much recommend this game to casual and more competitive gamers just because of how easy to run and deep it is if you like classic mobs but a rent the biggest fan of the birds eye view this is perfect for you i think you should try it out if you a rent sure its free so you have nothing to lose edit reading other reviews ignore the people complaining about the community if you want to play an online game they all have communities if you really cant stand the community play with your friends do normal games and add the decent people to play with them again
i love this game i play it with some of my family members and they share the same views its a family friendly game simple to the point where almost every one can pick it up and with some harder to master aspects such as me spending twenty minutes trying to find the teleport in the crafting menu then screening when i noticed the search bar dunno may that just me but my point is almost any one can pick it up and its fun for most sadly with any of these types of games there a limit to how much fun you can have for an avid gamer like myself i spend most days not getting up from the personal computer and if i do it can only mean one of three things in being screened at to eat something in going to watch doctor who or in late for school as all ways anyways i recommend to play this game with friends and family alike and most of all have fun and note rating friends dose not go down well
never winter is massively multiplayer online role playing game massively multiplayer online role playing game its a free to play game which means you done have to buy the game to play it but there is the option to buy game packs which give you certain in game items that make the game easier to play you can also buy items in the game with real money to obtain otherwise unobtainable items although you can spend real money you done have to you can level your characters up in the game and find some special items just by playing for free the in game graphics are obviously dependant on your graphics card but on my gtd the graphics are very smooth and detailed one issue i do have with the game is it can be saggy when there are a lot of players on one map my internet connection is fibre at my and i never get any less than lbs down and lbs up so the lag is certainly not my connection cryptic just done have enough server space speed to cope at times i would certainly recommend this game if you like role playing games and to be able to play for free if you want to is fantastic in my opinion
this is a mobile game port over to personal computer so as expected its a waiting simulator with some time saving purchase options its like farm villa from facebook meets fallout interesting little time wasting game that being said its well done well coded and mildly entertaining go into this game knowing its a waste of time and pretty basic and you'll probably enjoy it free personal computer game for a mobile game
early access review one of the best free to play shooters out there not pay to win at all anyone who says that is completely idiot you can get any weapon with in game currency there a rent any super overpowered weapons each works differently got different spray pattern you just need to learn how to control it battle match is my favourite mode but it should have more maps there are only three available for now it looks decent enough although it could use some optimization in that one hundred and twenty hours live never met any cheaters still i can read loads of to reviews about how the game is crowded by them
generic clicker game that adds a little more flavor and pleasing aesthetics to the mix like most clicker games you have plenty of ways to increase your coins click and idle impassive gains in this the difficulty curve is more pleasing because you start with a set of spells to jump start your game you gain monster coins on a chance per click basis and plenty of paths for upgrading your coin gains pros free to play you can put money into the game but from what i gather you wont want to until higher tier buildings much later on aesthetically pleasing clicker open well enough so you can see your growth plenty of tasks that keep progression interesting cons no sounds no music only the sound of my mouse clicking frantically long gaps of waiting time between progression at the end of the day its just another clicker gamer one of the better clicker games out there right now limo its not just a screen to click on yes it is but you can see progression and get your tasks done in a fairly reasonable amount of time like most clicker games just have a lot of patience and done expect too much
early access review well it was pretty good when i started playing but they re doing the typical hire thing already and doing the exact opposite of what the community wants game also already has a store button ready to go so id assume it will be pay to win any time now like they did with every single other game they've ever made if you re interested play it now because its probably only gonna get worse their latest patch not only removed the one thing that made their battle royal game unique it also buffed weapons that were already overpowered and were supposed to be nerved and now you can shoot people through corners with them
early access review well as an early access game this one already shows a promising future as as well as some problem this game is surely made to mock some other and it did it its purely simple and good spawning is random and looting is fun that good enough for me plus its free
after a number of hours in game it randomly deleted my save file without any fix seeming to be in sight apparently is just an issue this game can have done invest any time or especially money into this game
the only free play live ever played that int pay town and is of high quality i done always play a lot of free play but when i play free play i play path of exile
never ever even consider downloading this bullshit of a game live wasted like a hours like only getting an understanding of what is happening and what consecutive inputs should i perform not to be yelled at and after some time when live figured out what to do i still get yelled at cut my teammates are in almost every game either toxic pieces of or just with single digit in every game you try your best you do a lot better then your teammates do but these boys just decide to stay ask cut why of not just believe me and never install this thing this game is pure evil genuine source of frustration which gave terrible headache to anyone who ever tried data if you like to lose your like to scream at the screen and argue with pal you'll never ever see in your life its your choice one thousand one hundred and ten
the current state of bless is lacking in many of its content compared to the time given to develop price tag and relative success in other areas in my opinion heres the facts the game though pretty fun early on lack content for late game the game lacks content especially when compared to with the jap version although updates and content are being added its just too slow and little the royal quests and gem fragments are not worth it compared to the effort needed some of community is leaving so that is going to leave a void for groups and player versus player for a new player is very unfriendly with a community of hardcore gamers who will never help instead of helping newcomers they will do a five man dungeon with twenty three pal because most of the pal left are way way too over geared but they want more because is nothing else to do i guess also big guilds recruit pal not to help them but to find players to boost guild points terrible community if you re looking to get this game hold off until the price comes down to ten or less i hope for the people that did spend a lot of money steam will give a refund not only to the streams but to all for such a blunder but i am not holding my breath
live been playing this game off and on for about four years now i keep coming back for every league every three months and play nonstop for about a month until in burned out the developers really try to come up with new and exciting things every league its a game i really like to supportive been a vivid diabolo two three player for many years but diabolo three as much as i love it has nothing on this game constant updates quick bug fixing active community make this game a masterpiece
it makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win there is nothing in this game that you have to buy there are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players live been playing this game since back when there were only four classes and it has evolved and plays beautifully the items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply there are costumes which granted are expensive but you done need them at all they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game arm or that you can easily obtain looks better anyway there are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier ave experience the only thing that i can say is a usual must pay is the second a slot which shouldn't be a paid thing but if you re going to enjoy and play the game a lot then whats eight other than that you done have to buy anything live never expanded my inventory or bank space and i get by just fine and happy now to the game play its an extremely unique massively multiplayer online role playing game that combines two dimensional side scrolling with three dimensional elements it has a unique combo system between its attack buttons and skills and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style each character currently in the game has three jobs to choose from each of which greatly alters your characters play style all and all the games ave is superb and i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together massively multiplayer online now for the player versus player its a very fun experience whether you re casual or hardcore going into it its very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against it comes in the form of one versus one two versus two a and a base race game mode where it falls short sometimes is its balance playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times but its nothing that practice and effort cant solve the biggest issue that live had with this game is latency there will be random moments in ave where ill be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in player versus player along with an enemy lag teleworking around but it all usually sorts itself out overall i believe that this is a great massively multiplayer online that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and i would recommend it to anyone looking for something new
early access review fun and addictive just like super smash bros it has well balanced characters and fun modes the extra party modes are very fun to play especially dodge bomb you'll be sure to have lots of laughs with your friends all this for free
this is a good game it is the closest thing you will get to real life hunting because you done just see a deer every three feet so for those who say it is bad go on a real hunting trip then you will understand
i cant even start the game because of batt eye he says he blocks the file powell hours spend trying to fix this without any results june sex just pas be lancer a cause de batt eye que me dit quiz blue be fisher powell de heres a essayer de fixer a sans resultant
this game started out as a very fun exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing but now that they've patched and updated several more times it has lost its fun factor due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed levels it center without paying money i started playing while they still had levelled planes and such and that was when you could buy the planes without research points which now you have to buy with real money and so you re stuck playing until you have enough research points to buy one plane one you think that you could buy two or maybe three but when you play a battle your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles so if you get this game and think you re going to coast through to the top level be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there
well there is no need to tell you much about this game its just so popular many people consider this game as a piece of artwork true is that it needs a lot of skills to be good in it to be honest its just not my type of game anyway i recommend to try
live recently been seeing all these paid youtube videos about how great this game is which in fact its not clunky movement floaty jumps insane name spam problem in all game modes if you want to get somewhere in a reasonable time you'll have to pay heaps of money pay to win pay to win pay to win sure you can play it completely free of charge but it will not be fun and i would never encourage anyone to spend a single dime on this game
pray to rhesus before entering each match pray to the snail god and pray to the isis six the game is fun till fifty seven that is the tier of the pay town tanks go to sixty seven more than fifty of the teams you are with or against are premiums the is int overpowered you can still kill it from the front guy with sabot or heats to everyone else who doesn't have that i love this game i want it to be fun but i have been getting continuously screwed with ring and just plain old fashion bull start also one thing i noticed it is usually a of stomp in one way or the other one thousand one hundred chance of having an even match fields of norman is cancer look left look right look left move die pretty much how most games go the snail god needs your offerings to get ahead by buying bushes for your tank because that apparently not an advantage but it does give you an advantage release the damn ships already that pretty much all in waiting on once i know that cancer too then i will quit for good this game is really like a drug you love it it only treats you bad but gives you some good kicks not enough keep you but it is so damn hard to leave edit one for people who like stats or whatever i doesn't matter if i get twelve kills or two kill mostly play ground re or air re if your team is trash it doesn't matter how good you are i have eight hundred and thirty victories out of twenty even sixty ines games that pathetic i done understand why my team always loses so much it doesn't make sense at all i done recommend this unless you currently have friends to play with you the grind is real once you get to fifty seven area and you will needs friends in order to help each not fall down the pits of ranges edit the new meta done have fun be fast
i was on the fence about trying this game which does not make any sense since its free i felt like it would be a demo deal where you pay to unlock content but that is not the case the only things i have seen that you can pay for are already available in the world where you just pay for minor convenience or for aesthetic stuff or things that are cool but completely unnecessary i have never played min craft so i done know how it compares other than the fact that in not willing to plunk down the money to try min craft there are two things i really like about this game other than the explore expand and sandbox aspects the first thing i like is that you must constantly protect yourself which makes the game very immersive at nightfall things become a bit more dangerous than during the day so your base and its security are very important it also makes exploring challenging since you must decide to fight on through the night or set up a temporary camp you will find yourself under pressure to use what you have available to quickly build shelter and waiting for daybreak there will be lots to do while in your base so you will not be idle to gather more resources and improve your base i find myself constantly racing against the clock and taking incremental improvement where i can the second thing i like is just how massive the world is it will take you a very long time to get from one end of the map to the other and in not sure how long it would take to explore the whole map but not the am out of time i have with a full time job for me this makes this game have a long burn rate which is really important for me since i get bored quickly with games there are many other good things about this game but it just boils down to the fact that it is a well thought through game with a lot of content and endless possibilities not something i would expect from a free to play game i enjoy this as much as i enjoy runes cape and eve online but both those games have extremely limited free to play versions which is fine the idea is if you like it then pay for it very unlike this game i think there could be more documentation but as of writing this the game is very new in also more a fan of user generated documentation than manual tutorial so this will improve with time
early access review got this game solely for my brother the training course gives you the overpowered guns but when you get the class you equip by guns the next issue i have is that this is wii based and yet we are battling the user get your facts right we did hate the commies but they were our ally in this war the new update has made it impossible for us to win due to the spamming of tanks that are almost impenetrable conclusion this game is still in beta and shows a lot of promise if they fix the game mechanics and balanced the classes and vehicles this may just may be a good game until then i ask those who care about historical battles to wait until the creators of the game fix these issues May
the game itself is very well built its hard to come by a and ice sides roller game with so many options with skill trees job classes and other things that are so small but make such a huge difference biggest problem for me is the fact that if you want to win in this game you need to donate the game is fun casual play but as for wanting to get better its all in how much you pay to win skill only takes you so far in it the community itself has gone very downhill since the game started as well now its full of trolls and people with giant egos thanks to how much they've spent on it reason why i make i recommend it is if you can look past the player versus player and dungeon things it has some nice events to help you reach max level some challenging dungeons and you done need to party with strangers its great to play with friends as for trying to playing play it competitively unless you re willing to spend a ton of cash i wouldn't recommend it
you have to be an enthusiast to enjoy this it is also quite a good memory game how to put things together and to make them work it is not a shooter game as such but a game that some gun enthusiast would enjoy the mechanics of the whole thing work just fine albeit some areas could be improved for instance it will only put parts together that are next on the list it is not quite real when putting a gun together for real there are different approaches you could take but only some will work correctly otherwise the controls are working just fine tip just wait until you get to seven thousands points before you buy anything otherwise you start again point wise
product received for free cant even play this there is a server error saying downloading vital data for the pass three days since sunday i tried contacting support and they wont even contact me back
after seeing a negative review of this game even though the majority like it i wanted to make a review talking about what a great horror game this is first of all its free i really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out kara mari hospital the downloadable content costs just under but if you enjoyed the game i would recommend the downloadable content now in gonna get into the main review the game itself does have a lot of reference but that what makes it great the game doesn't feel like it stole these concepts from anything the closest it gets to other games movies is slight reference if you find jump scares scary get this game if you are unsure try watching mark plier or someone play it hats how i found out about it just make sure you only watch a bits that the game still has some surprises found i rarely died from enemies but that was because i was absolutely terrified of them and wouldn't get near them time to talk about the enemies wont say them all just some stuff to know possible spoiler specimen one the main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outset first they a rent scary but later into the games began to fear them more then the actual enemies they jump scare you but the do it all the time and its terrifying specimen two and three chase you around they a rent the scariest i skipped a bit of the games gonna replay it all soon so i missed the specimen four and five parts they still look spooky though specimen six is well the bane of my existence specimen six is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game as he will stalk you down and slaughter you his death screen terrified me and his area contains a lot of zelda reference which i quite enjoyed just when you play the game be ready for specimen six specimen seven int really scary but it confuses you and makes chases with other monsters much harder specimen eight is the deer god things in his area start out fairly oscar but then eight shows up and the terror begins although not one of the scariest he is probably on the most memorable specimen nine randomly appears if you spend too long in a room i have never encountered him before spoilers he reappears as the final boss of the game whom you battle with an axe it is fun and similar to the canon battle from low of spoilers specimen ten is featured in a cool futuristic area i done entirely remember him but i remember he is very hard to run away from specimen who i refer to as the beef god is one of the scariest enemies in the game i remember him from lets plays of the game so maybe i was just nervous when i entered his area the area he is in is a fast food restaurant area there is a lot to do before meeting him but it is very unnerving especially since the music is terrifying specimen twelve the old man or the mansion is one massive room it takes the place of a mansion here you complete various tasks while running from the old man it was very fun and scary specimen thirteen who i call the siren is a monster very similar to karen from amnesia the dark descent you must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren it was really fun and the area before was very scary that raps up the review of the monster but i have a few more things to say the game doesn't have amazing graphics but that kinda adds to the horror the game has a lot of reference which is one of the best parts of the game this game is terrifying least if jump scares scare you i would definitely recommend this game
early access review based on this amount of minutes i conclude that the game is similar to rob craft but its more of a tactical game your ships move slowly and you take your time to plan where to attack the enemy the controls of this game is not hard although its quite a lot you can view guide for the controls at anytime in the game by pressing the button of and kits not only base on speed and reaction time as strategy zing is taken into account you need to work as a team and you cannot solo rambo style like other action player versus player games
even get through the tutorial too annoying i stopped twice to apply in i edits to compensate for of no one will ever want to do that deficiencies in the options specifically to invert the axis on the mouse and to make user interface text large enough to actually read and then i found that the incessant auction house notifications can not be turned off nor can they be moved out of the center of the screen that was basically a deal breaker too much hostile user interface didst even get into the combat part of the tutorial before i was annoyed right off the game and deleted it
been playing this game since it was open beta it now sucks the deus done care about the players that have been here all these years and ninety of the time pal cant log into it coz it keeps doing errors on sign in and crashing now you cant even make it work in safe mode if you want to get reply annoyed and angry playing a game then this is the one you wanna play otherwise stay away from this piece of cryptic crap in addition to annoying the crap out of you and crashing on login all the classes in the game are broken in sum way all the dunn are also broken and usually the last bosses glitch out or bug and you get nothing coz they cant be killed or you cue and get into a bugged instance glitches out graphical errors on clothing items i a giant spike visible to all while mounted if wearing a helmut this game was a great game since mod four it has slowly slid down the hill thru the sewage pipes and is now a sewer monster of a game and i have serious doubts with the company that makes it as a whole since it seems i cud code the game better than they can and i have rudimentary knowledge of such things anyways if another company gets the game ill play it again for now its being deleted until further notice piece of crap
game crashed on start up five times should have taken that as a warning ran into the first jumps are game glitches then i decided that this game would be better suited as an example of how not to make a game one thousand and ten would waste my time to start this up and have it glitch again
early access review this game is free how about three hundred rooms in game started of very simple just cardboard pictures of cartoon like ghosts and skeletons eventually she starts getting creepy things start chasing you and as research lab databases show there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go i loved the mini games a great relief from the games jump scares although i think jump scares are cheap and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a horror games fax this game uses them effectively creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cutouts while being chased by a head eating resident evil like monster this game has a strange effect as i want to continue on just one room more i tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor which i nervously walk down or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight worth the zero i invested and in looking forward to the one thousandth room if i ever get there game play helpless at the start and so far still like that controls are simple but work effectively graphics simple cartoons at start but develops to much darker images polish funny spooky girl detailed backlog of each monster and fear what more to ask for
by far the best collectible card game on the market right now the game is extremely generous to free to play players if you expect to have a full collection of cards within a week of playing a free game then maybe this game is not for you game play is very well thought out in both balance and mechanics i highly recommend at least trying this game if you have enjoyed other cogs in the past or if you would like to see what the genre is all about
the worst thing about this game are the prices for the more in depth cockpits but most likely if you spend that much on them in the first place it will be very worth it digital combat simulator is nothing short of amazing it feels awesome to fly the planes the learning curve is there but after a few days its all down and good the planes have weight to them and even the simplest of makeovers and procedures cant be done by just jumping in and acting like you know what you re doing if you a rent an experienced pilot no worries you can start with circling airfields and landing at others move onto some strafing runs go to bombings read and by then you'll probably have purchased flaming cliffs three speaking of flaming cliffs three researching the expansion will likely tell you that you need the others which int true anymore its an awesome expansion for learning to fly flaming cliffs three is basically the bridge between the us and aircraft like the a ten a attack jet its a great game and its free to start off if you like aircraft whether it be fax airmail or any other simulator you will like this game also even though the photos show the us and some other planes you cannot fly any planes that a rent a the but or a listed in a downloadable content
early access review could play this game for hours just snowboarding down mountains throw in the fact that it feels less sluggish better optimized and faster paced than pub well in sold my only major gripe is that at longer ranges in which a sniper should still be effective you will see players stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion this makes longer range battles a headache when this occurs if they can polish this up i will be one hundred satisfied with this game the hours of fun its brought me so far has reignited my love for this genre and opened my eyes to the mediocrity were settled with for far too long rip pub
creatives is yet another sandbox game want a description personal description it is basically like the min craft game but with smoother graphics more advanced technologies and much larger content if you have played min craft you will really like this games recommend you guys to try it since its free
this game is a very good combat simulator but there only one thing i done like there are only bad planes that are default there should be more advanced and more manoeuvrable planes as default
the deus just keep delivering such great content for this free to play game other than its grind nature well the deus are called egg a i done find another reason why this shouldn't be the best arg of all time out there it takes some getting used to for new players true but once you do get into it it is hard to leave it aside for too long and while my gaming backlog keeps increasing i cant help but get back to this game every single league
downloadable content the game you can drive one car on one track and watch replays of it fifteen times over again for free and nothing else if you love paying for a game more than once its pretty swell the user interface is keel looking tho one hundred and ten
as a long time mine rafter i kinda think of this as its slightly fancier more challenging cousin laugh out loud the basic concept of grab block place blocks applies daylight cycle of may and sheer terror applies though some of the monsters in this game far surpass min craft in fear factor the crafting though is a hyper improved system of craft this and of look you can now make this kinda pushing you to upgrade and find new types of blocks the biome also feel simply more appropriate in creative soften seeing similar creatures but ones fitting for that zone in color or style i enjoy both but i will say this is free the pro version may be an option someday for the cosmetics but if your looking for a think rebuilding game that free look no further also side note ill be starting a creatives series on my youtube channel soon so there that xmas a side note true sucking up blocks into a glove is crazy but hey so is nearly unlimited storage with no weight hindrance but all games have it May
early access review this game is outstanding basically its a free version of super smash bros i recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a indie action fighting game i play this game every day this game is amazing one of the best plat formers for low spec pcs
been playing this game for a long time now but since the beginning its been horrible and gotten worse since when in the real world can grenade toting enemy take out tanks with a couple grenades its ridiculous even for free its horrible uninstalling
a truly fun and addictive free to play game with stunning graphics and tight controls done need to pay to have fun even if you done enjoy or have played flying games i would highly recommend this
the most interesting scheme it has that it starts like a child spook park but later it changes to adult to reality i would recommend the game it has a decent scare style from calm to insanity boo
most hours spent in my gaming life there int supposed to have a storyline however each character has its unique personality and is very lovable ref valves video clips those characters are not just for visual graphics each to on has a soul and you can feel it in the game simply best game ever and it doesn't get old
i love this game even though this game practical costs a one hundred you still get a great game for not paying the downloadable content i have lots of fun playing it also how is this a adventure a shooter and first person shooter
early access review was a fan of day of defeat and i was looking forward to this allies is axis first person shooter started with semi auto rifle with the germans and looking forward to get a car or a which was my favourite in do rank one to rank quite alright rank to rank of like hours to get it and now rank four to rank which will be double the time i gave up so sick of the same weapon
this game is complete and utter garbage i cant for the life of me figure out how people enjoy games that have a useless control scene that is difficult to change because for what ever reason the game developers decide to make the menus confusing to the point that its hard to find what you are looking to change to should also be noted that it is another free to play game that goes by its stereotype it int easy to play unless you spend well over an hour to even attempt to understand what to do i wish that for once i can find an actually well made game for free that int riddled with micro transactions
a
early access review can honestly say that this game has become complete and utter if you join any match beyond the matches that have everyone using the staring three bots all you will find is helicopters with three blocks and an ultra overpowered weapon and tesla with an invisibility module this int just from salt from dying to tesla stars even though i have its because its so easy to build a tesla that everyone does it and then goes around inst killing each other which is so too boring basically as every other player that played when there was still tech points and not even battle arena mode i wouldn't play this game unless you love to spend hours making a bot of watch it be destroyed in two seconds by a tesla that took someone five minutes
update fifty five is very sad it like you go over to someone house and bend there daughter over and began to give and that what update fifty five us doing bend the player over and give them
the game is awesome i love it but but but update of i do not recommend the game under the explained circumstances but i keep playing the game because i solved the computer behavior i could one hundred predict the computers behavior but its not very easy i spend a whole night to understand the why and found ten rules you can predict the computer and by that i mean cards drawn by the opponent and yourself i made some recordings to prove a one hundred prediction chance of what will happen but the system has two flaws first i was psychotic at this time that means i am able to extremely focus without effort two flaw is there is a particular play style which creates so many possibilities that its at least for me impossible so calculate all resolutions if you want to know about how the computer works and want a detailed explanation whats happening while playing then send me feedback if enough people show interest i create youtube videos with commented game play and turn prediction why the computer at like that and what fails lead to a lost match also i create a list of tips to help understand the computer behavior and rules to rise chances to win basically you never play against human its all about understanding the computers move send me a message show interest and i share my information and hope to develop better play styles and raise win rate thank you just to mention it i am not advertising i am no tuber i am no streamer i done write from stuff i am just a guy playing games and is angry about today player rip of to to make cash legends this pay to win lets solve this and break there system the system short list of pro and contra pro art game feels artificial manipulate the game is build around paying money or live with frustrating time consuming grind the deck is is controlled by the computer and not by the universe like in real so i assume we are not talking about real coincidence with our money just very little reward and not balanced between time spend and rewards claimed paying money will definitely create that balance long version and in depth explanation of my experience it is very unsatisfying that the game is not controlled by the universe instead controlled by a computer which is programmed in a way that the actual game feels unnatural in every match and every round you just get the right card for the last minute rescue or a turn around last minute victory in every single match either me or the opponent get just the right in card for the most obvious game changing resolution problem is i cant prove it but my guts telling me that the computer is not mixing the deck once in the beginning the computer rather calculate and analyse your behavior and moves to keep the win chances for both players fifty until its not possible to correct the player made false decisions its awful assume but i cant prove it that with so much control from a computer maybe the chances to win for a paying customer are higher then for a non paying customer and i done mean the unfair advantages from the cards what i mean is that the win chances may be higher for payers so they are more satisfied for there investment and keep paying while the not yet paying customer put into artificial frustration to force the non payer to pay real money to keep fit for the competition lets be honest this came is a casino a lottery a sot machine its gambling and what happens if the house play by the rules of the universe right the bank is balanced because winning and losing is after one million tries at fifty but that way a cant make money so you have to control the situation just enough so the payer done feel ripe off but the bank still makes money it is awful how obvious the game is completely build around the real money shop no doubt if i weren't such a pain loving machine who loves frustration in a weird way i would have payed real money yet what i did not have so be warned the game knows exactly how to get your money is especially if your not so damn stubborn like me example i played last night seven hours i won three games out of twelve since i hit level twenty one the difficult changed big step before that i had a win rate for like ten hours at around fifty right now a intense match against a human player one versus one will take around two thousand and thirty minutes you need three win to get a reward of fifteen gold and one random card you get experience points for losing and winning per level upgrade which gives a usually a pack of six random cards and gold i think in between you get card upgrades for special cards together for me it feels very unrewarding i can tell you compared to the camp in act one its like ceiling on the beach or struggling truth an or can the caspian against artificial intelligence was so awesome satisfying and felt like it should feel but right after the free experience and even the first arena against artificial intelligence and even the first matches against players you get a big in sign to pay pay pay for me it felt like whoa what the hell whats that mountain doing here suddenly the thing is the full camp in cost extra money but act one was very cool for a card game also the arena a second time was so impossible hard with the same deck i played the first one that i did not even win a single match and wasted one hundred and fifty gold for one hundred and fifty gold you need a won thirty played games with one hundred win rate a two thousand and thirty minutes which make three hundred minutes or five hours in a perfect world also after levelling up form one hundred and twenty four i am right now i felt like the matchmaking put it into real hardcore fights in my opinions just to show me what paying real money can do in this game the game takes care that you done win all the time and it members you very direct when a guy plays a five time combo chain in round four an win two rounds later i mean yeah skill and experience is still important and i am aware that my wrong decisions lead to lost matches and yes i am quite aware that i just try to find a explanation for losing more often then winning so i maybe wrong but since i cant prove many assumptions all i have is my may
early access review yeah in the past few months the updates have been dramatically ruining the game used to be much better personally attempted to contact reno and got banned yeah please done waste your money on this pile of a a a a a
plenty of nasty comments about a free to play game not actually being free duh of free game comes with one rifle one shotgun and the ability to travel almost everywhere and hunt five species every week i got here via the hunter call of the wild which is also a game i did not see myself play but i really like the game forcing me the change in the regular pace of gaming that i do i see this game as its older uglier but still able brother it comes with a subscription based model or licenses to hunt specific species then if you like it as much you can chose to buff up your armoury looks it veteran more digital goods yes confusing but a luxury the game itself is an interesting one its free to try and of this day i have not spend a penny on it yet but considering
so too hours on this game and i still haven grown tired of it really cool game to play with friends well without counting all the pros that there are in this game deleting the beginner servers was a big mistake by the deus but he not a big deal graphics are meh but that not what in going to be focused on the strategy on this game is incredible learning to control a city and paths are really a pain in the to learn but its great it gives the game a new whole difficulty to explore the farming int that bad i would say it is the most relaxing thing of this game tbs without counting the mega zombies those have scared me a couple times experience points normal zombies those is they a rent even difficult to kill they are just annoying they should be at least a little bit more difficult to kill one head shot or two hits from a katanga could be more challenging cars rip they can only be used in private servers unlucky of at least if you find a spawned one a can ride it around tho a its all ways nice not having to pay fifty thousand moneys to go to a city from a farm spot the jump spam just one thing to say a will get used to it the fights between teams are all ways a great way to rob some stuff if a know what i mean wink wink really fun and relaxing to play recommend one hundred to play it with friends done play alone or just going to get butted every time a enter the game cut the hack them mother in pros that done have a life i guess will just quick scope head shot a on sight but away by truly go away from this game done enter this game unless or sadistic like me or ray like challenges like me anyways for who installs this game good luck in this hell land buddhas
twenty million one hundred and forty two thousand and sixteen review this game started out as a beautiful creation this game was an absolutely unique style with its own cartoony graphics followed behind the most best ways of presenting the entire nine man team and their personality however sense the gun mettle update this game has slowly started to slip from its former glory this game started to try and copy counter strike go which ruins what was once so unique about it this game used to be a game that was a different experience all on its own it was a team experience that honestly brought a smile to anyone face from joining their first pub server to leaving their last this game used to be so unique it would pull different players in from everywhere now its trying its best to stay afloat when everyone can clearly see the game is dwindling from its former glory done get me wrong i love team fortress two however this game has run out of update ideas it hurts to see that the updates are pay to join and have become pay to get a crate to just pay for a key for that crate boxing used to be a optional thing and it still is but its being pressured to inbox more and more by valve with every single update i have had my fair share of the whole experience in this game and this review is coming from someone who has seen it all i have seen the trader experience and the player experience this game offers i have crossed the battlefield of man versus machine i have run across the pubs i have joined every update and i can conclude that this game is losing its spunk help steam community have had a couple ideas for updates in maybe medic makes some sort of mistake and one of the characters get to become female i know many of you agree most likely female characters would be a huge change in this game that would make both an interesting sam and an interesting update it would be one that is completely free for the team fortress two community and it would be one that allows a female player to become a female character regardless this is my opinion on it i have watched friend after friend cash out on this game and slowly walk away from the memories they made with every step it is your choice to play or not to play what role you take is all your own decision here are a couple videos of my play through to see if you still want to play or not to play tips wow youtube co watch virzcvgtewqhttps wow youtube co watch plaza spicy
free good time waster no need to log every day to collect a silly bonus or to keep your dwellers alive like in the usual facebook games however it really needs to option to save your game on cloud i played it before on phone then i moved to bethesda net losing all progress i manage to transfer my progress after i migrate to steam but if anything will happen with my hard disk drive i may lose it forever May
early access review wow this is unreal and i mean it the hit box and all it something to laugh at and then on top of that all the patch the little kids cry about and all get done and then done get started on the hackers so many videos out there showing the hacking and all is so unreal and nothing is getting done about it like after one or two days after a patch there was a video with new hacks like they need to get something about that like hunt down the sites and find out who is all doing it unlike footnote there suing the hackers not the makers and even pal that show that there not doing anything about the hacker and show it still works and all just like this game they done care they want hackers to ban and get them to buy more of the game like pub by that means more money and not to stop the hacker means less money for them this right now is sofar out of ten games i have seen four speeders and four to five aim bot more then half way a cross the map like update the anti cheats every other day this will for sure stops more then eighty of them and ban them for good
the game is designed and ran in such as way as to separate you from as much money as possible decks are being power crept out of the game practically every month with a slightly more efficient oak build being released in every new box near enough every game is decided with a combination of rock paper scissors and a coin flip are you playing the latest meta deck or a specific counter if yes flip a coin if tails you go second and oak them for the win if heads you go first watch your board get wiped and old there is very little interactivity in the game beyond this at the moment as a new player you will get enough new gems to pick up the cards you need for the latest oak deck after this you might even earn enough gems for the next latest but sooner rather than later you'll find your supply of currency drying up and any sort of vaguely competitive player versus player will become impossible and you are absolutely screwed if you want to build any of the older archetypes that are often spread a cross three or four boxes at this point you will either quit the game or become a whale throwing money at it until you suddenly realise just how much fun you could have been having spending that money on something else if you have the disposable income or are strong willed enough to grind completely free to play and done intend to engage in serious player versus player matches you might find some enjoyment otherwise i would highly recommend avoiding especially if you lack self control when it comes to premium
early access review no i only have one a of the game but for now i cant recommend this game i no it is early access but games feels soon empty boring world it i so quiet like it has no purpose very little items you have here of all battle royal game i think this one is the most empty the only like biggest thing here is types of weapons and even that there are not that many most weapons are boring and useless no one even use most of them many are still not optimised feels wrong when shooting upgrades on guns means and feel almost nothing with or without almost the same thing after the new game update game feels even more realistic in wrong whey it doesn't matter what you have on to die in twenty three bullets all those equipment now means nothing in the game really with of without you die in twenty three bullets the worst thing here is optimizations and pal are so tired of this even if the game is early aces the game look like older gen from twenty elevens twenty twelves i no i done have high end machine but for for this game i have what gypsy more than enough requirement to play and i barely play on low a and three thousand five hundred and forty five first person shooter the game already feels dead every time i wait for player i wait for forty five min org already many times makes me want to quit of boredom really not good i think this is just another random game that will die in couple of years it will never feel good of finished or optimised to play well and enjoy
now this game is really addictive but it has some problems like the spawn system and game mechanics like the fact that you can to go trough a wooden fence with a tank even with full speed air planes are kinda over powered since they are hard to kill and they can spam bombs the spawn system is annoying because of the amount of waiting you need to do is huge reasons for that are spawn deploy queue travelling to location and many others also the spawn points are simply cancer because they are so easy to spawn camp with a tank or sniper the biggest reason why i don to recommend this game is that i like realism specially in a world war two game and i love tanka plane combat and this games vehicle combat is rather buggy go ahead and download this game try it the game is addictive and fun but someone like me these little problems will ruin the fun
this is yet another game that i wish steam had a neutral rating for its decent for what it is but overall its pretty meh pros a game that can be played with one hand that has hot anime style chicks moaning cons everything else i was hoping this game would be better because a know boobs however that about all it has to offer yes its free but even so it seems hastily put together to capitalize on the clicker game trend adding nothing new to the formula besides breasts if that all you want then its fine but it gets boring pretty quickly other wise of and it has downloadable content outfits for some reason because a know money play it free and enjoy the jiggles and you'll be of
early access review frames and unplayable i die in thirteen hits and i cant even find people why is everyone wearing black in a in winter map think about the decisions you make roe make a community forum or something to help push decisions you re sitting on a gold mine but choose not to strike gold why are the graphics the same no matter what if your run max and low make a potato graphic for people who cant even shoot the gun last update was not great for this game
early access review pros free to play good gun variety smooth pamela solid graphics very fun will run on low specs easy learning curve friendly community cons too simple map only thirty four game modest enough gear variety armour equipment grenade join no safety if you need a clan wow no safety com
early access review my this game is so bad the deus do whatever the fucking they want no wonder why it only has two thousand players the game had the potential to compete with other big battle royal games too bad it was made by hire
product received for free early access review spent so much time getting higher armoured blocks forty hours then they updated only making one type of block and they didst even give me a refunding a next time tell us your gonna us over
all the money spent and all that time spent on this game and yet foreigner remained stubborn in its way in order to milk this game to its fullest it is unfortunate that this game is so niche that there no real alternatives i do not recommend anyone new to start this game because you re only going to expect disappointment and anger
although it is a free to play due to how much it restricts the player unless they pay for the items and no you cant even use in game cash the game might as well have a price to it and even then i done think they would allow you to unlock all items that would have been locked through a pay wall it is fun but it quickly gets boring because of how large the restrictions are at the very least allow us to use the in game money
early access review try to play one game i have never played before i made an account started matchmaking and it says that i have been cheating on my personal computer and it based me never played one game
eight go for one race track is more than a little too much in guessing all the downloadable content is included from the start off its a cool game to play and the handling is pretty decent and it has external wheel and pedal support at least its not bad but hardly great either i just have it installed because i done have any other games that support the wheel in order for this to really be worth recommending it need a few more tracks and much cheaper car extra track unlocks there some bugs where you drive through obstacles and get disqualified for ranking a time on that lap you have to keep driving the whole lap before that flag resets its a bit frustrating
review for spooky jump scare mansion for copycat graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don to look too long at it paint exam play addictive like heroin very good good its just game play mesh starring at walls is better just don audio orgasm very good good not too bad bad array audience kids teens adult pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boil iii ask casa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press a easy significant brain usage easy to learn hard to master difficult dark soul grind nothing to grind only if a care about leader drinks int necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you all need a second life for grinding story there is no story text or audio floating around average depends an downloadable content good lovely it all replace your life game time long enough for a cup of tea short average long to infinity and beyond price there is no price worth the price if a have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying assassins creed unity the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
early access review this in game is awful my friend recommended this game because he loved adventure quest worlds big mistake the ign starting area is impossible my friend who is level three died to a level three frog ard and he bonded and i died six times trying to find don notes done download this piece we have to find thirty flying eye wings in zone that has only nine admonitions of flying eye
if they turned this into a pay to play game and instead of buying gear with cash make you work for it but not like china farmers hard laugh out loud but get better and better gear as you clear more difficult content i think this game would be huge but they way it is now its a a a a a a a a you cant even buy more inventory slots unless you pay one thousand and twenty bucks a pop that insane when i used to play when level sixty was cap i didst pay for much i did buy one more bag for inventory but i had my char pretty geared up with the daily and getting all the diamond cash from refining it it was not bad but now its stupid you can buy a whole new upgraded computer and play some other games with a a to with the money you will need to spend at level seventy deus got really greedy not worth the time even though it is a good game just the pay to not even win but to get regular stuff outta hand screw these deus for doing that to a great combat and pretty deep class building do game shame on all
first thing you should know about planet side two is that its a game in a league of its own cause its scale is huge compared to any other fps pros one the games bloody massive the maps in this game are four entire continents with different climates where factions made up of thousands of players battle each other for territory this means you'll see huge battles with hundreds of people at one facility and battles with as little as zero people a you re total free to do what you want the game is basically an organized free roam first person shooter with optional objectives so you can do what ever the hell you want wether its squaring up into a large platoon to strategically take over bases or simply doing your own thing around the continent alone or with a few buddies just to have fun its not pay to wine very single weapon or vehicle in the game can be bought with certs that are earned from getting experience points even if the grind is really really long awesome variation of different classes there are a bunch of different classes which give really cool perks like invisibility jet packs increased shields act so you can play with any play style you like on only thing that the game could really improve on are the buildings they re kinda just empty rooms with a few boxes and benches and stuff
three things i love most in this world as of right now gaming vikings and dragons so why not combine all three well would you combine donuts alfredo and sushi yeah neither would i
do you like tanks do you like planes do you like world war two games because this is one of the best free online games on steam taking place in a world war two setting you can join the american side the russian side or the german side with your choice you are subject to diverse weapons vehicles and character personalization of that country there is an advancement system of ranks which is achieved when you gain experience from battle fight in large maps to aid your country in the war or fight in a skirmish map for practice and less experience gain heroes and generals is unique with its scenery an the maps created are greatly designed for the action that ensues i myself thoroughly enjoy this game and always come back to it again and again playing it to enjoy the thrill of my team all charging in with vehicles and on foot heroes and generals definitely deserves a better rating
good game i have been reading some reviews of this game and none of them said that you can get most of pay to win item with in game currency some of them a rent but you can gift them and the prices for them a rent really that high you the most must buy item is skill slot a that cost around mil to to mil and taking into a count that you get mil doing all story quest up to lvi eight five so you will get it and once you get really late game you can get easily about mil weekly so the game int a hard pay to win taking into a count all of this the good thing of this game this game is unique there int a lot of game like this that int from the same davis fun to play and there is a lot of variety of classes to choose from when you find people to with the game become a lot easier the bad things about this game this game is all about grind this game is way to unbalanced you have classes that are garbage at everything they can dom looking at you craw and others that are plenty broken in everything they do like lucien and ayala the community is mostly edgy kids and people that do a dungeon run while they wait to their league queue the duns are repetitive and the animations that at the start look amazing and immersive are annoying later ghost have a banana weapon skin the game dost even try to explain the most complex thing like pocketing and enhancing the tutorial is the most useless and annoying in this game dost release some content because of money having to run the same dun three and more times is boring
so as of now it wont let me create an account it just broke this is honestly it looked like a lot of fun and though it was free i just couldn't make an account it sent me to the website to create it and i did that and at first it seemed to work but then it showed an error sign then my email got verified so i cant retry this sucks
early access review lets get right into it why does another battle ground need to exist well lets talk about what makes this game different than its popular competitors choose your class warrior assassin engineer mage or hunter all have special abilities weapons and passives no healer but there is some support builds that warriors and engineers can go for ride a horse mount to ride through zones when outside disenchant obsolete items to create materials to craft legendary arm or weapons abilities and potion look for forge smoke to spot enemies who are crafting swoop in eliminate them and steal the legendary loot when your he reaches zero you are poly morphed into a chicken survive as a chicken for thirty seconds and you will revive if you die as a chicken or get poly morphed three times and you are eliminated this is a simplified explanation but there is a lot more i could ramble on about but honestly you should just get in and give it a try the game is very early access and needs to be polished but plays well and the game is being updated and improved very rapidly is its amazing how people over react to a bad patch yes this latest patch has its flaws but it solved a lot of other issues with the game most people read the patch notes and immediately freaked out most of these bad reviews come from that drama if people actually played the patch they would see that the pace of the game is a lot better and overall the game still feels like the game we all enjoyed from day one
product received for free early access review used to love this game deus of heroes and generals if your reading this the game would be much more enjoyable if everything in the game fifty off it takes weeks just to get a log or a pistole so please make a change and stop making dumb vehicle to hide the truth
early access review this game is already good in alpha cant wait to see what the ten looks like totally worth the one thousand the game play and rules are simple but the tactics and stats can get very complex
early access review would recommend this joke battle royal game if they didst install some game agentive never heard of and didst add it to my startup programs game is okay tons of clipping issues and buggy game play have fun climbing that ladder
early access review well at first i thought it was just a pub clone but when i played i found out its kind of more fun for me and i have pub so there are issues like i snipe a guy with a sniper in the head and he survives but hey its a beta so its of it have a lot of potential and i hope more people will start playing it already have all of my friends download it so give it a try guys
the game controls feels weird the game is broken practice my screen keeps rotating clockwise my fire button stopped working it int really a good game as it is a finished game if it is a early access game then i would be alright in disappointed
early access review to the people in and comparing this to min craft come on bra before talking smack at least play five hours of the game where to start well the building system is one of the best i be ever seen the graphics is pretty good and gathering materials is easy as hell not gonna lie its a bit hard in the beginning but it gets much easier later on
hello there now live only played this game a little i promise there are a few things that hire could work on and live emptied my wallet a few times all have been worth it its a great game with a great concept with them currently enhancing old skins and even remodelling people in fairly confident this games easily one of my favourites
early access review the latest update on sixty two thousand two hundred and eighteen has ruined the game unless they revert the changes to the forge as well as the legendary weapons dropping from any crate this is not worth playing such a shame because this game was great rip
early access review really enjoy this game the matches are quick brutal and and require a lot of teamwork starting with ship selection the ships are varied with many quirky features it takes time to master each so i done mind the grind as each one is pretty fun to play for an early access alpha its very nice way to send thousands of people to their deaths in order to capture an enemy base or some such
this game is glitchy and has terrible graphics with no story just mission after mission while you may be able to limited customise your character and dragon it crashes and freezes even on a high end computer randomly the game also has many spots where you can glitch through the ground and walls May
early access review had fun until i realised that as everything cost money even reloading ammo free from crates presented a bill at the end of the battle and that my soldiers cost more than they made per battle the only way to play was with the basic rifle boring boring boring when there are planes tanks snipers on motorbikes and i was there as server filler to give them something to shoot at graphics are not great which i would have forgiven if i didst think i was being milked for my cash avoid
very high knowledge cap required for mastery of the game you do not need to actively trade but it is highly advantageous and encouraged no auction house but there are selling threads on the main site and spinoff sites that work decently well the deus are very active in the game and produce a new expansion that consists generally of new game that require you to learn how to rise above it this happens on average every four months the game is not overly grind to level to where the majority of people are at if you know what you are doing but is extremely grind to get to max level the good part of that is it is not needed to be that high of a level by any stretch of the imagination there is lag that will hit you frequently more or less depending on your sharply style and that is a fault of the client to server communication but you can help to make it less frustrating by making a macro that types los out of sync extremely fun to make new build characters and actually encourages this behaviour the game is very challenging however it rewards you for overcoming its difficulty the only negatives i can really list is the lack of an auction house system the lag that sometimes happens and it is very recommended to purchase bank space if you want to be an active successful merchant but the prices on all the micro transactions are very reasonable and are not game altering ala pay town lots of cosmetic micro transactions that are really cool if you like that kind of thing
not bad in parts but sick to death of the people that instantly kill you every single time even if you no weapons and the constant game crashing and disconnecting from servers needs sorting out i met about maybe fifty six folk that wont kill you soon as they see you the rest are just trigger happy kids that done give a toss sort it out
great game developer listen to its player base and try there best to improve the game game play is fun grind farming style of game but also casual play available too overall eight thousand five hundred and ten
early access review the first time i played this game it was alright it had the typical tech tree system you see in some other games of the same nature but in this one you created your own fighter with its own special mechanics you had to get quite invested into a certain branch in the tech tree to get the best part from it which is good that makes sense then i sorta drew away from the game as i started playing others i came back a while later after my friend started playing and said i should re download so i did and i played an what so now your level is linked to the parts you can buy help in a pretty high level so this shouldn't be a problem then i repeat uninstall wait re download what the hell so now you can buy any goddamn part you want the game seems to have transformed from a competent fun action game into this mess of micro transactions yes crates in game currency we done need the old fans just grab in some new players and make them buy stuff this game doesn't need anymore dedicated players who could've spent hours trying to get a single part now you can buy that and give us more money
this game is truly surely real freaking amazing only discovered this game a few days ago and i wish i had sooner now all that left is to convince the friends of how good it is its real freaking good massive battles an unbelievable experience kinda feels like star ship trooper the movie but without the allies would you like to know more try it love it this game is that good
early access review was obsessed with this game really fun and spent hours playing until they changed everything fun about it now its all about payments its just stupid matching lvi a with lvi hundreds so if you really want to have a chance to win you need better equipment and here come the boxes they just suck plus it is really hard to get something valuable now i am just tired of playing this nonsense they ruined it with the new eco system if you are just starting you are going to have a bad time
early access review really good game but could use maybe a ranged weapon like a bow or rifle maybe they could add magic cells like a fire one that would shoot fireballs and to make it you need lave over all great game one thousand and tend
early access review would like to state up front in no expert at this i will try my best i really like this game several walls need to be smoothed out so when you walk into them and then you climb the wall all in all its a very fun game i played the first game in the series a few weeks after it was released and i really enjoyed it skip forward a year and then you have the two dimensional massively multiplayer online we all know and love and just like its first humble regaining i am sure once the game is fully finished and all the areas are added it will bring back the joy we all had when we first made our first account only to make another because we forgot the password i rate nine hundred and ten
played for roughly two hours the best part of this game is the character creation screen though graphic wise its pretty good looking that where it ends for whatever reason optimization is horrible the game runs best on max settings then it does on lower settings class wise the way to level up skills and chaining them int really explained too well its a learn as you go type thing mounts have energy and if you run our you cannot mount till it recovers or you use an energy recovery potion side quests a rent really explained what to do especially the gather ones where it doesn't even tell you where to gather the items at i hit level eleven within those two hours and was on a main mission quest where you had to kill a level one elite ghoul it will one shot you dealing one thousand four hundred damage to you which is unavoidable if you re melee balance wise the game is a giant joke you can one shot certain mobs and in return get one shot by mobs you must kill to progress the story mission quests i also ran into a bug where by dying to that level eleven ghoul and selecting to spawn at the ghost instead of having to spend gems to re spawn right where i was i would fall through the world over and over again unless i was able to time running the instant my characters ghost touched the ground all in all its a sorry excuse for a game i understand personally now why it has failed in every region it has ever come out in on my honest opinion as someone who been playing mos since two thousand and two done bother with this one let it die alone in a corner and go to something else its not worth the time
early access review early access review pros free two play not a pay to win game hope it will stay like that kill based fighting mechanics decent amount of content so a developers who actually care about their game many deus nowadays just release the game and not care about icons servers can be saggy sometimes since europa server was added it lang less the community is relatively small pal ray need to play dis
there seem to be a lot of negative reviews related to this games free to play model most people seem to label it as pay to play which is and int true to get full use of the game at all times you do have to have a subscription membership however there are several animals you can hunt at all time regardless of the subscription and there are rotating weekly animals that you also gain access to again to get the full experience you will need to spend some real money but if you re just looking for a well built hunting sim to spend a couple hours a week hunting whitetails you done need to spend a penny and that definitely a win in my books i will list the subscription options below duration cost three months nine hundred and ninety nine us six months one thousand eight hundred and ninety nine us twelve months three thousand four hundred and ninety nine us so for only thirty five you get a full year of full access they also offer starter bundles for fifty you get a twelve month membership and all that entitles you to as well as nine weapons and thirty five items these are permanent unlocks and will remain available even if your subscription expires
early access review therese better massively multiplayer online role playing game games out there that works better than this graphics pc movements skill display hope this game gets developed as a a or down the drain it goes flush wash hands with soap i wont recommend you buying it now tho
trove is a pretty fun game until you get to the later levels where it becomes a complete grind fest there very little actual game play content in the game basically the game consists of farming dungeons mining and farming biome for crafting resources there plenty of to unlock but most of the things you unlock done really feel all that special for example the mounts in this game all have the same stats so there no point to getting more of them the endgame in this game is nonexistent consisting of shadow arenas and the sky realm both which are still just places to grind its fun for a couple hours so that why i recommended it people say its addicting and for the first one thousand and twenty hours its fun but the constant grinding becomes repetitive and boring after a while in short if you like grinding get this game if you done try this game out anyways its free also done be fooled by the my download you still need to download about my through glyph trio worlds own launcher its garbage but its not a deal breaker
died many times made many characters they died as well this game requires a lot of time they say that dies too in this game many may find this as a pay to win game i find many ways to have fun in killing myself May
early access review to anyone considering this game sorry but you missed the window of when it was good ultimately the point of a game is to have fun and right now it is not fun it used to be fun to build fun to play even sometimes fun to lose however the last half year have been stripping this away and now after the past couple of months it is no longer fun even to win a game when winning losing and building are all a chore and not fun it is a sign that the game has failed in the very mission i have been playing this game for over one thousands hours counting the stand alone launcher i started back when it first went on steam and although i wish i could give it a good review at this point i simply cant the developers had a fantastic game that needed a few tweaks a little balancing and some bug fixes but was otherwise really good then starting around november twenty fifteen they began doing major updates that completely broke multiple aspects of the game these updates came about more and more often worst of all they completely changed the direction that the game had been going thus veterans such as myself who fell in love with game a and were excitedly waiting its finished product instead now have game a and dread its completion i tried to keep playing but they just keep making it more difficult to stick with it everything feels gimmicky and very much like a smartphone app game balance is worse than ever and long time elements of the game were broken ultimately it feels like the game is intending to drive away veteran players in favor of casuals very sad to say but at this point i shall no longer be playing except to test periodically and see if the game has been fixed to the greatness where it once was barring that i just cant seem to bring myself to even finish a round november
early access review really wish i could recommend this game i really do but i just cant there are so many flaws in this game that just leads me to a no the game play in this is actually pretty fun its not your typical cod game where you re a one man army unless you are a pay to winner which is a different story there are multiple branches of the milit aries each with their own unique vehicles and weapons same goes with the three factions united states germany and the soviet union but it just takes so damn long to level up its a pain all of these branches have a rank requirement fri it took me a while to get to level four making around four hundred thousand six hundred of a score each round i like a good challenge personally but it takes such a long time to level up once you get there each weapon has its own different stats weight space it takes up damage it center one weapon might look like it sucks and it might but its all dependant on how you use them some weapons might also one shot you its annoying even when you know you were at full health but a head shot almost always on shots i done know what else is happening if it was in the torso its annoying as hell honestly and some weapons need to be balanced pay to winning is a constant annoyance yes the game is free and the developers need to make money i understand that i even bought some gold to support the developers when i thought this game was good at the time they are hard at work and do deserve it but the pay to win is just horrible you could've just unlocked the tank crew class and if you had enough gold you could immediately cheat your way to get the most powerful tank in the game the quality in this game is meh the graphics are pretty good for what it is it int a top tier graphical game which i personally like as it does take as much memory and doesn't ruin your first person shooter the gun sound quality though i hate it it sounds like you re firing a paint ball gun and nothing real at all i done care for this but it makes me feel like this is something the developers neglected overall five hundred and ten this game needs work it has its ups and downs if there was a sideways button labeled meh i would be chosen it but this int the game for you if you re not a patient person or could easily rage play it if you want but you will run into some problems
early access review looks pretty terrible gunplay another pub clone trying to grab the battler yale spotlight seriously same fonts as pub the games pretty and was fun for a while its just who sees the other person first wins
early access review its like black shot except there less hackers and more fun and not pay to win it will be great if there more weapon tho and even better if they decide to add driving mode knifes only mode of and plus plus for the love of god show the damage that is given sometimes it took me like fucking ten bullets to kill a guy its okay that i died in the game i can accept that what i cant accept however is knowing that you nailed fucking eight hundred and ten bullets to the enemy face and they done die at least knowing the dog gives kinda closure
the game is fun and all but once you start playing ranked one versus one or two versus two its just tits not more fun its just rage after rage and no matter what you do you will always get matched with people that are better than you and then you just feel nothing more than rage i do not recommend that game even thought i have nearly three hundred hours on it its no more fun its all rage
it is a nice sims type game adapted to the fallout series it requires a different attention than normal personal computer games as this was designed for mobile i will keep it windowed from time to time while in watching other stuffs in my personal computer even though it is free it has their micro transactions to play it faster and easier i spent the five starter pack and it was worth it get you faster to the optimal game but it games less challenging sooner
it came out cow co moscow
the key feature that absolutely saves this game is auto play without that your semi pointless duel grinding would be more obvious thanks to the auto play system you can forgive the lacklustre card pulls and rewards the game gives you overall this is going to be a very given take yugo game being ftp some of the latest cards are going to be here but then many cards will never be here for balance reasons even the basic essentials are missing luckily because of this you cant really pull anything good with in game currency or real currency the urgency to spend real cash is lowered and since the console versions are rare now a days you just gotta swallow that hard pill and play if you wanna duel this is your latest most update yugo game love it or hate it six hundred and ten
early access review bug de sync mess looting is time consuming and get a car or rip footnote building shooting was not the battle royal experience i was looking for realm royal simple but with unique twists shooting feels accurate in enjoying it would recommend
how to play this game to chill and have fun with no stress at all pick good company you enjoy being with select hardest artificial intelligence available make sure it is not against humans select servers to play as far away from russians as humanely possible done kill your own men in the back while they fight have a glass of orange or apple juice and pizza with your game done forget to commend your try hard carry and your supports after games if done the right way you done have stress and this game can be actually quite fun and very very enjoyable
when i first started playing it was a great game one of the best player versus player games out there if not the best now you either are targets for the pay people or you end up doing coop so chose is do i want to be a target for people or do i want to be a target for the computer either way it is frustrating to say the least i keep coming back hoping for more balance but it just keeps getting worse next step delete bye
early access review better than pub better optimized runs without crashing no network lag it center smooth game play mechanics its my favourite battle royal not really into the latest update so much other than some of the improved graphics i hope ten cent reads through the reviews and learns what the community like dislikes about the game and makes changes accordingly
to say i have played a lot of this game would be an understatement to say this is a great game is an overstatement this game will gobble up hours of your life and spit out fury and frustration get this game
good game for people who like the locked on attacks and almost no dodge mechanic has a good story but it is wanting for some important quests instead of many mini quests game can get boring because of the time it takes to level up when you get above lvi twenty five player versus player is of but is super boring fighting normal enemies makes my adrenaline pump for than player versus player all the classes seem to be balanced but in player versus player the ranger plays hide and go seek this game is fun for those who like a bit of grind and large thirteen a one boss battles total recommend this game
clicking simulator yes bad not if you like that sort of thing laura clicker is a game about clicking on women some of whom are dressed to look like certain animals until they drop gold would this be a ripoff if it cost money yes does it cost money no but you can buy outfits for seventy nine pence gap each to make your character more scantily dressed its definitely enjoyable if you like this sort of thing my question though is why buy the auto clickers some of the fun of this game at least for me is cough admiring my adversaries before defeating them cant do that if your auto clickers one shot them now can you verdict could probably have more features but for what it costs nothing id say its pretty good
is more a simulation than anything else except to put in time to learn it on your own and read the manuals there is a lot you can learn to do in every plane if you know how also think of the free version as a free trial and each downloadable content plane a squeal game each one adds as much content as its own games through the many systems and weapons and missions you could now do
feel like in cheating using the steam very of this game so in going to play this how it is men to be played and that is by smartphone those who play blitz on steam and the windows ten very are just making a poor excuse by playing this version against people who are at a severe handicap i say remove this from steam and get rid of the personal computer user base off the mobile very all together there is a personal computer version of this game and it is men to be played on personal computer not this the only reason for this to be on here is to encourage the pay to win aspect that is not present in the personal computer version and increase their profit gains not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these things but its not right to mix mobile with a personal computer user base since my disgusting sixty three win rate at almost two thousands games on this new account alone and a fifty three win rate on mobile
very addictive game many options to develop your vault the small downside i experience is that it takes quite some time to make some money with money you can develop your rooms you will get there eventually but you'll need to play for a while i really like the game play and the detail of the characters and rooms i would definitely recommend this game
early access review black squad is a neat arcade multiplayer first person shooter featuring familiar game play to counter strike go heres a summary positive great variety of original weapons to choose from all around the world from the rare american or to the famous chinese by rifle very decent graphics thrilling and fast paced game plaits free negatives poor optimization performance issues are frequently reported in the forum awkwardly designed maps with obvious choke points and repetitive pamela many of the weapons are paid dec sporadic balancing issues such as one sided maps and overpowered weapons overall the game is a damn blast when you re winning and offers a great cheap alternative to counter strike go especially for our fellow bankrupt comrades who cant afford it its a neat free to play game that guaranteed to bring you at least three minutes of fun so why not
if torchlight ii is what diabolo three should have been then path of exile is what titans quest ii would have been a fresh storyline an open ended skill system and a sphere grid passive skill web that would make fax blush make for excellent character customization opportunities
early access review very solid game for a free to play does have in game transactions but they are not really needed to have a good experience highly recommend to people who like the feel of csc battlefield very good game
trove is mixed for me but i still love to plan it when i am bored when a start off a are given eight classes chooses i believe it is very fun at the start when a got your first class but also pretty boring for example i know there are event days but levying up is pretty boring i do recommend this game even tho its boring to start off with it get much more fun when a are levelled up challenge yourself and getting better items have fun with is games if a are looking for help and a want to play with me just send me a message on steam and yeah go
product received for free great alternative style mob far from a laugh out loud or data clone and amazing to boot one of the only games you get the satisfaction of commanding ships sometimes over a pm long very heavily team based as most mobs are communication is key if you re a space and mob fan this is your thing id like to add this is probably the most underrated game on steam the deus give away so much cool stuff for free inc skins game modes maps and ships community is only slightly salty too
never winter is one of the very few mos that i am actually willing to play not being a big fan of the genre but being a big fan of do i quite enjoy the game the controls are simple enough to get use to and you have a good range of classes if you play for free getting things in game can be pretty expensive but its not something you have to worry about the game is perfectly playable without the in game purchases
product received for free early access review welcome to super smash bros hmm i men to say is braw halal sorry i got confused any way great game sub but for the personal computer also like how you can use a controller to if you done like key and mouse any way great game overall
it takes about one thousand five hundred and twenty first person shooter if your personal computer has two hundred and ninety two gigahertz ram but its pretty cool when you play it for me its like massively multiplayer online game min craft and cube stuff but with more cool things like classes my fax is gunslinger
early access review love this game bought the season pass because i like it so much recommend to anyone who likes any of the battle royal games your really not going to be disappointed
early access review its hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played every often they even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like i i felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made and that these team based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times as every time i upgraded my parts i still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than i do trying to constantly change my play style to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted and flight is just as bad there is no way in hell as a beginner class are you going to be able to fly decently in this game especially after the most recent patches i last saw the games deus have basically de with the game so much that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since i first saw it which was two years ago it would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with in other words if it int broken done fix it and its surprisingly still in early access i still done understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement because i really doubt it has gotten any better since the day i uninstalled it the only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot whether on wheels feet or in the air the creativity part of this game is what makes it good the major downside to this is how limiting the parts are which in order to get any more of these things you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on is how much you actually get per round
its a great game but it is a very difficult its not a game you can just pick up and play it may take hours to learn how to fly some of the jets but it is such a great feeling after you have taken out an enemy jet May
as someone who always needs an idea and never knows how to get started when i do get one in a fan of the blueprint system in this game i like the challenge of gathering the materials for the build and the custom ability of the blocks in the blueprint doesn't limit my creativity the abundance of recipes and blocks make it so you wont grow easily bored when you re working on a build or focused on terra forming the perfect spot for a build its really easy to get sucked into the game personally i have a tendency to wander so the map and are great for when i lacking any sense of direction inevitably get lost live scattered projects across many biome and i still haven fully discovered the world in which in currently playing creatives is a great game to play alone or if you've got pm with friends i started this game while it was in its early access stages and its been great to see how much its grown since then that said however i do wish they would add more content to bring my friends back into the game as i know they done like that there not much to do or see in the game lately there a lot more they could do with it and i hope to see it soon
i have played team fortress two for four years this update is the worst ever why valve didst answer expectation i liked team fortress two i was sad in sad valve i put a cucumber in the your as a
early access review requires a lot of teamwork still needs a bit of work its worth ten bucks even though within the next year or so it shall be free to play the only thing i think it needs is an explanation of the different weapons and upgrades for the ships
so far i like it also its a freaking free to play you people about everything because you have it good edit i quit playing for simple reason its way to addictive i still think its good game but i became bit obsessive with it laugh out loud
so i played this game back when you paid for it once and then played it was good the environment want complex but it had enough in it to make ship positioning interesting and strategically relevant there were just a handful of ships to choose from and they were distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally the community of players was pretty fun to play with too now the game is free but actually not the current total cost of all downloadable content is seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety six the game is not good jumping from one tiny box to another makes everything feel cramped and more congested than before flying now feels like driving in los angeles ship positioning is mostly irrelevant because there are very few long sight lines left the ship design has gotten lazy and its hard to tell one conglomeration of plates and girders from another anymore and the player community well read the other negative reviews most of which are well thought out and written by experienced players and then read the comments on them the people who attack the writers of those reviews personally instead of reading and responding to the criticism that the current player base its like playing with all the people you know and love from youtube comments the recent updates are a pretty naked cash grab and done make the game play better than it was pay to win and loot boxes this sort of thing is so disgusting it should result in developers being ostracized by the game community at large a would probably give you a medal though maybe if you re hurting for money you could sell out to them in sure you all would get along famously
early access review easily the best digital collectible card game live played not only does it have a deep and complex card system it also has a slick and responsive interface its like taking hearthstone and making it almost as complex as mtg so you have the easy to use interface of hearthstone but all the fun card interactions of a more complex collectible card game also they are extremely generous with cards hearthstone has a rate of one carper minutes spent roughly in estimating between gold gain and dailies eternal has a rate of one carper minutes spent once you get past the early game card bonanza and the packs are much larger so even the cash shop prices are twelve to the as expensive per card on top of that buying any amount from the cash shop guarantees you three packs of cards for every expansion they release in the future including three packs immediately
early access reviewed with the game being in early access i pretty much expected bugs etc done get me wrong i do enjoy this game but this game needs quite a bit of improvement first off we need better servers or at least be able to see what the ping on the server sim annoyed with entering in to a server and it lagging quite hard on me time to time and going back to smooth etc what ever you dodona aim down your sights i experimented with it and when i was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building so you might as well just shoot from the hip if you get shot in the head with any gun pretty much full fall over dead every time so if you run across a hacker aim otter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill the besides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in it though on the bright side at least it int pay to win and you get a large variety of gun but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you want as my personal favourite is the as al so despite the lag and spawn kill element the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future so i guess i can recommend it i at least had a little bit of fun on the game
early access review eternal is an excellent of friendly digital card game with engaging game play deeply flexible dec building mechanics and a diversity of game modes ave and player versus player versions of both draft and constructed play i cant recommend it enough if your a fan of cogs and doubly so if you re looking for a more strategic alternative to games like hearthstone my background i played hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale me as i moved onto duels and found i enjoyed the more complex board based game play but recent expansions have promoted flashy swing games with increasing amounts of ring i also tried other popular alternative cogs such as shadow verse and elder scrolls legends neither hooked me eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes feel like grinding gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the artificial intelligence for decent continuous rewards ladder shows greater diversity than games like hearthstone owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations draft is excellent featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards its an awesome way to build your collection as you get to keep the cards you draft this allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection especially as you re starting out while the diversity of game modes is what drew me in the rich game play is what has really hooked me mechanics such as echo when an echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand relic weapons hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically defender prescribed blocking and fast spells spells that can be played in response to an opponents actions including on their turn make for some deep strategic and interactive game play that is much more rewarding than the balkan forth nature of hearthstone the car based power mechanics reminiscent of magics lands makes deck building very flexible and multifaceted three action decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck at the same time mono action decks are quite variable with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire eternal meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than hearthstone team five but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned cogs live played the game is intensely free to play friendly in addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises packs provide twelve cards eight common three uncommon equivalent to a rare in hearthstone or duels and one rare epic or legendary gold level chests award packs and draft and forge draft versus the artificial intelligence also award chests at a runs completion all this is to say regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection live enjoyed eternal tremendously for its rich game play its hard to believe the game is still in beta future features like in client tournament modes and best out of three play will only further round out this already stellar game if you re a fan of card games especially deeper ones i cant recommend eternal strongly enough
early access review as a person with almost one thousands hours played i can tell this is a very nice game to play at a competitive level it can look like a smash copy but in fact it is a very different game its mechanics are so well done and you always have something new to learn this game should be more val rated
early access review run very smoothly not like that battle royal game cough no parachute land with superhero landing style different classes different skill and buff mount so a done have to walk all the time to get to the circle hope some of the animation got updated later when the game is full release dim looking forward for this game keep up the good work
first off it doesn't load into full screen that a huge let down not only that the controls feel very restricted the fighting system is virtually nonexistent and the story feels like a rip off from term or do

this game is alright and all but it seriously lacks some major points in a massively multiplayer online role playing game the karaoke content is too low and i cant even jam out to my favourites songs while slaying orcs please improve this game accordingly
its very fun if you know what you re doing i accident didst bring anything to heal my best dwellers when they went on a quest and they all died which made me quit it is fun for someone who has experience with it though
its a rather fun game but it could really use a much larger player base much of the battles you fight are meant to be on a grand scale but they done turn out too grand when there are only two people on each side
product received for free early access review remember when i played this game for the first time i thought it was cool that it had these new concepts that i learned thanks to my friend but this new update ruined all of that i was excited to get back into rob craft after at least a year of not playing it due to little mention from my friend but when i heard how sad and angry he was i new that the game me and him loved was gone i played the update for fifteen minutes and i already knew it want the same at all and the fact that they probably done listen to us makes it even worse id rate this game up if it were back to the good old times and sure i sucked at the game but my friend was great at it he spent maybe one hundred dollars on the game and now all a gets is crap please please if you are reading this if the creators are reading this fix this game thank you
early access review sorry but i cant tolerate card game that utilize power energy cards you lose too many games from either not getting any or from drawing way too many there already a significant amount of luck involved in card games and more luck makes them unbearable
only if you are a true dragons fan you will love this game like i do not every game has to be perfect i love flying around on my dragons and twenty five bucks to fly on toothless for three months hell yea they do need to update it with more quests tho laugh out loud its hard to level a new dragon after doing all the quests with your first one but all in all i absolutely love this game
i would download league of legends and spend one thousand in two minutes there than ever reinstall this trash game ever again men who play this game like to watch their wives girlfriends get smashed by other men i would write a detailed list of everything wrong with this game but i never read people long reviews either trust me this game is a waste of band with and mouse life the game is about as much fun as a visit to the doctor to get your std results
digital combat simulator has to be one of the best all round combat flight simulators covering aircraft from world war two all the way up to near current day aircraft soon to have more aircraft and scenery modules added to the already growing number of study aircraft this is far from an arcade simulation it takes time and effort on users part to even gain a basic level of competence if you have a good basic knowledge of flight and want to improve it further this is as great of a starting point that there is on steam skill in air combat is not needed to enjoy this simulation there are many pilots that fly strictly formation aerobatic free light situations on multiplayer servers i have great fun with friends and others live met while flying this sim online completion is out there on multiplayer if you want to be an ace the options are in the sim to go that route just be forewarned that there no such thing as ace in a day with this simulator in lucky to get one kill per session and there been many a day that the totals were zero but i still had a great time while engaged in digital combat simulator world i suggest that you try this on steam as it is free to play with two free aircraft included once you've decided to purchase modules it may be best to purchase directly from eagle dynamics as newer modules bought in steam wont transfer over to stand alone digital combat simulator world installed from eagle dynamics new modules take longer to get from stand alone version into steam release as well there more sales on at eagle dynamics web store than steam has there a lot to this sim as far as content goes and the future looks very bright for the next new modules that are coming down the pipe any way you cut it this is a great simulator and a ton of fun cha in the skies khyber mAy
i love this game but they have screwed it up so much it int funny do not spend a dime on it until it comes out of beat a changed the whole tiring system so now me fight mig fifteen all the time no german one hundred and nine does not over heat russian plans that were made in nineteen forty eights are in the same tier as us a brit japan nineteen fort threes year of ranking and i could go on game had all the hope you could possibly want finally a game that can burry that horrible thing called world of tanks but nash they went from a good company to ripping off the customer planes you buy get nerved real money they nerved the whole pay out system and made it almost impossible to play and yes i have premium a year of it to be honest i never end up with more deaths then kills every match yet i make jack crap in role play you make less in which was once called historical battle because you use to fight nation is nation but now they call it real battles or some bullshit play it but done spend a dime on it their russians and act like it bias to the hilt stalin was god us a and all eur players are treated like garbage so bad that if you buy gold its the same no conversion between dollars pounds and the euro but if your in mother russia they do the conversion on that pathetic money of theirs the rubble
bad game this is this game hacker bugs like eleven in match hackers clans are and there like nine bugs hackers meta sucks hackers round thirteen is a and dirty storage tie hacker card game mode is and like five hackers in a row that find happen
spent an hour walking around studying foot prints and droppings with seemingly no owner when i did eventually find an animal it was not the one i had been tracking and was informed i didst have the licence to shoot it given my newly screwed knowledge of focal matter from extensive steamer stalking i have sent my resume to the natural history museum offering my services as a professor for poop ology one thousand and ten would hunt turds again
fallout shelter logic evacuates everyone from another room to living quarters didst see there were a man and a woman five minutes later i realise i have two pregnant women would evacuate again
product received for free early access reviewer this is my first review so it is probably garbage and i probably use too many examples but tell me how i did here is a old version it is of to frustrating real quick payt haven controls oddly and bugs when you don to want it to needs to be flushed out more needs a catch up mechanic the loot crate system is total bullshit play with friends for three days with free premium then uninstall the game honestly only open this game if you can play nonstop with twenty three friends nonstop for the free premium length this game makes you laugh feel epic and you can really bond with friends with this game but it gets shallow quick here are the problems premium as you guess you need to pay for this it is a bit but you get a free three day trial when you offer up your email nothing too bad on the surface but you can see how it can get bad on the surface i climbed levels way faster than my friend who could to get premium to work you get more loot more on this later and the game just became easier you would have noticed free earlier it is paid and not always that good prices can get a bit expensive since you have to build your vehicle there are two limited factors your level cap and your parts you get twice as much paying and you level more so you can use all your shinny things quickly it handicaps the people that are free it is not pay town but more of a payt haven pamela honestly kinda loose at times but it is of as someone use to personal computer shooters the a and a rotating instead of moving is weird it can get into a lot of stumbling which is nothing something you want when someone sneaks up with a giant shotgun and is about to fire shooting though drove me nuts i really liked being a spider with two large rail guns and harass the flying people but when you are point at a plane coming at you it is shooting lasers and you line up a shot click and nothing it gets infuriating i zoom out to see that my rail gun as accident shot the ground or my arm or or they might have been shot off already or the worse thing ever is no reason now in the game they only let you get together with three friends if you are free or four if you are premium i thought it was strange until i realized why a good fun bit of the game is fighting in hectic chaos but when three friends get together they can just march to your base and wreck you this is why i suggest playing with friends when your base is getting assaulted you need to head back to make sure you don to lose then more enemies come and harass then more then more and you die and have to wait for sometimes over a minute to spawn defend die wait to re spawn and then watch your base explode you feel hopeless i feel two mechanics are at work one there is no catch up system so if you start losing chances are you are going to lose it feels like they take a page from heart stone and try to make your wins to losses this leads to your team face stomping when you do really nothing and you working your off to see everything fall apart no matter how good you play of and there is no reporting players so you get some cleaver cheaters loot system so my friend played this a while ago marco if you are reading this hi he told me of an age with cockpits in game currency and planes not sucking at controls he did to like the new loot system at all and i did to see why at first now i do does to matter if you are a free to play or paying you get displayed with loot you get and loot you would have gotten if you have paid after a game there are different tiers of loot crates and other reviews go into more detail but it sucks it is random someone can get a rare item in a silver crate while you get stuck with blocks and uncommon garbage in you diamond box you can grind up items you don to want into dust and forge new things you do want from the shop this is highway robbery at the exchanges they have when your team wins your score is doubled so you get better lot so often times the worse player on the wining team will get more and better stuff then the best player who happens to lose this can make a game where you got eleven kills two deaths and many assists to a bronze crate and that is lucky it is just still if you made it this far good for you i would give you all the stuff i got but no in game trading which is a smart move really but you can figure that out march
early access review this is overall a great game but it could be better try adding a more precise targeting system every time in fighting my pet blocks all my attacks when she teleport i done want to stop her from following me though also sometimes i try to mine small things like red mushrooms but i mine the block underneath instead understand this is not complete so in giving helpful feedback on how i think you can make it better
imagine battlefield but bigger six thousands players per server and up to two thousands on each continent persistent online war you can have up to three characters and there are three factions to choose from each faction has their own type of weapons and vehicles the game is very fun to play with friends and it is totally possible to play this game for free but if you do want to spend five dollars or something there are some downloadable content packs that give you more guns camps and it center it is a solid game and its free so you really done have much to lose when trying this out it is a solid game and a blast when you get some friends together
interesting game if you love big scale fights this might be for you though it takes a while to unlock weapons without buying cash there three factions in the game the terran republic van sovereign and the new conglomerate the gunplay is quite nice and vehicle combat is great every faction has its own strengths and weaknesses in both their guns and vehicles goal of the game is to capture all or as many base areas with your team as possible or complete the occasional global mission though there issues with the game mainly hacking in some servers is a big problem faction jumpers can be a problem too when one side starts losing everyone bails the ship and moves to the winning side and you start with the weaker guns or abilities for vehicles but if a can look past that and just enjoy the game its worth it its free to play so who cares if its bad i recommend trying it
early access review this game is free so why not five minutes later realise that footnote is also free quit of this game have a pretty good graphic but i died instantly to a chicken
early access review well supposedly live played this for five hundred and fifty even hours all i did was leave my laptop running for days on end i forgot about it anyways the game is fun because you get to build a robot and shoot other robots from what i gather from other reviews it has a pay to play feature which i highly dislike it takes a ton of time to get anywhere and you re paired with random people not at all in your skill set compared to what you've built unlocked so it could be a fun game but really its just frustrating
i have been really enjoying never winter and while i haven reached end game yet level sixty cap is seventy i do think this is an excellent game thus far made a note for a few points below pros combat system is the best live played in any massively multiplayer online so five term and wow free to play large variety of mount you can hire companions to fight alongside you pcs and outfit them you can earn zen market currency without spending any actual money lots of achievable goals via is only month is fifteen for wow or of guilds can own strongholds and can level up the stronghold for special benefits for their members health experience dec promotional events where cry ted studios or partners give away in game items conspires in the market seem a bit high for items ten for a twenty four slot bag loot low variety of loot seem to find the same looking loot constantly no set items haven seen any set items in level sixty i miss the variety of set items from wow levelling up goes by too fast hats all i got for now as far as levelling goes some people may enjoy levelling up quick personally it is too fast for me in almost to the level cap and there an incredible amount of areas i haven touched overall this is a very fun game thus far and in glad i picked it up highly recommend May
early access review its a free counter strike global offensive copy that made by russians and its pretty terrible but its also fun to waste your time and its extremely easy wouldn't recommend because you look like an idiot playing it because its a knock off counter strike global offensive its pretty fun i think it could have potential if the developers stopped copying counter strike global offensive maps and create some more original
early access review in my books close to perfect this game is honestly pretty damn amazing its free its produced by a good company who makes very realistic game environments and the engine its run on is absolutely stunning yea its obviously supposed to be a joke game all these people in the comments complaining about unbalanced weapons items done seem to understand the fact that this game is meant to be played as a joke as in you re supposed to actually have fun you shouldn't worry about winning or losing in this game i mean sure every single gamer in the world would agree that losing is not as fun as winning but in the end this game is an april fools joke that was built for the purpose of pure enjoyment and if you cant deal with losing in a mature manner then just get endnote to everyone complaining about gain net processes you agreed upon downloading the title that the game requires third party eula agreements and foreigner net to be installed and if you have such a huge issue with a third party program that has the purpose of updating your game then just disable it they included the option to do so on the launcher april

early access review every super smash bros player and fan should play this game awesome and really fun with great mechanics and it also supports different kind of controllers it works nice witch box three hundred and sixty game pad and also with log tech precision game pad a fast game play for having a great time with friends and other people really appreciated it
short review for a cute but short spooky horror game spooky house of jump scares is a indie first person walking simulator you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle after this you re given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game the game basically boils down to open door proceed through room open next door it gets old really really fast to keep things interesting the game throws some new enemy types which i honestly couldn't tell apart from the others and they spice things up with the rooms the biggest problem with this game is repetition i think somewhere around seven thousand and eighty of rooms are always empty and are basically the same its really boring to be honest and even the occasional jumps are wont impress you after you realise you spent thirty four hours pressing a to proceed in a horror game it had some interesting ideas to it but its just too boring to play i guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been of but he it still feels boring and bland to play its of for the first one thousand five hundred and twenty minutes but done expect much to change the good good audio decent atmosphere the bad lacklustre pamela repetitive rooms lack of variety overall boring four hundred and ten at best
early access review big ships big guns big explosions and lot of tactics all the ships are very different with very different roles and teamwork is the key to victory more than in any other mobs live been playing there are no builds or overpowered stuff for you everyone plays at about the same level individual skill int vital even if it helps teamwork teamwork teamwork nothing else and with this friendly community that really fun pros rookie friendly with a simple tutorial good matchmaking and progressive learning curve ships are very different from each others from the light fighter to the superheavy capital spaceship way more players since last free weekend from one hundred and fifty max a day to three thousands average not pay to win except cosmetic or early access starter pack you absolutely done need to pay to rule the galaxy not another mob the arena is nothing else than an asteroid field ships are really nice cons high pings can occur that can slow the game and can make it difficult to play i think its because there are a lot of people playing it now with the last update the tech tree is now larger and its harder to get the ship you really want to have in game movement and camera are hard to master shooting an enemy behind while fleeing will makes almost every time you hitting an asteroid and being struck in it maybe a watch behind key would help a bit we want even more ships i hope these will come for free and not as downloadable content great game overall do not hesitate to get it
at the first time this game is good until i got banned randomly with no reason like seriously no reason i didst do anything bad like cheat bot or whatever they can check my account if they want right but my point is they did not event reply my email about my problem like what the hell the costumer support do the if they didst even read my email at least give a reason why or whatnot just to me if a bad guy do something illegal you supposed to reply their email if they do or not i really want to give a thumbs up for this game seriously but after this accident seriously anyone can get random banned everyday man
early access review lets do it really short because i done wanna put too much time into reviewing a game that is pretty much still in development and has not too many complex features is this game an innovative battle royal well id say its a very fresh new touch to the variety of battle royal games that were released over the last two years or so it has some nice new mechanics start its and brings a very interesting zone mechanism with a unique endgame is this a good game ignoring the facts live listed above this game honestly needs some decent polishing before i would even bother commenting on the quality of the game in general there are some main issues de sync first person shooter some graphical glitches that will probably be worked on very soon its pretty much as good bad in terms of stability as pub and i obviously have to make this comparison with fewer first person shooter but less de sync and drops and the handling feels a bit smoother overall graphics are pretty neat same bad textures for some objects and terrains as in pub roe also has some really good vol features that certainly makes it a bit more casual than pub but also more enjoyable from my love a scope shaping auto attach etc is this a fun games yes snowboarding climbing zip lines paragliding its a lot of fun in terms of dynamic game play and movement over the map the gunplay is decent guns feel solid but recoil is pretty much absent you also got hit markers would i recommend this game yes its free and its more casual and more entertaining than pub mho so go ahead download it and give it a try you'll not regret it its especially enjoyable with friends gliding in a man squad or showing off your best sex snowboard moves while getting to the next zone closing words with some time and good decision making by ten cent games this will soon be a gem and probably overtake pubs daily player count on steam its like a mix of a casual pub and a more mature footnote without forts and with a lot of snow thanks for reading and have a lot of fun with roe
i learned how to swear in different languages am constantly angry whenever i hear spanish or russian being spoken have learned that there is a whole culture devoted to defense of the ancients two yentai also boobs would get
this game int worthy of my time anymore liked this once but the community just keeps getting more and more cancer which makes playing it just less fun for example i was once playing on a sniper server every time i killed someone they instantly insulted me even when i go pick on someone else then i get insulted by them and the game is starting to get more and more her in terms of economy it just int fun trading in team fortress two anymore heck for the sake of it i deleted my whole inventory and removed the game from my account not like it worked anyway but of either way this game is terrible
this game is like a giant puzzle every time i unlock new stuff i have to figure out how to put the pieces together to make things work i absolutely love it trying to figure out how to make demons work after ascension two was really interesting the normal things i pick that generally work for most factions didst work and i couldn't figure out why one night i sat there and tried a bunch of different builds and found something that had worked better than most other builds i used but i couldn't remember what i actually did afterwords this led me to invest a lot of time into the demon faction there so many little pieces you have to set up for them to work and when it works it works seeing a little titbit of info can make you think i wonder how this would interact with this other thing and you'll go off and test how to get it to work wonder what happens if i stack spell cost reduction on angels wonder what happens when i stack assistants with berserker on goblins wonder what happens if i try to get as much mana as possible on titans things like this have made me waste entire days away messing around with different builds in this game i cant play other idle games anymore this game is just a masterpiece
key so i got this game not long ago and it was really fun the combat the levelling it is all fun and kinda easy but the game is pay to win you might like reach someone who is pay to win but you will need like months or maybe years of farming and to make gear like his or buy it in auction player versus player on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not you are in player versus player with a power and the other guy is there with twenty even a power that like totally to so pay to win game i suggest you not to waste time in this game unless a are willing to spend money on this game cut player versus player is unbalanced and even ave when they have paid stuff they do hell of dps i would rate five hundred and ten
a great game the time fade away in an indescribable music as we craft to build our world very nice ambient where some evil creatures came at night to disturb this peaceful world
as a payer with over two thousands hours in this game i think its fair to say i like it why pros one the cartoonish style of the game allows for all sorts of cool and interesting game mechanics such as teleworkers the game is still receiving new weapons cosmetics maps and bug fixes even though it was released in twenty thousand and seventy three there an enormous amount of customization and in not just talking about your player you can change the had and many other aspects of the game there are a million ways to play the game using different weapons in your load out can drastically alter the game itself if you know how to use them there is a whole trading economy trading and selling items can literally be a game itself and many people play the game for that reason the community surrounding this game is large and vibrant tired of the same old maps there are plenty of community hosted servers that play on fun and unique maps there have even been official updates to the game that have completely made of community made items and maps there really is no other developer that works and listens to its community quite like valve there really a rent many hackers you'll see one if you play the game long enough but you can go months without seeing one its free cons one no real single player mode there is an offline mode with bots and its good for practice but that it there no campaign and the only story is in comics from the official web site which are a good read there is a huge learning curve it will take you a long time to learn about all the different weapons and how to use them or where to place your buildings as an engineer or how that spy killed you after you killed him new players and or players that a rent really familiar with the game are hated with a passion and since it can take a while to learn the game you can expect some hate for quite some time its not a good game for casual gamers because of cons two thirty five the few hackers that play the game and there really a rent any at all are extremely hard to get rid of they change their name to avoid vote kicks ans spam the chat and are very annoying to play against but as i said in the pros hackers are few and far between and you can always join another server
race room downloadable content downloadable content that only includes cars downloadable content that only includes some cars and some tracks downloadable content that only includes a certain championship with its cars tracks and season features this is the downloadable content only visible in steam then there is downloadable content only visible in the game and its own store the store makes special offers that save you money in the store you can also pay for each car and each track this price policy is my reason to not recommend race room i cant put a customized race room game together that fits my needs and is worth the money at the end of the day this is a terrible business model remember ten years ago you could buy for less money a full racing game with more content than this cash grab and its whole downloadable content content
early access review lives in australia clicks asia five hundred ping gets into game is playable sort of ques for next match cant find one tries later still cant find a match take my money best clicker live played
early access review here were some initial launch issues but once the loading screen bug was fixed were played without issues i really like this game and am still having a blast in it there are a lot of people slamming this game right now and it doesn't deserve it be wiz is doing a great job so far as well very pretty engaging game
so in leaving a review here in reps once to just now this game going live what all the rob craft vets are saying is sadly very true to an embarrassing degree its pay to win in so many ways its basically not a free to play to make matters worse they removed pretty much everything that made this game good played this game back where pilot seats and such were a thing just like these veterans i just didst tolerate the to this game turned into we all saw this coming and its absolutely the case if anyone is reading this and interested in the game i suggest you look into like a orion or star made or hell maybe evening rob lox or something just something that int this game
early access review phenomenal once again artie entertainment has brought a completely original and engaging game to life i honestly done know what i enjoy more the team members or the game its self despite being in beta its already chock full of content there a bit more to be done but that to be expected i have yet to see another company that can live up to its promises and then some keep going guys you re doing great
new edit at after changes during seven hundred onward the game did come out of the issues previously stated however there still some major issues that has and never will apparently be addressed properly one alt smurf troll it center accounts even after the add your phone system there has been no change in the amount of clear alt and troll accounts on the contrary after turbo mode was introduced it seems the old ranked mode is even more filled with people who should just be permanently banned script is issue that is not widely screamed about but is there on this issue i have no idea how well valve is hunting them down and how common it really is what i do know is that you sometimes stumble on players abusing scripts and the only way to really know is to watch and analyse the replay overall toxic behavior that will never disappear as long as alt accounts are possible there are just so many players that a rent just abusive in chat they intentionally destroy games for the entire team didst get mid well ill just sit in base and get one hundred experience points every five minutes from jungle and then sit in base watching youtube again or ill just buy all wards and place them in our fountain because of reason a after the talent introduction i feel the game has gone in a downward spiral in terms of balance there has never been so clear meta than after seven hundred every patch there are heroes with insane win rates on all mar ranges have to say that in always thought data as the best mob out there in terms of game play and the insanely high skill cap a much of that remains now that seven hundred came out but in the mean while the guy is to the point that the game doesn't feel right anymore however the issue int only the guy a major issue is the new map limo suddenly the map became a super open world that doesn't have the same boundaries it used to have there just way too many ways to invade opposing side of the map making the world feel like its an open arena instead of radiant and dire side i have to say that my first impressions on the new patch is leaving me with the feeling that i done wanna play defense of the ancients two anymore at all edit seventh of feb after some user interface fixes the game has started to look like data again however during these new updates things have gone in other ways a lot worse after some changes to the match making system and report system there has been a significant raise in unjustified low priority games you can get low priority for anything now example muted after three games of summary showing three didst say a word during those games won one lost two after which a four game win streak still muted and receive three games in low priority problem is that opponents are able to report you if you play certain heroes you will farm reports like there no tomorrow i kinda have to say in starting to feel in finally done with this game for good and wont put any more money into it
early access review used to like this game until the last update it started to go downhill on the previous update with the unbalanced weapons read ion distorted now all that made rob craft great and a good progression getting better and better items has now been undone and were left with a gamble at the end of each match it used to be really something to get a bonus of role play the item currency before robots when winning now its a random grind i actually put real money into this and was somewhat annoyed when the higher level stuff i bought got turned into role play or made obsolete by the previous update i can no longer recommend the game to others like live done in the past pity that free am decided to ruin things
either you play against a level one that can not summon more than eight hundred attack and def cards or you play against bots that wreck you in two turns no matter what only three play fields instead of five and no more than four thousands up which kills you in two turns i have to play against bots in auto duel why is that a thing to farm or you know i uninstall this
hated is a really cool setting which i really love then you got a game based on that setting how can you go wrong well the look graphics a rent everything for sure but this game was released in twenty fourteen and it looks like something made like ten years ago compare this with another massively multiplayer online such as final fantasy fourteen released four years prior to school of dragons and boy does it look better limitations of course this is a free to play game so it lives of micro transactions and paying memberships which are optional to unlock stuff you need to buy gems which serve as in game currency but is it really necessary to actually charge gems if you want to delete a character of and you can only have one character unless you purchase additional slots dragons in the beginning you get to choose which dragon you want the dragon only follows you around and when its grown up you can ride it i have no idea if that only for looks or if the dragons actually have different skill sets as a nonpaying player you get to choose from four dragons four so i guess the paying member gets a much larger variety right i couldn't check because i didst have enough gems to delete my character and start a new one but if i remember correctly a paying member gets an additional two dragons to choose from and no the nightshade is not one of them why not offer more variety also when choosing your dragon there are a few options for customization like color they done seem to work at least i couldn't change them maybe i chose a dragon that cannot be customized or i need to be a paying member to do so the controls of boy so moving around on the ground is easy enough if a bit stiff you cant look around while moving but at least you can control the characters orientation with the mouse in flight that a different story you control the flying direction solely with the keyboard the steering feels very slippery and you constantly have to steer and counter steer to keep the dragon on track as it keeps turning for a while longer after you released the button climb and dive angles are limited some flight school courses actually required you to do a steeper dive or climb than is actually possible seriously why not allow steering the dragon with the mouse you could then use was for strafing also attacking or using skills in flight is terrible you actually have to click on the skills to use them you re in flight trying to quickly attack something first you must look and make sure the cursor is placed above the button loading time every time you change to another area you get a loading screen which is of course used as a canvas for advertising at times the game made me feel like i was walking through a forest of billboards setting there hardly are any settings to speak of you can toggle sound and music on and off but you cant adjust the volume you can look at the key mapping but you cant edit it you can choose to invert the vertical axis in flight which is a good thing at least you can toggle wether names are displayed above yourself and other players and you can toggle solo and massively multiplayer online mode that it summary you can see that i didst play very long i probably didst even get to see the main game but seriously what i saw was enough i cant say it was fun the game appears half arsed and unfinished it looks rushed and like the deus didst care for it at all and considering the large amount of stuff i was already expected to pay for before i actually started my first mission if that the sign of whats to come no thanks do i actually have anything positive to say us the dialog have partial voiceover which is nice and some areas are nicely designed despite the outdated graphics jump start hated is a great movie which you could have turned into a great game you choose not to you choose to make this a half arsed thing that begs for money at any given opportunity but it doesn't offer anything i would be willing to pay money for what a waste
i honestly wish i found this game sooner not only is this dial style game better than actual diabolo it has amazing mechanics i have never seen before in any game the orb currency system is an amazing alternative to a gold system skill gems are an amazing way to customize skills to make them perfect my only problem with the game is that the micro transactions are not so micro almost fifty for a pack of arm or skins its a little expensive but hardcore as in heavy not single life players would do it to support the company
early access review game is legit so much fun and its only in beta look forward for future updates definitely a game you should get specially if you re into super smash bros as its similar yet has its own unique element
the card draws are absolutely not random maybe ninety five of my losses live had turn out like this no possible moves for the first three turns playing catch up and hoping i stop drawing either duplicates of multiple cards i cant use for six turns or only drawing exact same type of cards i done need in one match by turn two i literally drew five of my six item cards in the beginning of a match with no one to equip them then after surviving the ensuing slaughter with less than ten health stage a miraculous comeback chain around ten cards together and while out most of the opponents board only to have my opponent randomly draw precisely what they need to win that turn being defeated with two full lanes after starting with a worthless hand is antithetical to a good game i done know if its an attempt to keep we ratios even which is at mechanic anywhere but from the beginning of many matches its clear who legends has picked to win in those situations live only come out on top twice both times because my opponent made a fatal mistake deck based card games never have decent ring this one is no different
i give this game fifty five for being the one best game at displaying how quick micro transaction based economies can ruin a title the game play itself is almost zen like in its approach until they sit you down and make you realize to play further you have to learn how to assemble and disassemble a firearm from start to finish without a single error error here meaning an arbitrary order with no real world reason for it being like that its a real shame that they decided to try and milk the community for all its worth pro great detail to the variety of weapons great way to learn how your own personal firearm heavy is given so haphazardly that they clearly want you to buy packs rather than grind they offer twenty thousand experience and twenty credits to you if you'll advert the game and get five other players to play recommendation save yourself some time and save money for a real pistol then learn how to assemble disassemble it via a video you get a better experience
though this game is nowhere near as good as it once was back in twenty million one hundred and forty two thousand and fifteen id say its still a decent game as long as you can ignore the obvious milking of the mobile apps industry cash grabs for app store user first off id recommend personal computer wot but the nice thing about blitz is its very easy to run even the weakest of pcs can run this game fine i have a core two duo a and no dedicated graphics and i can play at low settings with four thousand and sixty first person shooter for those who done speak techy which is weird since you re playing on a personal computer i can play this game with a processor from two thousand and fives and no dedicated graphics card any thing even remotely modern can easily run this game second off its easier than the standard wot a means that if you even have twelve a brain and use some situational awareness you can have relatively easy success in battle finally its just a fun game in general its free obviously there gonna be micro transactions but looking past that its a great way to pass time
hi again everyone happy steam sale its time for another review war thunder is another entry in the world war two battle est category and its a vehicular version of first person shooter game play featuring player operable planes and some tanks that is sure to satisfy some fans of the genre i haven had the opportunity to sample everything the game has to offer but live sampled it enough to give a good basic review and endorsement based upon the fun hours live spent in the game so what are the particulars pick a major player from world war two axis or allies grab a plane and fight or alternatively grab either a russian or german armoured ground unit and go to work at the present it appears that ground and air games are completely separated with the alternate form of fighting handled by artificial intelligence in either game you get some very basic gear to start off with at tier one and work your way up the ladder your achievements in game translate into research points for upgrades as you go your upgrades increase your ability to survive and achieve more as you play you easily earn enough unless things change to purchase better planes and gear without spending real cash there an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode live spent nearly all of my time in arcade and that plenty of fun i will leave the review of realistic and sim modes to someone with much more experience with those therefore please assume my comments are mostly based upon my experiences with arcade the good a lot there a lot to like about this game even if its a bit femme for some what it does right is astoundingly good i think its beautiful play on three monitor surround if you can add joystick and throttle if you like game pads anyone or just wing it with a single monitor and mouse the developers aimed to give you many options with this one and it fulfill many of my gaming sim desires involving planes world war two and lovely landscapes there an arcade mode a realistic mode and a simulator mode live played many games that attempted to straddle the line between simulator and arcade game and as a result live logged numerous hours attempting to keep my planes under control while trying to find and engage a distant speck in the sky in war thunders arcade mode you get some level of realism mixed with tons of action action action freedom of choice and strong competition make this game a winner with a large selection of aircraft most of which you must earn or into which you may pay your way a vibrant at this time player community on personal computer and playstation four make wait times for battle very low the matchmaking is somewhat good because you get placed into a group based upon your skills and gear the pay to win aspect is somewhat mitigated by this because while you can pay your way ahead you can only pay your way so far beyond your peers before you place yourself in a completely different rank of competition skill and brains are required regardless of your gear and this is a good thing because iron sharpens iron as they say the bad i find there a serious lack of balance in the game not everyone will agree of course but if you play the starting planes of all nations you can feel the difference some will argue that this reflects the reality of varying levels of tech at the start of the war but i disagree the soviet aircraft and tanks always feel overpowered both on the giving and on the receiving ends i cant tell you how many aircraft live been shot down in by players in soviet planes i once flew a large bomber which had its tail severed with one blow from a soviet biplane rockets maybe one shot lucky hmm in not sure live had wings cut off by soviet fighters like they were made of brittle paper in this game for manoeuvrability its hard to beat the soviet biplanes for sheer kicker its hard to beat their fighters which appear to destroy anything that gets too close to their sights in tank games which only allow german and russian vehicles at this time the russian tanks feel somehow tougher to me the tank gun sights turn color depending on how likely your round is to pierce enemy arm or at the point of aim green for best chance of damage yellow for middling and red for lowest chance at damage comparing tank for tank live had trouble damaging opponents while using german tanks and a green crosshair while at the same time destroying opponents in one shot using a russian tank with a red crosshair if you fly british or japanese beginning fighters and the russian beginning fighters on the same day for the first time after you re experienced with the mechanics of the game just as i did before writing this review you can feel the difference in the aircraft for each nation the russian aircraft felt better were more manoeuvrable and i scored more hits kills and assists with those than i did with any other nations aircraft at that time for that level crews being completely new and all other elements somewhat equal foreigner is russian i suppose that says all that needs to be said and live had issues with foreigner over their moderation in other games in the past take it for what its worth its one informed opinion you re entitled to your own which i hope you will develop on your own by playing this game regardless some might claim that the russian aircraft were just that good but i offer you this quote from wikipedia by one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight the soviet union had the largest air force in the world but soviet aeronautical design was distinctly lagging behind western technological advances instead of focusing on developing tactical aircraft the soviets engineers developed heavy bomber planes only good for long distance in other words planes that would be used for record breaking flights like those of chaos the soviet governments focus on showy stunts and phenomenal record breaking missions drained resources needed for soviet defense when nazi germany attacked the soviet union in june it quickly became apparent that the soviet air force was not prepared for war happen wikipedia june twenty the ugly i only have two complaints and then ill move on first done make any statements in chat that anyone might find remotely disagreeable because the community has a good number of loudmouth jerk trolls even if you say nothing chances are good that you'll read something hilariously asinine while playing if you play for a bit a few idiots like to to and in that respect its no different from any first person shooter second you re going to get bottled just accept that fact quietly and move on when it happens try to open the scoreboard click the name of the person who did it and report them for betting its made inconvenient on purpose so fewer people will file complaints especially false ones in my experience if you say anything about it in chat you will catch flak from some jerk seriously if someone gets lucky that not an issue for me if someone is shooting at me for any length of time and they hit my pilot that in general is fine but heres my experience of what is happening for your consideration scenario one in flying along i hear battle royal less than a second of gun sound and my pilot is knocked unconscious on replay i watch a guy fly into position shoot a couple of rounds if that and fly away immediately after all of that adds up to bot in my mind scenario two in flying along in a bomber same thing happens one guy simply turned off my engines just that fast without any apparent damage otherwise most often however my pilot is just knocked out my thing is this if they shoot me through my plane wouldn't the rounds have hit something on the way in thus doing damage to the plane as well as knocking my pilot unconscious a few scenarios present themselves saying that it could happen otherwise but i find it happens all too often may
uses peer exchange by default to download updates is auto blacklists me every time i try to play since torrents use the same connection to download files you can turn this off but a game this popular should use its own dedicated download servers by default not a peer exchange system i shouldn't need to boot up van software just to be able to play this game to turn off peer exchange otherwise light pay town mechanics in an otherwise very fun game
well if you broke up with your girlfriend and having pain start playing this game you will face with drunks and russians and that makes you cancer so that cancer will make your pains end shortly
i used to play the game card when i was a kid thanks to kenai they are bringing back the good memories i have this game in my iphone and i play it everyday and it feels amazing also the game has a lot of spell rap cards and each card does an effect build your deck with your strategy and have fun i recommend this game
early access review really fun to play in before now but still done know why people are still but hurt about the malware this is how you uninstall it how to remove foreigner agent the agent is not malware as some very uninformed individuals here claim with absolutely no evidence to support their case it is nothing but disinformation the agent acts very much like a number of software update programs even your operating system and anti virus software does this to remove it for windows seven open a command line press win or click on the start button and use the search line enter macon fig eye into the text box in the system configuration tool go to the startup tab and disable a check the foreigner net agent on win ten open the task manager select the startup tab and disable the foreigner net agent shut down the foreigner net agent in the system tray right click to get the exit option if you want to completely remove the agent you need to go to the following folder and delete it capita folder can be hidden in some installations tips support foreigner if you remove it do not then moan and complain about long downloads it center when a major update of the game is released this is one of the things the agent minimizes
product received for free early access review this game was good until they added epic lot update before i had likely points but now in only have seventy one think they did be case users should buy items for real money and the prices on items are the same done donate this game suck ten
if you haven played this game yet in surprised if you like realistic two thousands player battles set in a time where giant mech suits and force fields exist you'll like this side note you'll need a pretty good computer mine int sufficient
early access review the game had some really bad issues at the launch that didst allowed me and many players to play but we overlooked it we insisted on it didst refund it cause we really wanted to play with our friends we kinda wanted to believe things would get better anyway i done like player versus player but i follow my friends around i absolutely love ave content i also hate slow ave that thing where you take forty five seconds to kill a single simple monster i done mind long boss fights i kept playing bless because its ave was fast i done have patience for boring fights cause it makes me literally sleep in my chair and that what the deus made in this last patch as soon as the auto refunds were turned off i done recommend it for anyone that dislikes super slow paced ave content and probably player versus player too so yeah i might change my review in the future but i needed to express my discontent somehow
early access review kinda have the feeling that this games developer is a salty magic player this game has a bad ruling fast spells doesn't recognize whats called player turn priority also seventy five cards in a deck that too many even standard magic only has sixty cards even the mulligan is worse than magic the good thing bout this game is you can play for free by grinding in gauntlet also the arena draft is kinda interesting us you get to collect what you draft
early access review downloads game because friend likes this game plays sniper mode accidentally equips the wrong load out so you only get a knife gets twenty even kills in that round gets second place for most kills in that same round first place having three hundred and nineteen thousand five hundred and ten would kill a sniper with a knife again
early access review my review of he where do i start this game has changed a lot since i last played it this game has turned for the better the user interface looks nicer as well as the matchmaker is better and when i came back to the game i was greeted with a crap load of credits diamonds and a veteran membership if your an old player of this game who got bored or fed up of the game its worth getting back to it did i section that the grinding is a tad bit better
early access review this game is broken bad combat system server disconnects awful video lag it center the company knew it was broken and took our money anyway thieves also this is the last game i buy on steam because no refund despite the game being misrepresented shame on all of you involved
early access review first thing i want to say is live had this game for over a year i bought the harbinger pack and a few thousand platinum a good two thousand five hundred and thirty dollars i enjoy it tremendously in at nearly three hundred hours as you can see cd and i must say every second was enjoyable also stunned by the amount of progress this game has made amazing graphics love the blend of first person shooter and strategy this game offers gay not good at long reviews here are some things i like graphics lovely such graphic the community best community ever i mean it the fact that i get to talk to developers and be listened to zero it makes me feel special all probably done remember me hama the team play aspect much wow many friend graphics amazing the constant addition of new ships and features i disappeared for a month or two and i swear they've changed the logo and added like six new ships plus other really cool features awesome graphics the fact that i can run it on my owed pentium thirty two fifty eights forty four gigahertz for you nosey people and titi on high ultra settings many fuses wow graphics did i mention the graphics things i done like the fact that i can only play an hour or so a day much bummer the lack of steam achievements they would be so cool the occasional crashes keep in mind it is still a fairly new game i still love it such review such words much wow dogma maps join the doge army ups we have cookies apps such cookie many yum
early access review stay away from this game an absolutely horrible start day one got stuck with the loading screen bug i had to restart my game about sixteen times each time i crashed the game had horrible optimization in some areas duplication bug destroy the economy in one day i got forced to join one server then they locked it and added new servers so my five friends were not able to join me they wanted me to pay girl money to warp to a dungeon another fun part about dungeons is people spawn kill you as you leave it day two more of the same crap day three my ranger made it to fort five and five all my gear and got one shot by a level thirty mage player day four went to a level twenty eight ave area and farmed items to level my gear day five they nerved all classes and me and my level fort five mage friend were having trouble killing a level twenty eight mini boss we would do six combo attacks and it barely touched the health of the mob something i was farming before that took six hits to kill now takes two players around twenty hits i try to get a refund but no luck stay away from this game
walking around secluded area while searching for loot hoping meeting humans for survival got shot before even able to chat or talk what a community this game not recommended to play truly waste of time been walking without knowing what to do worst
early access review guys whf done buy this game until they fixed all the bugs refund this garbage game and wait till its all fixed i cant recommend this game loading screen freeze first person shooter drops first person shooter low as with a high end personal computer to few servers for eur form incoming
early access review re command this game because awesome fights you will not get bored ann and is very funny be got smashed by a hammer and kicked away of the screen with a single punch i will get punched again
i know i have almost one thousands hours in this game and its because i am too deeply entrenched to leave it i am a sad do so i could get through the horrific grind for items that are compared to other factions i play as soviets game is unbalanced and broken atm however it has lots of potential this is the only combined arms game i know come back in ten years see where its at but for now stay away from this cesspool
so the thing about this is that the community is full of bags and you cant get any straight answers to your questions like ever there no proper tutorial which should tell you how to figure shirt out on your own and basic pretty important stuff like basic shiite game mechanics or even something as simple as checking your own fucking experience on any single character its pretty fun to muddle through because you done really have to know anything to keep on playing but if you get frustrated easily you should avoid this horse rap like the plague
early access review wish the reviews had a neutral option the game has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be the top collectible card game it by far has the best single player artificial intelligence of any game in the genre there is a very fun and free single player mode is the artificial intelligence that gives you lots of cards gold they are very generous and make the collection building much easier than other games the ranked system is actually very well done you need one hundred points to rank up and every win gives you some points and a loss takes some away you gain more points for wins than points loss for losing i have a few key issues with this game which is the main reason i only really play to do daily quest now and instead play elder scrolls legends with most of my time elder scrolls legends is by far the bes collectible card game available and its a shame nobody has heard of its kind of funny that dire wolf is also doing elder scrolls but yet that game blows away eternal anyway lets get into the actual problem the decks are just too large with seventy cards but they do allow for up to four copies of each card carrying four copies of each with seventy cards is not the same as having a thirty five card deck with two copies of each your extra copies or even all of the copies of one card can and often do end up in the latter ads of the deck which never see play there are just too many total cards to be able to have very consistent game play i have spent a little over half of my time playing ranked matches and i have had only a couple of games that actually felt like good solid games on both sides just for a comparison elder scrolls has almost every game feel like a good close game with the winner being determined based on skill more than ring the other ninety nine of games were just blowout wins or losses too often the game is decided in the opening hand whoever wins or loses is more often a question of which player gets a better distribution of their vigils rather than who actually played better or had a better constructed deck you put fifty cards into the deck and then you are forced to put at least twenty five sigil cards if you want to play a one cost unit then you must first play one sigil to play a two cost unit requires you to have played two total vigils and you can only play one sigil per turn in theory this is a good idea but their system needs some serious tweaking to make the game play feel balanced ninety of the games end with fifty cards left into the deck too often you will have cards in your hand but then cant play them because you draw a sigil for six turns in a row the other thing that happens is that you only draw minions spells but no vigils i hate winning a game for no reason other than my opponent drew vigils for six straight turns while i bashed his face in i also equally hate losing for this same reason the mulligan system will allow you to either keep or replace all of your cards which does not help these things from happening if the developers will fix the sigil issue and cut the size of the deck by about ten cards then would be a perfect game the way the game is right now i would recommend it if you like magic as its really close in game play or hate the other cogs you re currently playing you would be better off checking out elder scrolls legends because until this game is more balanced est is just a better game all around
early access review the new reward system has ruined the game in its entirety getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept but there are multiple issues with this it removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck it encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates i a getting points from capping towers that are almost capped is far greater than doing it yourself the item sell values make it near impossible to actually acquire items from the shop without massive amounts of grinding premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want the premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept but showing the players what they missed out on because they didst put money into your game even if they have in past and got burned on it because of the recent changes is just cruel i played this game for a while before the recent overhaul had quite a few mightier blocks and mightier weapons the former of which cost quite a lot of in game currency only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player meaning the amount of time i spend prior to the change was completely pointless save for acquiring levels translating to more cup in summary the recent overhaul screwed over a number players myself included the only progression available is that of pot luck and has never been more pay town with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legend aires more readily available in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want far sooner than normal players

its awesome it is even better than diabolo three and its even for free and definitely the first free game i really like cant believe they making a game like this for free but a can buy in game items and stuff with real money if you want to
played the game on bethesda launcher before it was released on steam finished the free single player campaign but never player player versus player it felt like a mixture of magic and hearthstone the deck construction is like magic where you can mix up to two classes of cards while the battle system is like hearthstone where magic a like mana crystal in is grows up by one each turn and how attack works there are also supports and items which are pretty much similar to the artefacts and equipment in magic creature abilities are basically a sum of both games summon battle cry guard taunt breakthrough trample last grasp death rattle lethal poison drain lifeline pilfer regenerate it center it does introduces something new in this game mainly the two lane system where each lane is its own battle ground so you'll have to be more tactic about distributing your creature cards on the field also the special rules of each lane stealth like right lane and level specific left lane makes it worthwhile to consider which lane you want to lay down your card in a way its a reinvention of magics flying creature mechanism there also the rune system which acts like secret from is that let you draw one card when losing certain amount of health there are cards that interact specifically with such mechanism second go player are quite compensated with jewel rings that are like the extra coin in is but you can use it three times i have to agree with what others said about the balancing i feel that the three uses of jewel for second go is a bit too much but at least its not completely unplayable for first go player also in not a hug fan of card minimum requirement for deck construction this makes it extremely hard for beginners to build decent decks that done contain filler cards which essentially lower your chance of draw combo cards overall i still think this is definitely a game worth playing you can play through a quite lengthy campaign for free and unlock others with in game currency that you earn there even a solo arena mode like in is but you play against artificial intelligence great for ave players like me i think it finds a balance between the casual side of is simpler rules and faster pace and the hardcore side of magic creature abilities deck construction its a game you done have to heavily invest your time in you can simply pick up and leave any time when you have around min to spare good for killing time it would however be even better if its brought to mobile device which i think its going to happen for even better access to game its very light on hardware and friendly to touchscreen i would simply keep the game installed so that you can play it while waiting for a class to begin or having a coffee at starbucks
i would have recommended this game two years ago now there are about eighty less players than what it was and it takes ages to find a match and if you do your ping is probably really bad as well as that the germans are overpowered sadly this is the end of this beloved game
really bad its a poor day clone user interface is terrible the worst cant start a game with friends there is too much randomness to things in game the game modes done add much game play and done have any goals limo stay away
a pretty cool sandbox survival game the inspiration in min craft is obvious but i am very glad it didst just stay there and changed in many ways from there the crafting system could be slightly better maybe all recipes that just require you to have something could be unlocked from the start except those that require finding the recipe but i understand the intention of keeping it simple for new players the other cool thing is how easy it is to invite other players to play with you since the game is entirely cloud based my only reservation is in the fact that you cannot play the game at all while offline but well what do i expect from an otherwise pretty great free to play game
not for the faint of heart of patience but if you enjoy diabetes que gear grinders this will definitely scratch that itch be prepared to understand nothing and feel a bit overwhelmed by the passive tree id recommend picking a build from a site like tim tips and following it for your first character since there no sort of tutorial and its very difficult to undo large mistakes made during levelling once you've played a character through the first couple difficulties you will likely understand what you do and done like about it and be able to better build a new one despite being a free to play it is not a pay to win all things in the premium shop are either cosmetic or quality of life items but nothing is required if you re like me and waiting for diabolo three to do something meaningful path of exile can help fill the void

its an awesome game but very hard for newcomers after a while though its the most rewarding first person shooter out there there is no other game like it i advise everyone to visit planet side two sub edit to look for help in how to learn this game to make your experience easier and more fun you can also ask people in game they are incredibly helpful
highly competitive shooter for try ards make no mistake on that valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is its not easy to pick up if you re new to quake like shooters you better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you or you might get frustrated by some things public player versus player and ave known as man versus machine in team fortress two servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned if you done want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun sweaty competitive try ards will really see where this game shines though well balanced competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathwatch ability to a real test despite valve overlooking the competitive format multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level if you want to do team based sports look no further than team fortress two this game has more competitive spirit in it than laugh out loud and data combined as for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age thanks to its stylised look some items from content updates are very much out of the games theme though which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is the game is poorly optimised in some instances too especially man versus machine but that can be solved by first person shooter boosting co figs all in all in good
early access review love this game live played magic since second grade and this is the first time i feel like there is a another collectible card game worth my time pros you done need to constantly spend money you play to earn your cards i think this is the most fun part of the game it would be much less fun if they just handed you all the cards although you'll probably want to spend some money to keep this game going drafting is awesome you draft four packs and keep every card you draft as well as prizes depending on how you do standard meta feels very balanced nothing feels broken so many different deck types that are competitive you can win one pack each day for winning a casual or ranked match as well as new quests every day to earn in game gold i usually have more than enough gold to draft anytime i want to cons art style is a little cheesy had to think of something of and the story line in the campaigns is super dumb
early access review this game is basically unplayable for me i play counter strike go with twelve hundreds dpi and one hundred and six in game sensitivity but war mode just doesn't have the options that counter strike go has also there are more russians on here than on counter strike go especially ones who done speak english but the best way to play this game is by uninstalling it i had a thirty kill streak with no deaths after uninstalling and now in top of the leader board
i got banned for no reason left the game and then tried to reconnect it said disconnected and it crashed then said your are banned for exploiting or cheating in ban me did nothing
early access review this is like a cross of counter strike global offensive and cod but people are not as toxic right now we got a boat load of goodies for the one year anniversary so you done have to buy everything high fingers get kicked out automatically lots of weapons to play with but they only offer few maps better hit reg that cod best of all you done feel like someone robbed you in three months when the hype of the new cod wears out
early access review not like pub has its own twist to it edit needs some updates and to developers why done you post whats being updated on the game you didst post any of the updates and its been updated four times since release why also i heard a few pal saying this game installs malware is it true
early access reviewed is fun but it has too less game mods and at one point you will get bored to do the same thing with the same weapons not that its hard to get weapons but they feel very similar events are also nice
with each and every update this game just keeps getting better and better are competes on every level with any a a title released to date this game in my opinion is fast becoming a work of art graphically and technically are has exceeded all my expectations and cannot be overlooked by any sim racer the driving experience is very realistic and suited to players of all levels the user interface is particularly nice and offers everything you could possibly think you want options are really well laid out in a manner which suits the whole presentation package perfectly a lot of work and thought has went into this title and anyone who loves attention to detail will no doubt agree this is one of the very best sim racers available on personal computer if not the best are also has some of the best force feed back and force feedback options i have experienced in any racing title simply awesome one thousand and ten a must have sim
early access review well this is a good space three dimensional shooter mob game thumbs up space styled stunning graphics obj up now no ping matter equalized ships tech line triple tree load outs downside prolonged unique army hull hard to learn some ships slightly imaginal rate improvement expected because it still in alpha and already feels like completer commanded to download for free on the store captain we got a hole in technique interest strep loading fixed entree gone and all ships are open for direct rundown starting to lagged a bit orwell mate i got myself disconnected twice from a game when its about to finish and i cant reconnected hope they can fix the pings between servers or in resigning
unplayable the menu here is full of bullshit when you go to the play button in game you can go and play right well when you go to the only game mode you can go to since you re a newbie it has the fleet customization tab pop up and there nothing you can do to fix it fleets tab gets in your way so you cannot press anything this is a game breaking bug after about four restarts on the game it loads the play button in that a lot of reloading then there the really constant appearance of the one negative one you cant buy any of the components needed to get to the tier two items but restarting will fix it good game but my thumbs down indicate a bug fix needed
luckily heroes and generals is a free game the footage of the game and what you have seen of it before is often very misleading while larger battles with vehicles and forty people can be fun you need to unlock the ability to fight in these by ranking up the process would be fine if the game was entirely functional and complete it int the gunplay is clunky and forced and everything about movement and aiming feels very unnatural its a mix between the camera being too slow as well as lacking accuracy i a the camera feeling de synced from your mouse and aiming at moving targets becomes a challenge in its own right you'll often find a close quarters engagement often turns into who can empty their magazine first and hope to hit something and even then a regular firefight gives no sense that you are actually hitting anything furthermore even on maximum settings the game looks very graphically unpolished the resolution and application of textures is poor and the fax might as well not be there because at best it actually detracts from the game live seen rob lox projects with better blood effects perhaps the largest issue with this game is the lack of player base getting into a normal match usually takes upwards of five minutes if not ten or more the game might be a bit more fun if you were in a match faster but the game play is absolutely not with the waste of time i would give the game a five hundred and ten nothing about the game is debilitating awful just poorly made or downright underdone
early access review while i do agree the grind is about as repetitive as you can get and the overwhelming push to get you to spend money is a bit much its still an otherwise enjoyable game i enjoy playing it when i need essentially a time killer
product received for free its a great game involving strategy trial and error and fun competitions and hackers yep wonderful hackers in the competitions steal your well earns medallions until the hacking is fixed its not as fun
this game is amazing i have put many hours into it one hundred on steam and many more on the website i have been playing it ever since it came out dec just bought this game from kab am and is updating it so far they are communicating with the community and the game is going in a better direction give it a try
i want an old player in this game i started playing this game when my friend introduced me to the game i didst like it much first of all there are constantly people crowding around the nexus spamming messages like by buy my stuff on this random website not just one person either imagine a whole army of people ask just spamming useless messages using bots second of all really good loot is hard to come by you play for a long time and if you re really lucky you might get to or to items i once played through for three hours but not get any items above to good items they re all in the shops and all of them are super overpowered and great free to play bitch please this int no free to play game people who pay kill steal you at boss battles and the others the premium players they wont get anything because the mob of ups cleared everything if kab am stopped owning this game i would play it more otherwise its almost a complete piece of she
room is a good game for those who enjoy a challenge and people who will not quit and get extremely upset over a character dying and losing everything on said character room recently was bought by a company known as dec games and they are very active in the community compared to how the previous owners of the game kab am who neglected the game for a few years room or realm is a really fun game if you can get passed its difficult points and is all around a great time if you treat your time playing realm with a positive attitude towards the game
name
it done get any more simulation than this epic game with stunning visuals huge learning curve when trying to master just one jet and that the beauty of it there is so much to learn and master
smite has the potential to be a great game unfortunately hire gets in the way of it every chance they get they do absolutely nothing to address the god awful community this game has game balance or the several bugs prevent in this title hire makes it pretty obvious that their only plan is to produce more skins which do look great at ridiculous prices and gouge what players they have left for as long as they can anything requiring real effort on their part outside of this will be ignored
this games a little over my head in terms of detail the controls allow you to manage far too many different aspects of the plane for my taste i did finally get the hang of flying but after trying and failing to arm and use my weapons for the thirtieth time i know this game is not the one for me maybe ill try again sometime when i have some hours to memorize the keys and their modifiers of which there seem to be a couple hundred this is not a game for simple people like me
i payed ten bucks a month to go shoot pixel deer and cry about my life why did i waste money on an extremely repetitive pay to play cleverly disguised as free to play i didst it want a wasteful purchase at all because it taught me to be more careful about what i spend money on i learned that things a rent always what they seem sometimes you download a free to play game and sometimes news you in the without lube done call it an free to play if its not ign this game gave me cancer ola
meh its somewhat fun heres my issue the game kinda bottom neck grinds your face the tutorial i get do this okay now do this but after the tutorial the game still doesn't let you really play to your liking it still tells you what you can do next which is only ever one option basically most of the game is click next to continue and that button moves then you get to battle may then go back to click next to continue whats that you wanted to buy more consumables to help you nah you gotta buy a tank from another country now but i wanna upgrade my gun tough now sell that important thing you probably will need but i wanted that here let me buy one back from the shop nah time for battle that this game if i wanted a comic about tank video games ida downloaded that
after initially being very impressed by this game after slow and stale development is has slowly lost its charm and now is left in other racing sims dust sim in are now masters of empty promises maybes and excuses stay away from this game
early access review played for almost an hour but had to get back to work but this game is amazing so far i say this is the free alternative to min craft very easy to get started crafting is easy i can see myself playing this for a period of time every day i also like the more modern texture appearance of the blocks only thing live noticed is that occasionally there is very high server latency of over is aside from that i give this game five stars thus far
early access review first good battle royal game since pub in my top three games and i usually play car games or ark would recommend this game for a lot of fun and a great open world experience
early access review absolutely fun game i was checking for a few games that free to play and this one i kept playing till five hundred and thirty in the morning for nine hours straight you can play it either in single player or player versus player and up is a lot of fun the graphics are fantastic just like in hearthstone and they have a lot of elements from magic the gathering without the complete complexity or adding the extra chores from it when you versus other people the wait time is only a few seconds so there are a heap of people playing right now i cant be bothered writing a review so try it out they are very generous at the moment so get in and get all your free stuff and play against the artificial intelligence or other players and rake it all in before they change it where they re less generous
early access review my most favoured hated game a its fabulousness ugliness and originality yeah originality my just shine through the heavens deepest of holes it is fully recommended not to get this beautiful ugly as fuck game it only costs zero dollars want my zero dollars back when you are banned put out of misery then done worry or just leave this game lao just spend over six hundred dollars to urban yourself done seems legit yes one hundred sep million fifty sex million three hundred and fifty two quintillion four hundred and five quadrillion eight hundred and two trillion four hundred and thirty nine billion six hundred and eight three million four hundred and nine thousand six hundred and fifty our million quadrillion quintillion million trillion would spend six hundred dollars again
this game is fun for about two days then it gets lame you do the same thing over and over again new town defeat dungeon new town defeat dungeon it center unbalanced player versus player and you only spam a a then maybe two skills minute three hundred and ten
note the review has been updated to include the campaigns content never winter is an massively multiplayer online by perfect world entertainment this allows us to predict two things one the amount of cash required will be huge the classes will be split into the usual archetypes starting out you'll get to pick your race between all the usual do races and have a choice of class this confirms suspicion two in that there is the devout cleric healer guardian fighter tank and a bunch of other classes damage dealers you'll have an option between the control wizard which deals a lot of damage from a distance has the ability to crowd control multiple enemies throw enemies off cliffs which is invaluable at high level dungeons as its an instant kill and is very very squishy the main job of this class apart from throwing enemies off ledges is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss the great weapons fighter which is a berserker with a two handed weapon standard frontline damage dealer this class can either target the boss or the adds depending on equipment and the specific boss in question the trickster rogue who relies on stealth for solo play and does single target damage in dungeons this class main job is to kill the bosses the hunter ranger who frankly has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard the hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses the skills also have separate cool downs for each of the stances combat is simple in this game you have two at will attacks much akin to auto attacks which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default those do not have cool down though they can have charges you then have three encounter skills which are basically active skills mapped to her by default lastly you have a daily power which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often the skills require a certain amount of action points which are gained by doing class specific tasks healers heal damage dealers deal damage and i assume tanks block or absorb damage though i haven made one to confirm it these could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to one and two by default there the feat system which is basically passive bonuses for your character and then there the two active passives slots those are skills that give you passive benefits but are not feats meaning they take your active skill points rather than your feat points and you can only have two of those at a time you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar you can have more skills but those are the most you can have useable at any one time equipment is your standard massively multiplayer online system five rarity levels which are in order white common basic equipment green uncommon equipment blue rare equipment purple epic equipment range purple equipment is also split into tiers tier one is obtained from the basic level sixty dungeons while tier two is obtained from more difficult level sixty dungeons so far so standard where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it something like sockets in diabolo and those have several ranks you can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine up to a one success rate at level eight rank ten is the highest if you spend real money you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed well this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money but lets pretend it doesn't and go on i should probably mention the artefact system these are items that you can equip up to three of one primary and two secondaries which you can refine like the enchantment stones like the enchantment stones you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process the primary artefact grants you an active ability and some stats while the secondary artefacts only grant you the stats each player gets one at level twenty one in a bind on equip state though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip this bug appears to be unique to the artefacts the game features a companion system free players get a white one which can reach rank fifteen equivalent to player level thirty for twenty five you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank thirty equivalent to player level sixty bag space is of course limited in order to increase it players must pay real money the large bag costs twenty four slots ten storage space is likewise limited and more storage slots can be bought for real money player versus player exists but there no real matchmaking system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced its a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better one skills are fairly frequent story wise there int that much there it would appear a a salvatore wrote the beginning then the lore then the new campaigns and then left the entire mid game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city the writing is what you can expect from salvatore your enemies are more evil than the combination of satan and hitler while you are playing as the pure good hero who cant even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill for rogues or kit items that will clutter up your inventory the campaigns which i mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game unlike other parts of the game they revolve around daily quests which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character which require astral diamonds read on for those and access to two endgame instances with some of the best equipment unfortunately the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high which will hurt new players who want to player versus player and of course i saved the worst for last the game features a currency called astral diamonds you receive this currency from various daily tasks playing player created content completing dungeons playing in player versus player in a rough form and must refine them in order to use them the currency is gated at a refinement of twenty four thousand a day a very small amount for free users but players can trade real money for more astral diamonds is used to buy various useful items vanity items new companions new mounts upgrade the rarity level of a companion from white to green or green to blue or blue to purple or a mount same as the companion as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character from the campaign quests now the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering it costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green that is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level cap unless you sell your artefact you can get another one if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artefact pack to top all of this off the game is riddled with bugs geometry bugs item bind bugs enemy behavior skill behavior it center and the no infamous perfect world entertainment support is just worthless so overall would i recommend this game well if you have an insures sable need to empty the contents of your wallet by all means go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay town experience otherwise no in afraid i cant recommend it
early access review it is fun has good mechanics doesn't present new things doesn't abuse the online element like hearthstone does sex bomber nos dorm and all the other weird cards its pretty old school to be honest too old school done get me wrong i like mtg but this game lacks a lot because of this power energy system sometimes in draft i get five cards that i can draw lands with but they done appear and if they do appear i have the wrong type of land most of my games were decided from the first draw which makes it so not fun for me for a skill accented game it is pretty luck based with this weak starts still it has cool stuff and i prefer playing against artificial intelligence cut it int taking ages but i just done recommend it
ignore the poor reviews no different than any other free to play game you get what you pay for free account lets you hunt mule deer and rabbits subscriptions or one time hunting licenses for time periods let you get a shot at the rest other stuff such as tents it center are perks and flare
early access review this game is awesome live played a ton of magic and this is similar but better the card set is a masterpiece created by a bunch of magic hall framers very highly recommended give it a try
the game itself is pretty interesting for a mob but inevitably poor matchmaking makes me unable to recommend it if you care about having a good competitive experience one regularly encounters long streaks five games of noncompetitive rounds where your team is simply over matched as a group and doesn't even sniff destroying an objective or two as the opposing team just rolls over you which after awhile is pretty uninspiring inversely its also much more common in my experience to blow out the other team than have a tight balkan forth round where your actions really do matter id say optimistically that maybe ten or so of my matches were actually close with well matched teams when the matchmaking does work it is pretty good fun but sadly its a much rarer of an occurrence than i am willing to put up with
early access review it reminds me of data and laugh out loud just without the creeps people need to hold and push down space lanes accordingly capture resource points to then acquire upgrades for their ships once your teams ships are strong enough to take on the enemies final base a window must be seized perhaps when some enemies are re spawning its a great game requiring tactics teamwork patience and planning shame the only people i come across seem to be incapable of understanding this bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know if both blobs pick opposite lanes whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice if both blobs meet they fight the blobs will then reform and repeat the most excruciating part though is waiting for a game i recommend this though in the hopes that one day enough tactics minded people will play this beautiful game and ill start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles
early access review have played this game hours at a time i am addicted i have managed to get two of my friends addicted as well the only problem i have with the game is just my problem neither of my friends experience it so it in to a problem and i can live with it since i don to have to deal with it much but if you have to know what it is the light the extractor gives off makes me a little sick for some weird reason but only when i look right at it if i turn away i am no longer sick but it only happens for me so i a not too concerned its so funny and you don to have to use it often that i just don to care
if you re into combat flight simulators look no further digital combat simulator offers a chance to step into a legendary aircraft with unparalleled precision and accuracy true to its original design granted you may be reading a book for about a month until you re at a minimum proficiency with the aircraft but the payoff is worth it the sense of achievement that you get when you learn any of these aircraft is amazing as its not just a case of pumping the throttle to maximum to take off like other plane games the future is very bright for this simulator as it is ever growing with more developers creating different aircraft for different theatres of war i a wii korea a modern May
product received for free this is mob us two live got a frog foot on my tail poses advise over this is mob is one i got him in my sights missile away good separation impact in three two one mark hostile do personal computer battery goes dead were got a personal computer down we got a personal computer down all because its so addicting
team fortress two has been regularly updated since its inception in two thousand and seven after over nine years in development due to all these updates the game has actually taken on several incarnations in other words i will be individually reviewing the following three separate games team fortress two hat fortress two dress up fortress two present but first general you can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed scouts can fly by flapping their legs can of soda turns you into the super matrix you can make bullets dodge you some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancers melted boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy whipping people makes them run faster big russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an antitank missile as a russian to tank can blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their make you can beat people to death with a bottle of whisky you can decapitate people with a golf club harmless explosives eating a sandwich will cure aids mend katanga wounds and treat your erectile dysfunction hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it upgrade it and resupply i dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing you can shoot up morphine with a crossbow you can use a beam of light to turn someone a exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium army pretending to play the violin with a bone saw used for amputation will cure the common cold urine is more effective than a fire with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck when they encounter australians with shields on their backs they all stab the shield first making the shield disintegrated pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket create a deceased doppelganger of you all while you become invisible and walk away if you backstay someone with an icicle they all instantly transform into a highly durable ice sculpture team fortress two this was a team based first person shooter involving two identical teams differing only in color and artistic design vying for control of various strategic locales around the world you could play as one of nine crippling over specialized classes the various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team however this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were and still are generally foreign concepts teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit hats were just a cool side thing many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat overall team fortress two was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved over nine out of nine worth the weight hat fortress two the man economy update released on september thirty two thousand and ten marked the end of team fortress two and the birth of hat fortress two players no longer needed to idle to get hats they could also buy them trade for them and even sell them for other hats in addition keys were also introduced giving players the ability to throw away their parents or their own hard earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats more often than not they ended up getting worthless virtual guns the man economy fever quickly swept over team fortress two reducing it to a side game hat fortress two was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the team fortress two mini game to show them off to others the free play update in twenty elevens further enlarged the player base increasing the popularity of hat fortress two its modes and related fun mini games as hat fortress two was further refined and developed new elements were added including unusual and non at cosmetic items eventually so many new cosmetics came in that hat fortress two gradually evolved into another game hats out of dress up fortress two present this is the current and ultimate form of team fortress two the game is entered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play you can acquire the components for your dream outfit by boxing crates of all shapes and sizes and or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there you can show off your outfits topped off with exorbitant unusual hats in a multitude of ways you can do the conga hi five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits play intense games of rock paper scissors or play jack blacks guitar you can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old team fortress two you could also play mann is machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become the man with the golden gun if neither of those are satisfactory there are a wide range of other mini games to play some of which have been around since the days of old team fortress two they include but are not limited to versus saxon hale freak fortress two jailbreak balloon race team fortress two kart magic spells in halloween event maps slender fortress surf maps jump maps and toward in conclusion dress up fortress two does provide something for everyone so i guess its alright iterations of gabon and my favourite class is the spy thanks and have fun september
very much enjoying this game can see myself replaying game few times a week or month its fun even is the artificial intelligence surface looks great variety of ships free under player versus player need more players game needs player rankings like world of tank down deep
love this steep learning curve but once you get the hang of it you have hours of game play ahead of you also you have the option of buying downloadable content to unlock more planes if you want
i think this is the best card game available online right now if you love the manama icky system creature to creature combat and a deep strategy experience the two lanes and the runes add a lot more in depth to playing and deck building than obvious at first glance it is free to play playable meaning that the rewards you can get by playing are really generous and capable of getting you at deck in a reasonable time frame not to mention that the developers really care about the game and the community and not only about their revenues as of today you can get daily twitch drops which are worth like ten you get daily quests for gold arena can give you packs entry fee for wins and you can even farm the artificial intelligence for soul gems
as a player that has played on and off for more than four years i can safely tell you that rooms best days are already gone kab am the owner of the game neglected the game for years the player base was shrinking and many duping hacking exploits where being used everywhere this could all make one turn away from this game however times are changing a new company called dec games has bought room and is striving to breath new life into it they have already established a connection with the community and have worked long hours to patch the exploits that made the game unplayable for the honest man because of the fact that room seems to be going in a very positive direction i would highly recommend this game
i never thought i would have to say this but team fortress two is garbage right now and valve doesn't care they re more focused to make this like counter strike a competitive ranked based shooter instead of being the casual shooter it was supposed to be valve doesn't care about how the game should be they done care how the game ends up as long as it makes them a quick buck that all that matters this
i highly recommend this game to anyone out there looking for something interesting and new i use to want to be a pilot so live been playing flight sims since i was seven and this game was easy to learn just by doing the tutorials and asking other players certain things
normal i am of with pay to play pay to win but this is taking the every animal a see the screen pops up i just wanted to kill like one thing i mean after hours of walking that what anyone would want a do get some free ones but i never found any in my seven hours of play
early access review really love the game but at the moment its the event is really rigged the dungeons bug out often and the low drop rate makes it really hard to farm for the outfits so at the moment i wont recommend until they fixed it
early access review fractured space is exactly what it says in its description you are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to position yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons abilities inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek battle star galactic dreadnought star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these game shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system still in early access so keep in mind some things may change their are a total of twelve ships which have varying unique properties graphics effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update having more local servers would be nice to reduce ping but its quite easy to find a game with each update the game gets better and better overall a great game essential a mob in space with large spaceships with flashy battles love to see how this develops the price for the forerunner and harbinger are with playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future edit updated with more current info May
early access review it has the feel of hearthstone in terms of graphics the ability to click the arena and the easy visual style the cards are not tiny like some games with the variety of color of mtg the artificial intelligence is a little non optimized but i think it will probably get better
what a crap game for new players join game get shot at spawn by snipers wait two minutes to revive before being able to join again unless you pay screw that uninstalled instead
planet side one was a ground breaking mops the very first first person shooter to be a true massively multiplayer online with a one hundred and thirty three is one hundred and thirty three is one hundred and thirty three massive fights that spanned air sea for the mag riders and land planet side two is not that everything good and unique about playstation one was left out of planet side two there was a frenzy of excitement prior to the launch of playstation two tens of thousands of players were chomping at the bit to get a piece of the action then the infamous ship it fiasco of premature release coupled with an entirely inept development team led by john medley the co of see drove it straight into the ground i have seldom been so disappointed in anything i absolutely do not recommend this game the development team has completely dissolved and see is grasping at straws to keep this pig afloat because of the playstation two release i am personally boycotting anything see is involved in
downloaded game excited to try it out and nothing locks up every time and cant get past loading screen running is in ski and supposedly its an spitfire issue fix your sheet people
rarely write reviews but this time i really felt compelled to do so therefore forgive me if it will be a long one and probably boring short story you should really give this game a true chance without the prejudice of any review good or bad i am so disappointed to see so many bad reviews from people that have played this game two hours at max and from people that still need to get to finish the story and or get a decent gear this game has potential it is not like every other game out there it gives you a true free play option the in game shop is just cosmetics and you can get the in game shop currency just by playing the game dungeon grinds and conversion of points in currency there is an anti cheat now that has killed all the cheaters the ones that are leaving bad reviews i can bet on it you'll have open player versus player everywhere in contested areas of the huge map there is a lot of content if you want to look for content instead of rushing end game and complain that there is no content up and ave is balanced and the player versus player is truly that as most games have arena duels and matchmaking bullshit this game has a lot of very well done content but as every game has things that need to be improved it is your choice you can see only the bad things or you can see the good ones too and acknowledge that nothing is as you wish it to be one hundred the game has performance issues as every massively multiplayer online game out there the graphics are in range with every other massively multiplayer online as well now you'll need to tweak your own in i file to get the best out of the game graphics it can be annoying i understand that but there are hundreds of guides out there that can help you do it in five min and you'll need to go into your vida control panel and switch the games ram from integrated to dedicated this game messed up badly at launch this is very true but at the same time the development team behind this game is not greedy as some would love to see you convinced about the development team listens to the community and strives to improve this game every day keep in mind that the people playing the game make the community if the cheaters that bought this game want to leave a bad review out of spite i cannot say anything more than to stop reading at the reviews and give this game a true chance it is free now nevertheless ill keep buying my premium membership which doesn't give any pay to win advantage to support the deus because this game deserves to be successful more than do owned test owned and whatever massively multiplayer online role playing game you can think about i have played them all is even though most people got refunded the purchase of the game they still complain you'll have to decide for yourselves who in bad faith but for as far as i can tell it is not the development team i am just tired of people don voting games that deserve tho shine while up voting trash games
the downloadable content kara mari hospital is awesome its tribute to silent hill with a little resident evil mixed in if your a fan of jump scare mansion and horror genre titles the downloadable content is definitely for you development is also active with updates and posts on forum
addicted game unfortunately there int an account bound if you buy a companion or mount only a character bound with a lot of astral diamonds you can buy lot of fun stuff the auction house live bought the dinosaur today with and the game has fantastic graphics great dreamy environment i like it a lot because i am photographer in real life every detail is a capture the never winter battles are exciting my number one game for years keep up the great work never winter this game is complete
early access review as it is now this game is a chore to play lots of performance issues keep me from playing it for more than fifteen minutes before i get tired of glitching out and being stuck in loading screens ill pick it up again if its fixed and ready to be played properly
i done hate the game but the game hates me it uses box controls and theirs no way to fix it i reinstalled this game three times and nothing has worked when my first dweller came my camera shot up into the corner and went straight back there when i tried to move the camera to look at the dwellers stats
while this game is very fun the servers are god awful the support is god awful the endless events that just make the servers overloaded are awful losing your hard worked character to some in lag is absolutely the worst feeling ever especially when it happens twice in a row
creatives is a dense action packed game that is bound to glue you to your screen i recommend that you get it because it is very fun for those who like the adventure type thing it is min craft rob lox and terra ria mixed together with a little spice of its own seriously get it it is free play awesome and all out perfect for all the boys and girls who like the survival type games
early access review loved mtg played for four hundred hours of two thousand and twelve two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fifteen duels i hate hearthstone ring fest and casual mechanics they took what is best of mtg combat fast spells strategy deck building used a great user interface and fast paced game flow only thing useful from hearthstone and made this incredible game totally worth the experience i already sum sixty hours in the first two weeks
cant give this game a recommendation with the new spotting system and ground forces russian bias it used to be great now its simply russians with shells that have twice the high explosive filling then other factions stay away go play something else until it gets balanced one day one can only hope
frankly i done even know why i play this game maybe because i am busy with work and it feels a bit better to have a game you can leave running without checking at all or even leave it offline feels like playing without playing pros compared to other clickers it has more features catering to playing offline or ask things like big production bonuses to offline play and auto spell casting when you re away it has a lot of unlock able long term you will unlock things weekly for a very long time possibly months or even years depending how much time you put into the game frankly its even too much but that how these type of games are the concept of playing a being that reincarnated and can control multiple races is kind of interesting and the mathematical optimisation is good exercise for the brain if you re into that kind of min maxing nerdy stuff cons i would not advise anyone to play this for free the gift of the herein goods are kind of a must else the restarting process at each abdication which happen every few minutes sometimes becomes way too time consuming even with all the unlock able there is still missing a sens of progression you can play for days without unlocking anything at all which can feel super grind and often tempting to give up on the game the descriptions are often vague especially for trophies often there are specific conditions to the trophies that are required and not written thus you can waste days trying to get a trophy one way before you realize something is missing through trial and error or asking on the forums the art could have been better its pixilated but much better has been done in this style seeing the time you spend looking at the same screen and art it can be improved greatly and quickly since the art assets are very few and fit on one screen should you get it as i said i done even know why i am playing it i could give up at any time do i recommend it i done think so but since its free you can check it out for yourself and forge your own opinion however if you already know that you like clicker games this one is definitely worth checking out
very fun game and after the latest updates the game hast been crashing that much sometimes a terrible la spike but that rare now for me i have been playing thirty five hours in the last two weeks because live been enjoying it that much you can better play with some of your friends because if you play all alone you re basically feed negative things are the people in the community they re shooting you instantly when they see you even though you re unarmed when you re just new to the game and just installed it you might experience some crashes but after many hours of playing it will go away crashing doesn't occur that much anymore so yeah i recommend this game since its fun to play and you can enjoy it for a long time with your friends
seriously try this game if you like space games light strategy mob or anything spaceship related this game is worth your time with a diverse roster of ships separated into three different manufacturers and five different classes this game oozes variety ninety nine times out of one hundred there will be a ship perfectly suited to you the tier system is split up into five ship tiers and three matchmaking groups within those tiers giving you the perfect pace and style of play to suit your skill with the game and the strength of your ship progression through these tiers while a bit long is very enjoyable and wont leave you bored to death as you grind to the next tier with the free to play price tag the only thing you re losing by trying this game is internet quota because i assure you dreadnought is well worth your time
game in general is pretty basic fun way to pass time i made a video showing how to get billions of chain fast for the people who done want to spend hours clicking tips wow youtube co watch but the
okay as the player who has hrs with all accounts and non steam i can say that right now the game looks ugly when i came to the game after two months break i expected cool features it center but you made an update for user interface which looks ugly of smite was an original game in my opinion and now it looks like paladins or smith put the old user interface back or i quit this game forever laugh out loud
love this game on my phone but will not work with either my laptop or desktop computers both capable at gaming i spent a little over a week with three different support staff members at bethesda trying the game both through steam and bethesda own launcher would not connect to their servers with all ports forwarded and firewall exceptions made after my experience on personal computer i can not recommend on this platform ridiculous since it works with no problem on my phone on the same network
just awesome one of the best massive multiplayer games live ever seen only not so awesome thing is that the newbies always want to steal my galaxies and crush them into the next mountainside in addition i cant fly it anyways
early access review absolutely loved adventure quest worlds so i was excited when this came out so far in impressed but i feel some time needs to be given for this game to get better but if you done feel like waiting give this game a try there lots of stuff to do and even though the level cap is like fifteen or something it will take a while to level also i heard from some friends that there some different play styles to try out
seven of ten cheating in a match so many cheat in rob craft and free am only cares about profanity they could care less if everyone is cheating but do not leave a match you must finnish gaming with the cheaters half of my friend list used to play this game now one its like crosscut but with crazy management that totally changes the game every six months rob craft was the best game i ever played now its a goofy game filled with exploits and cheaters
one of the best games i ever played done listen to the other dudes you can play it for free and it is still awesome better than min craft it is even greater if you spend twenty bucks and that a nothing for a great game play it you will love it
this is by far one of my all time favourite games with a wide variety of different game modes classes and load outs you can do so much with this game also community servers provide different games demos allowing you to choose your preference such as rocket jump maps versus saxon hale surf it center the most enjoyable aspect of this game is that you a rent strictly abide to just do the objective of the game half of the time i just goof around with a sandwich in my hand as the heavy while if i wanted to i could also play the game a bit more seriously overall this game never gets old and you can always experience something new each time you play the game
early access review of my god this game is the worst i have no idea how a game like this can make its way on steam do or self a favor and by counter strike go and by the way the game runs like dogs the maps are so plan and boring the game is ugly and its not in a good way like when a play some old nintendo sixty four game so fun this shim out
early access review matchmaking system has gotten to the point where games are always one sided the new ranking system for robots has done nothing to balance out teams at least in the old system we knew we would likely face a team with the same number of each weapon type now yeah good luck steer clear of this game
it is not free its basically a demo if you want content you gotta buy it and if you add up all the prices of content it works out at a very expensive game better off buying factor two
this program still needs a lot of work for example full screen doesn't work properly makes graphics awful and shifts input so that mouse doesn't select buttons properly managed one training mission in windowed mode in full screen i was left sitting on the runway unable to do anything as a long time in flyer in not impressed
really nice game most detailed weapon game ever i have seen major pros cons detailed any weapons to choose from language options completed weapon structures hard to focus on single part of uncut focus int working well overall pts nine hundred and ten in my opinion you should try this game if want to expand your knowledge
you cant call game free to play if you have to pay real money to pay for tracks and competitions to play game lags on every crash to the wall on the other hand cars have nice sound and i hope they will be releasing updates and make this game better potential is real
the fan base is terrible the experience tables are the voice actors are awful the pay to win aspect ruins the game and player versus player in general a els word is terrible id recommend playing on one of the private servers instead
early access review pretty good game to play not to long of a download and shooters can go a long way this just makes it plain and simple very good game to pass the time with if you like quick shooters
early access review free weekend download review matches should be filled to playable levels for the next month before dropping to low two hundred player pop so play while you can tips steam is pretty basic one capture the enemy bases around sectors with titanic space battleships alongside your team upgrade your ship over the course of a match capture the enemy home base to win controls are pretty good once you get hang of moving your ship the ship themselves feel slow and colossal while moving at least for the starter ship weapon abilities add flare of visual to the chaos upgrade skill tree adds some complexity to ships game runs great on a engine the ship models look cool but the environment look bland replay is showplace worth a spin on the free weekend and introduction to the space battleship games like it but as a game there is much to be desired seeing as this is an early access game maps for example if it want for the micro transaction market integrated in the game id recommend buying the game in full however game of similar business models and unlock systems run into balance issues with veteran players and newbies so i can to recommend putting money down sorry deus if the game was fifteen flat and you unlocked everything as you played the game i recommend but the micro transactions just complicate things that don to have to be games like these from my experience are in development for a long time and take forever to release just look at hawke with a similar micro transaction model and release year the game has been liked by a players but only has low populations of vets that play and spend money because they already invested heavily into it while no one else is willing to jump into the game thus prolonging development of the title
live been playing this game for two years now and almost love how there is about fifty different characters and the game is very cheap plus you can earn new characters in about thirty four hours without having to buy them plus i love all the funny skins definitely recommend the game to people who are struggling to find a good fun game for free plus the game has no storyline and a new character is released every two or three weeks so the game is endless fun
simplistic rogue like with surprisingly large open worlds where its easy to find yourself in challenging areas the loot in this game is very situational with most drops containing items from other classes which are utterly useless unless you have friends or a group with you but with the large amount of drops its easy to just ignore the useless ones the game is also flooded by spambots advertising a wow pay for gold system which is also easy to ignore for the simplicity and quirkiness its worth the money to buy this game zero is quite a bargain but its great to pick up and play for a few minutes in your spare time
early access review this game hoo horrible the guns are bad your wasting minutes of your life just downloading and playing this game in fact just looking at the title is a wast of time
early access review this game is full of hackers of is a major hacker in this game getting inst kills soon as you log in it seriously lags and has not that many passionate players who rely on skill if you love to hack then this is the game for you
early access review replay ninety counter strike global offensive and ten battlefield no buy menu and ads menu and style crossfire type are to play but use micro transaction for extras i would prefer a paid version and call it counter strike global offensive two
first when i play this game i thought it is a good game but eventually the more i play the more i hate this game this game is just dominate by bunch of cheater done tell me that in bad at this game or whatever whoever played this game should know what happened ninety nine of the opponent i face have perfect hand and myself always get bad hand sorry i done believe this is luck kenai also did not do their best to banned those cheater if you want to play card game i will suggest to play it go
this game has a new owner dec games and i really like it you should really try this game if your interested in up my cons are eight bitty opinion some servers are saggy but dec is trying to fix it pros this game is a bullet hell game means that there is a bunch of shots on the map which i really like you can create clans to destroy everything sadly just that no buffs a fourteen unique made this game awesome again is you get free items if you get in
this review is written during the introduction of the british tank line i played this game during the sale of a package for thirty it includes three months of premium time and crate load of premium currency during three months of premium fast progression through the tech tree but not amazingly fast that skill was inadequate for the next tier battles all annoyance like clearly mandatory module was easily obtain credit flows nicely able to team up with two players rather than after premium mostly ground battle progression slow down to a crawling ground battle where repair tools and fire extinguisher is apparently lock behind unlock wall so if you re tracked or on fire during a match you are soldering my play there is an exploit where user can turn down graphic to hide away all the foliage other play that play at high setting like myself is at a disadvantage after unlocking tier two understand that you will fight against tier three tanks which clearly outclass the previous tier overall game minimal is hard to read for first time its too complex to read at a glance some texts do not stand out to alert the player of what is happening to their vehicles battle tier arcade is ridiculous how can a stock tank at tier two fight with any competence against a tier the grind is real imagine korean massively multiplayer online grind real all tanks are not made equal so your duel is already decided on who got the jumping favor first yes ring is a factor in this game where a shell travelling through the tank shattered minor injury only unless you re on the receiving end all hell broke lose addendum the beginning british tank are pathetic turret traverse so slow you wonder if the turret ring is made of granite that the tank crew turn using a wooden crank

its a clicker idle game but its pretty addictive there are a tonne of upgrades to unlock and each faction has its own spin on them unfortunately the game lacks any music but rest assured the soothing sound of frantic mouse clicks will keep you company the background map is pretty basic and changes only occur when you unlock a new building or change faction the men icons are fairly well done though and at the end of the day you re probably going to leave it idle ninety of the time to rack up money realm grinder is a free game but tucked away inside are a bunch of micro transactions these a rent forced or intrusive so in fairly neutral on their existence for the sake of transparency the micro transactions cover things like increasing click building rate purchasing rubies increase production converting your gems increase percentage without resetting your progress and fast forwarding the game overall if you like clicker idle games then you'll probably love this if you re looking for something with a bit more depth or story then look elsewhere
dirty wolf is a talented developer and being a collectible card game genre fan i mainly played their second game eternal though after studying eternal deeper i be found out that its large seventy five cards deck and mana screw flood problem basically turn it to a coin flip simulator when i tried is legends i immediately saw that it improved several magic concepts including mana and ring issues i was a bit concerned about recent changes to the game but looks like they be just changed the client and the technical problems are being solved by the regular patches so since the core of the game want touched i definitely recommend it as one of the best digital card games on a market
one of the largest and by far the most versatile of the morphs on the market since having left ever quest for ever quest ii this has been my home that always calls me back from my visits to other games
i wish i could say that i enjoy this game i really do but the games devolved the only way you can get enjoyment out of this is if you grind for hours and hours and hours and hours or just spend twenty two thousand four hundred and sixty one on bullshit downloadable content because we re obviously willing to spend that much on a game like this and be proud of it the game got bland and boring for me after a while its just the same old dungeons re skinned to look different if you talked to me about a year ago i would be said yeah try it but if you talk to me nowadays ill say hell no stay away from that godforsaken grind est that is trove
insanely addicting game may get frustrating at time as you die over and over and over again but it is worth it and there are perks to dying as you get fame to use in game also the pets system is amazing you can level your pets up completely with in game currency but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet it is definitely easier for paying users overall great game its free so why not try it May
early access review its a good game but it has a lot of issues mostly with balance get it if you like world of tanks because that all you will get form it every battle tanks is infantry
early access review pros treeless buggy than pub and its more stable game dynamics are great cons ran up a a hill no problem minor bugs here and there but there is always room for improvement
its a neat base management mobile game come to steam not much else to it first and foremost if you re planning on playing this full screen you might want to look elsewhere this game is incredibly slow paced play it windowed off to the side while you watch youtube videos or the news or wait for a real game to install it is a mobile game and plays as such you build your very own vault and micromanage the residents within you construct rooms send brave souls out into the wasteland to scavenge for materials fight fires manage your three main resource pools fight off raider attacks for a mobile game let alone a free mobile game its quite something its obviously marketed to fallout fans but i done think there any reason a newcomer to the franchise would be scared off i really like it live actually got about forty hours in it before steam picked it up and haven paid a cent you can buy speedup items if you re a small impatient child with unsupervised access to your mods credit card but otherwise its just not worth it its free and surprisingly comprehensive for a mobile game give it a shot
friend payed real world money to cheat and become a better than everyone in this game the one with the more money is the winner a quote from him its not my fault that i have money and others don capitalism mpg
i spent fifteen hours out of the two hour playtime to just get past the title splash screen first person shooter poor optimization terrible localization frequent disconnections the bugs and glitches are endless tried really hard to give it a fair play and i get that its an early access but hey its gotta be playable at the very least take my advice done buy this and just refund if you've made the mistake edit the servers are being shut down one after the other in different regions should be enough justification
team fortress two first started as a team based shooter now a heaven for hat trades even though the game looks nothing like it was more than a decade ago it still feels similar the game is good the game is free and its not pay town it doesn't hurt to try
early access review ont play this game seriously the game has a great idea path progression faction based fighting awesome ideas perfect until you actually play the game horrible hit detection ballistics like shooting tennis balls and at least one hacker per match also snipers snipers everywhere and why not the game rewards you to be a sniper the longer range a kill the higher the experience with an average weapon you get five maybe six experience for a kill ten if savior meaning you stored them from killing a buddy sixty if defensive meaning inside a cap point average sniper kill at two hundred meter seven thousand five hundred and eighty not adding defensive or savior so you can imagine every match has at least half the teams made of snipers also very pay to win the bought mrs and sub mrs can almost snipe themselves and the basic rifle has to be almost point blank to hit that is of course the hit detection lets you saggy as all hell ping is a very big problem buggy just overall a poorly done game could be an awesome game if done right but its not and sadly this games ideas are almost exactly what i think an awesome world war two shooter would be but i end up raging ninety of the time if you want to try it and at least pretend like you found the world war two shooter your looking for go for it but for god sakes done give them any money
when i heard last year there was gonna be a card game for elder scrolls i thought it was gonna be lame but then six months ago i decided to download it and play it and figure ill give it a chance i was really surprised about how good it was and i never liked hearthstone but this game surprised me i think its a better version of hearthstone for everyone who asks if its pay to win or not i have been playing for a long time now and ill tell you right now it is not you can get a lot of good cards in the game without paying a only thing you will pay for is stories or if you done have patience and want shortcuts you can buy card packs and see if you get lucky
full voice acting equipped items show dramatic game changing classes hard to play alone no tutorial good plot story okay combat amazing graphics great game play doesn't require a powerful computer total point age seven thousand five hundred and ninety five my opinion nine hundred and ninety five
what could've possibly been the greatest online game of the decade is being actively ruined by a company that both has no idea what they re doing and doesn't give a anymore i want to recommend this game to you its one of my all time favourites live met countless friends and competing in smite has genuinely made me develop as a person and shaped me into who i am today the game at its core is unbelievably fun but hire doesn't in care and so neither should you done waste your time in so in upset man
once installed i decided it was not for me so i uninstalled it via steam but this game is like the worst malware ever it did to uninstall i can to uninstall from the add and remove programs there is also no uninstall eye in the games folder very poor show
early access review well had fun not trying to get this to work still trying to get it to uninstall from my computer looks a good game and managed to get three games of it yesterday but today after many attempt to get this game working i have decided it int worth spending over forty minutes trying to and still cant even get it to uninstall of well back to pub
early access review played footnote much footnote before a month i already decided to drop the game since the developers care more for the mass of players and done implant a good competitive mode or something anyways here in back on a royal again the game feels pretty good even though the animations are a bit cringe development you provided with smite already that it can goes way better the gunplay is really nice shots are hitting the ability give some fresh air and are fun to use and play against the map is well designed so its a really good game a big point is no solo mode why why of should you bring out a battle royal game without solo why do i have to learn the game by fighting a that really stupid and i see no point why there int all ready a solo mode the ranking system is of but senseless right now and then every class use the same character model yes you can say its alpha but this are some things made pretty fast lets look if the community will stay and hope updates come quick then it could be my new main game edit solo patch out now forget that true the jump animation looks like a stick in the a a a
even after three thousand hours with a few crappy updates and a few updates that after a little work became great i still cant leave this game alone love this game to much to just drop it and let it die with a few bad updates
i first started playing rob craft way back when the game was in alpha my older brother showed me the game and i really enjoyed when it rolled over to stream i played the hell out of it but when they removed tiers and added ranks and the whole crate system i stopped playing the game because i hated the way they changed it i missed the old rob craft in leaving this review because they are finally making the game good again bringing back tiers and removing crates bringing back the old tech tree system i believe that with this update people might be able to play the good version of rob craft again so if your looking into this game since its free just try to take a look at it its an amazing game have a fantastic day
there is so many things wrong with this game cant look down while running everyone is a when you die you get kicked from the game and have to wait four minutes for your character to recover i have been kicked from games for no reason such a pay to win that was all the stuff i had a problem with but that me this game might get better might
it doesn't really run that well on my computer but massive persistent open world battles are pretty much my favourite thing in a multiplayer game and this game is basically the best one if you want to experience that plus this game has a pretty good free to play model so just give it a whirl
spent so much time and money in to this game and lord its worth getting and buying if first time something from the mann co store suggest a mann co key doesn't matter what kind i still remember my first time with team fortress two i didst understand it much about it but now its my most played steam game ten cotillion and ten for team fortress two
i tried to like it looked on reviews and game plays but getting stomped from players that started earlier in ranked games not cool needs a fix in rank system cards to destroy permanents ongoing effects where one is violet one violet yellow and one uncoloured is unbalanced needs an fix for the ongoing system starting second is a too big bonus getting three extra mana is heavy rebalanced this please its just no fun do try getting your dailies done do grow up when the wording is confusing and sometimes done count because of this misunderstanding of wording sorry for the rant but newbies getting stomped to much and the only way to get a way around is too much money infest
early access review this is a very unique and great game the reason i love it is it scares me so badly and yet i am determined to finish it what this game does is it sets you in a false sense of security makes you feel like one room is safe and okay and then when you go to the next room it rips you to pieces with its terrifying jump scares from the monsters i hate you weeping angel puppet master you scare me to bits but its awesome to the cute little jump scares this game has it all if you enjoy horror and things that can really set you in the right mood to want to scream then check this game out i done recommend it to people who are susceptible to heart attacks because this game could cause one if you done take a break every now and then but other than that this game is awesome and i love it cant wait for it to be finished fully three
not an first person shooter fan never mind the massively multiplayer online aspects of this but it brought me in from starting simple doing basic me engineer support to getting the kit needed to mix it in a huge variety of scenarios for lone combat to tactical squad devastation via vehicular devastation to creating and holding strategic places always a wide range of open platoons to join and how if you re looking for squad engagements and outfits to join if you re looking to get deeper into training and strategy or just sod it and spend a few hours as a rampaging max or a lone sniper live never played fifty hours on any game up until this and somehow live managed to shoehorn five hundred hours into my life in amazed but that is how engrossing the is a great starting point for anyone new to the multiplayer aspects of fuses or games in general do it and choose van sovereignty of course coolest combatants with the coolest tech
team fortress two where do i even begin the trading the game play the hats the classes heres the scout the soldier the pro the demo an the heavy the engineer the medic the sniper and the spy they all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily nearly kill you or just annoy you to death the scout is the fastest class with his scatter guns pistols and his bats and he is also able to double jump in the air the soldier wields a rocket launcher a shotgun and a shovel and is the seconds lowest class the pro wields a flamethrower a shotgun and a fire axe and is a mysterious person whose gender is still unknown the demo an wields a grenade launcher stick bomb launcher and a bottle and is a man whose liver should have shrivelled up and died years ago from his drinking the heavy wields a mini gun a shotgun and since he is of so manly his bare fists and he is also the slowest class the engineer has a shotgun a pistol and a wrench he is able to build sentry guns dispensers and teleworkers to help attack the enemy team and support his team the medic wields a syringe gun a med gun and a bone saw hes a medical expert and his med guns can heal the team and be charge them which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time the sniper wields a sniper rifle no surprise there an sub machine gun sub machine gun and a kukri a big knife thingy hes australian hes got his sights on you and you re his next target finally we have the spy french elegant sneaky a lady killer metaphorically and a literal man killer he has his revolver his knife and his sapper which he can use to destroy the engineers buildings his knife can kill any enemy in the game with a backstay do i need to explain what a backstay is unless they are be charged or if a sniper is wearing the razorback which blocks backstay note these are just stock weapons there are tons of different weapons for you to try out mix and match baby the pamela team fortress two is often times a very fun competitive game where you can snipe stab shoot or stun through different weapons and different classes talked about above there are often two groups of team fortress two the ups pay to plays and free to plays free to plays ups are often known for having many cosmetics valuable weapons and skill while free to plays are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you re a spy my personal experience is that most free to plays i meet are actually quite good players with many maps many game modes and many players you re bound to have a good time why not try some powerhouse or maybe double cross perhaps banana bay what is competitive matchmaking competitive matchmaking means that you re put in a server with other players as good as you like in counterstrike global offensive this was much requested by the community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players or players much much better than you prayers were answered in the gun mettle update with the introduction of fortress two is sadly being slowly updated but these new updates often come in with the big guns some of the more recent updates as of january st twenty eighteen are the miss as twenty seventeen update and jungle inferno update there are also other major game updates from the past especially the user update love and war update and the mann is machine update many of these updates often have a source filmmaker sam video to introduce these updates and their features such as the meet the medic video for the user update the expiration date video for the love and war update and the leaked invasion video for the invasion update some updates instead get a comic such as the gun mettle update some of these events only last for a period of time and a rent permanent what do these updates introduce some of these updates in particular ones like the love war and user updates introduce bulk amounts of new items like cosmetics weapons and other items like paint for your hats and unusual effects to look good in up until the jungle inferno update no new weapons had been added since the tough break updated in thanks for reading my review three january
data two is completely free to play all heroes are available to everyone at all times and the experience you gain at an account level only serves to unlock ranked play skills vary wildly from player to player but the playing field they meet on is largely level regardless of how many hours or how much money they've put into the game
the game has such an up down style of competence so i would rate somewhere in the middle but as there are only two options in going to choose no it can be immensely fun and if made by any company rather than foreigner it could be a very good game but with the direction they re heading in not getting a fuzzy warm feeling on the good side it can be amazing fun with three different game styles with varying realism and tons of different world war two aircraft to choose from after a few hundred hours however the downsides of the game really show the balancing in it is usually questionable to downright bad especially at higher tiers where german and japanese world war two props see postwar american jet russian bias no but definitely some extensive support for the russians from deus where we get another yak to add to the pile of no options to opt out of game modes like the new and awful air domination which is one big cluster you done want to be a part of also odd alternate history matches that really should be able to be deselected this review is just for the air planes by the way ground forces is so terrible at the moment i done even want to mention it
amazing game but you have to buy a subscription every three thousand six hundred and twelve months that the only bad part and its really bad id gladly pay five thousand and sixty for the game once and only once this is the only reason i done play it more
this game is more addictive than drugs a but at beginning matchmaking are super unbalanced you cant see opponents darts if opponent disconnect in lobby you have to wait until opponent again connect or you will lose medals nobody want to wait twenty minutes so you will lose medals in both cases i love it although this problems and ill poop balloons again
the servers never work infestation
i played until level is and i can say that this game is extremely pay two win at higher level it is almost impossible to get any decent gear without investing a ton of time or money profession require quite a lot of time which people with a life done have it keeps the player tied to the game missions are repetitive and lack any originality and soon after the level thirty even weak mobs will be able kill you player versus player is poorly balanced and you will most likely get matched with some overpowered players who paid for their gear overall the game requires a lot of time from the player of erring very little in exchange unless you have a lot of money to spare for this game you will unlikely enjoy this game
haven enjoyed seven hundred at all playing a support feels terrible now with the changes to visibility and the maze of tree stairs everywhere trying to ward is just a nightmare it feels like as soon as one team starts getting ahead it just snowballs with the new talent system before seven hundred data was the only game i played but cant see myself continuing its basically a completely different game
team fortress two is an amazing game this is the best game live seen good setting good game play and mechanic team fortress two lasts for ten years or even more i play this game for laugh fun and mistake this game is unique nine classes hundreds of weapons i recommended it one of my most precious game live ever played
a game that will not only get you addicted to hats but also hyped up about breathe goal in this first person shooter multiplayer video game is to choose a team re blu and beat the other team in eight different official game modes king of the hill capture flag pushing learn inside a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weaknesses which guarantees there all be a game style that fits you you can also play coop where you team up with six other people to kill robots who came to attack the mann co store besides these official game types there are many others created by the community such as a medieval pro hunt if you ever get bored with playing which is unlikely but it can happen after more than two thousand hours you can always start collecting hats by trading reason why its often referred to as the number one hat simulator before this game i would to even have considered playing any cartoon like games but i a glad someone converted me its a game that filled with humour and will not get you bored easily more importantly its free why should to you give it a try at least but the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends and for the people who done have any friends with this game you'll sure get some even if this game has been out there for a while its still being updated on a regular basis new game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at halloween christmas and easter there is only one downside i can think of its quite large in size so make sure you have enough disk space
product received for free early access review this game was really interesting at the start but all the new things ruin it a could only use one weapon type and hat to aim at the beginning nowadays a can have different weapon types which means a can have a invincible robot cause a have anti ground and anti air cannons also a lot of the weapons are lock on now which also renders aircraft rather useless especially the more fragile ones this game had a lot of potential sadly its just a casual shooter nowadays i cant recommend a getting it
early access review this is probably the best free to play card game out right now its a shame its not as popular as money stone pros good mechanics free system that lets you get gold and cards with ease with the grinding being challenging but doable depth high level of strategy an arena game mode that lets you keep all the cards you picked and gives you gold and packs if you win a bunch of games ranked rewards cosmetics good development or development team cons minor connection issues might be just me games feel a little slow and sometimes drag out for a long time in talking forty minutes to an hour not for casuals vigils and the long tutorial
this game is absolutely fantastic been playing since closed beta and the deus have actively been balancing the game with frequent patches new cards every month an absolutely fantastic story expansion with wonderful voice acting and difficult challenges and all on top of very deep game play that in my opinion yes is superior to hearthstone having played is for two years and est since closed beta many months ago this is the game i can recommend more highly than any other in my steam library
fun hack and slash with a lot of variety it can scratch that itch to run and jump around and smash things just done get too invested in it or you'll get frustrated by how much you can buy your way to victory with your credit card but its very much enjoyable without all that especially if you only play with friends so that you done have to compare yourself with people whole dropped a bunch of
early access review hey if you guys could fix that bug where you randomly stop communicating with the server and your input means nothing until you restart the entire game and reconnect that be swell and this game might actually be playable other than the fact the game doesn't want to be played its fine not great but fine
early access review this game was one of those games i never thought it would grasp me so tight i was really amazed of it i have bought the pro feature after few hours of game play and i must say every cent worth it i have also brought my friends in this beautiful universe and we are all having fun in it the wiring system is very interesting and it is a thing that appeals even to grownups you really can do a lot of things you can let your imagination and thinking romp you can have a pleasant and chill time spiced a little bit by the adventure and fighting definitely would continue to play just give it a try
early access review very addictive and visually stunning game to play racing form sector to sector to conquer gives the game a sense of urgency and does not get boring what so ever only complaint is the matchmaking system spent over twelve hour trying to connect join game only to be gutted when the dreaded game aborted popped up every time not having the option to stop the dreaded matchmaking loop i had to control alt delete out of the game to stop this overtime other than that this game is on to something and having fully enjoyed my time spent playing this game is on my radar of games to get for sure
early access review really love adventure quest three dimensional i have grown up playing artie entertainments games mainly adventure quest dragon fable mech quest and adventure quest three dimensional which i realise might make me a bit bias pros it can be played cross platform on personal computer macintosh android apple is phones tablets a feature planned for the future allows you to combine the appearance of one piece of equipment to the stats of another it will constantly be updated by the aqua three dimensional team meaning it will have new things to do often the graphics are in the same style for adventure quest games and can be run on most computers it is a fun game and there are funny moments at least for me cons levelling up at high levels takes a lot of time and experience which can result in you getting to higher level areas while still being a lower level the game is still in the beta stage so it has more things to be before it can be extremely good and will have some bugs here and there overall i think it is a great game that will only keep getting better as time passes especially once it leaves the beta stage
never winter appears to be a good entry level massively multiplayer online role playing game for those who want to dip their toes into the dark dangerous waters i found the entry lvi zone full of people and couldn't find my display filters fast enough so many people selling end lvi gear and log shouts it could appear overwhelming for a first timer right click on the chat window and a check most of the options except tell whisper group
early access review recommend installing the few lbs this game has just so you can see how rubbish it is seriously you done need to look for much longer than five seconds to figure out this game is so bad that i am actually concerned for the people who leave positive reviews after playing more than five hours of this
early access review this game is awesome especially if you re a big fan of the adventure quest games works pretty well lots of planned content and the graphics look really nice on max and it runs so easily
a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make data two a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas mobs such as league of legend and data one of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero miranda and her trademark button ability sacred arrow which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not ltd moves in the game when not utilising this damage second stun players may take solace in mira as other special abilities such as leap a devastatingly evasive jump star storm a powerful are magical damage dealer and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on mira as team invisible at the click of a button whilst data two does not necessarily revolve around the ever popular hero miranda at this time many hope to one day see her in an online action adventure of her very oWn may
so here we are again out in the wilderness days gone by and your hard throbbing member has yet to be planted into some raw juicy rear you sit out in your scrawny little watch tower when suddenlybluarghthats it all you've been waiting for that one handsome and muscular call from the woods you take out your deer homo caller and let out one equally as homoerotic call hoping that it will react to it you patiently wait out those painstaking minutes which feel like hours you look through your binoculars and you see something something in the bush that int quite right its the antlers those big pointy and majestic antlers piercing through the foliage your nerves are going haywire your breathing is out of control but you manage to keep your binoculars steady as you focus on the beast it breaks through the foliage there is is muscular sweaty and musky stag just waiting to be plugged you stow your binoculars away as you approach the valiant beast every step you take towards it makes your heart beat faster and faster you can see it you can smell it you can feel it and there it is right in front of you just a stone toss away you re ready you've prepared your whole life for this your senses are going through the roof you reach into your pants unbuckle the strap whop out your throbbing and well greased gun you clear your mind slow down your breathing and take aim bang everything quiets down there you are right on top of it you stroke your hand over the fur and gently carcass the antlers after filling it up with your munition and just as you re about to pull out a mysterious man walks out of the woods and looks you straight in the eyes it has come to my attention that you've been dropping whitetail deer with a permitted ammo to hell with you doc
if you are looking for a solid game to sink countless hours into this is a great game otherwise maybe not so much it has an incredibly steep learning curve even for a mob but it is satisfying to master the community int the best but its not the worst either all in all its a good game after the first one hundred or so hours but its gonna be pretty frustrating until then
early access review before anyone says of its in early access you shouldn't judge it so harshly early access int armour for criticism plus in sure the people at artie have their big boy pants on and can take a criticism or two firstly why am i playing an androids massively multiplayer online on my personal computer at this point artie should have the money to make a decent three dimensional massively multiplayer online at least on the level and scale of world of war craft or guild wars two they may not be good examples but the point still stand so why are they making an massively multiplayer online for mobile devices granted its a lucrative market at this point but why then release it on personal computer they could have just released it on the play store and itunes released updates and just have it make money where it should secondly why does the game look terrible like it looks worse than run escape and that saying something i ask that question but then i remember they are making a mobile game for the personal computer its not stylised in a way that would hold up either it just generally looks bad like playstation one early days of polygon sprites bad finally and this can be pointed to it being in early access but there are lots of other early access games that passed this hurdle the game play is completely uninspired and pointless you have a total of five skills for each class and one of them is always the auto attack there is no variation to it and overall it leaves me bored in not expecting it to make any big waves but even the original adventure quest holds up better than this in conclusion its a boring ugly lame excuse for a personal computer port of what has been done several times over a hundred times better on mobile devices may
can only shoot two types of animal need to shoot other type of animals even using to unlock still need to renew license when the license expired need real to shoot pixel animal move along nothing to see here
early access review connecting to server is like in waiting for whole day damn it cant play this game i played adventure quest in my childhood now you ruined it but still its on beta so get you together artie
early access review all around amazing the game can be run on a potato personal computer just like mine and furthermore it has more features than any other battle royal this game allows the player to chose a class and that fits their own personal style the game does have its issues however as this is an alpha product all i can say is well done hire if you struggle to run footnote and fancy changing things up then give realm royal a chance if you like it then you like it and as of now it int filled with micro transactions so there are no features that allow players to have a higher advantage just because they paid for it lastly the controls a rent hard to use they are simple easy and fine the controller support is only partial but that still doesn't mean you cant plug in your controller and give it a go you be surprised at this game if you gave it a chance
early access review fractured space is the space game everyone wants needs and if they are smart has although very early in development it is extremely beautiful fun action packed but doesn't have the ability to link friends in games together which needs to be done in the next update if they want to keep players but in general its a fantastic game all of us gamers we have been waiting for
early access review this game about half a year ago i loved this game but since then it has been updated and it has been ruined one the developers has changed the maximum he well in theory this can be a good idea it has ruined the game you die in an instant you can get one shot with one of the base rifles in the torso you have under half the maximum he as before you get killed no matter what under a second i am not joking two there is no main menu you can either quit the game completely or log out only to to be stuck in the load out section without the ability change load out or customize character because the game thinks your in a match three no more casual domination its been removed you can no longer enter matches with low rank players without there being tanks planes or overpowered weapons you die you just die four first person shooter is when i played the game when it was good it had proper first person shooter but now its this game has been ruined what happened
no just no its pay to win could have been different but it doesn't work out sadly i was pumped for this game but in the end it was a disappointment and was hugely pay to win and the quests were bland the only good thing is that the community can make their own levels which are better than the actual games levels never winter is not a good game and i done recommend it
i didst really like the game when i first played it but it grew on me now in really enjoying it i done really understand why the reviews are mixed in usually pretty harsh on games but this one gets a recommendation from me its free to play so what do you have to lose besides your time
early access review you were the chosen one this was a unique fun take on the battle royal genre the class system the forges the chickens somehow they've managed to make the game worse with every update six man squads arbitrary weapon slots every other patch completely reworking the forge system players done drop their gear anymore this game just needed more content and some minor reworks for balancing only hope i could see is to reset to an earlier version and restart the early access process
i only have about two sentences why you should it play this the publisher kab am ruined it its complete pay to win this game used to kick kab am just really wants money and nothing else screw you kab am
this is a game that needs time to learn time to learn how to key bind time to learn how to start up an aircraft time to learn how to target enemies time to learn how to destroy them time to learn how to use countermeasures time to learn how to land then once you know those you need time to learn how to fly at night with night vision goggles on some aircraft you can be happy with the game without the need of a flight stick in or pedals they do add more to the enjoyment but if you can only use a controller this game still works with you if you done like learning how planes helicopters work i done recommend this for you if you take the time to learn it you will be rewarded with explosions and burning carcasses that were once your enemies take the time to learn the free but and you will see how fun it is to kill ground targets that is just a taste of how fun digital combat simulator can be
well its still bad it looks exactly the same as it did before weapons are easier to find so you might actually have some fun playing with friends but nothing seems to have changed from the original war a well they've implemented an anti duping system that makes it so that you cant pick up items dropped by someone that you've killed also the servers suck i got killed and couldn't join a single server had to restart the game and it still kept saying that i had an open session eventually i got back in but got did and game crashed is a new developer freda is are you sure its not just the same guys but a new company
i swear this game is the best game that has happened all year i was reluctant to buy the downloadable content at first but i ended up getting it and it changed my life you do not know what you re missing until you play this game with the downloadable content one hundred ten three
the card game everyone loves even when you get a brick hand welcome to steam duel links no more having to kill my phone battery to hours need grinding up the ladder in ranked now if i could just get that damn or i need out of the box for real though this is a really good mobile port and they made great use of the space available this game is quite addictive and i recommend it to any yugo fan on steam you can buy packs with real cash if you very well wish to however it is completely optional and its very easy to acquire the in game currency to buy said packs without putting any money into this game
when i first started playing in the beginner maps the game was fairly entertaining trying to build up a worthy character by finding rare weapons sniper rifles and upping the skill tree most other players were in the same boat i was in and were just trying to grind out sessions to make a better character with a handful of hackers everyone does shoot on site though because of the hackers even was shot by a player i gave a gun to with the gun i had just gave him her lesson learned trust no one then unfortunately i levelled up to where i was only allowed on the normal maps now live been one shot killed by assault rifles with heavy arm or on numerous times shot a guy at point blank with a log but still getting killed while the other player somehow still had one hundred health my point being if you get to the no beginner maps they are loaded with hackers and if you done run into hackers teams that all just maul any loner they find no longer even remotely worth my time anymore the deus seriously need to do a fix to reduce hacking and maybe put teams and single players on different servers i really do have high hopes for this game but until its fixed i cant recommend it
good game if you like creating with boxes there is some combat involved but depending the settings of the world you re in it can be minimal and easy which is not necessarily a bad thing you can easily play this without spending any real money but if you like it i imagine you'll probably get to the point where you want to spend a little its better to do that early in your experience with this game since you'll get more for your money early on even if you wait or never spend any of your hard earned funds this is still a good game for its genre and worth playing
awful physics and expensive content shame as i loved seven but sim in have nosedive with this if you can spend the money go with racing if not try asset to cora up actually get both and save yourself the download on this high end sim physics well they may seem good if you have never driven a car only positives i can find is the sound is pretty good of passable as long as you done use triple screens and it is free to try so i didst waste any money on it may
early access review not played a great deal to be honest the game seems pretty good i like the mechanics and the combat system biggest issue really is the wait times ten minutes between games is just not acceptable and i can much easily play another mob game that doesn't make me wait as long between matches i cant blame the game for that its obviously a small player base but due to this its kind of an endless loop no players long wait times less players longer wait times
product received for free early access review my friends and i started playing about two months before the update was just getting into it then they broke it now there is no more tiers and you get killed instantly by a dude with nine shotguns done play this game till its fixed you have been warned
honestly i see all these bad reviews and i cant help but look back on my days playing new before it hit steam was very fun until the deus saw a chance to make cash off players then i quit it used to be fun path exile mixed with wow was very nice graphics and super fun dungeon game play but i cant blame deus the need to keep the reputation of free to play mos alive money grabbing
live played this game for approximately one year now and i have to say it is much better than the original war it doesn't have hackers which was the major problem in the original game the loot is much better and it is significantly less pay to win i mean you are not paying any money to get the game and its only an option to buy premium you can still gather a large global inventory and get good weapons from playing on normal servers everything apart from certain skins you can farm normally without paying for premium the loot in this game is not scarce like the original the instant relieve character re spawn for premium doesn't effect too much due to you having a total of five characters you can use two characters to player versus player i think people are not giving this game the chance it deserves people are literally bandwagon in hate on this game due to it not being successful in the past int that what this game is an improvement from the original the final thing i would like to put out there is that the developers actually care about the community feedback unlike the developers of the original instalment whilst having great support
early access review a nice attempt to create a proper tag yet fails with bad design choices that enforce ring even more than needed mechanic wise i prefer the game over its competitors like hearth stone but a major issue that i have with this game is the way they designed the resource system why in the world would you want to have your resources in form of cards in your actual deck that poorly crafted design increases the ring that tags have to deal with even more than required cause not only do you have to make sure to draw the right cards you also have to make sure now to not draw resources if not needed and vice versa could be an amazing tag but fails due to a very stupidly designed fundamental mechanic
incredibly simple and easy to get into this is a game you can play for ten minutes and get plenty done done let perm death scare you it ends up feeling more like an arcade game than a traditional massively multiplayer online in that regard the time between starting the game and understanding whats going on is minutes long also its free and is twenty my get it and try it
played on arc downloaded not steam downloaded steam downloaded was giving me problems of not downloading all the files update this has not been updated to the new module four nerf the game is a lot more even now but in to lazy to completely edit review module five fixed a lot of awesome stuff games good but it get repetitive and really no good end game goal still fun game tho still to lazy just try the game i guess if a want know it says do not recommend but this game has an incredible story line its really good its a decent game except the game is all about which class you pick its not how long you spend playing the game its not exactly pay to win but paying can give you a big big boost giving you a big advantage against other players definitely big advantage the game is not really that great for me i mean i choose the class trickster rogue worst class ever i done even know why there is a class like this i wanted to role play or feel like a rogues spinning squish but massive damage that piles damage quick and is a fast class i was completely way way way way off the class is more of the squish looks like a ninjas pirogue that does above average damage with two second stealth and is a very slow moving character the tank class actually moves faster then the rogue class runs faster moves faster damages faster piles faster and int squishy the ranger class moves faster piles damage faster has ago eff doesn't hit higher but is way way faster when attacking which is stupid because a rogue is suppose to again pile damage fast and hit fast and hit hard which hesse does not so summary the game has a good story line terrible just awful cant emphasize this enough design of how the classes are so broken they make no sense tanks are fast with high def and fast attack rangers fast attack fast movement high def makers average movement average attack speed high damage output high def rogue class low def average movement speed a little bit above attack speed a little bit above average damage output this game is designed poorly on classes but incredibly on story you cant immerse yourself into it its just not that good

and ryan sixteen hundreds ghz i run this game with this hardware force gtd go ram game looks beautiful although some parts may look outdated it does take away from the massively multiplayer online shooter exp best stopping points are when you win a battle dominated an are and time installing and live gotten over the hard parts of this game yes you are gonna die a lot but that is because you are a no new player like any other game you need to learn the ropes best feeling i get from this game is when i run infiltrator and do a hard flank and kill three or four guys it feels good because at most of the times i am surrounded by the enemy which is inst death if you are not inf may

some technical issues and banned my child from using it world of tanks asked me to follow some steps but didst work disappointing for a kid to play and suddenly ban stay away from this game
alright ladies and gentlemen time you tell you a decently okay story review of realm of the mad god now before we begin i would just like to say somethings this game is perm death but you can keep some of your items if they are in your vault done be deceived by my measly thirty play hours i probably had a this amount before i started playing through steam and not the room website pro very entertaining simple learning curve if your new to the genre fun community and you make friends quite easily controls are simple yet perfect high replay value any different classes to choose from with there own unique items and skills you get to run in hordes of players you done even know exploring a dungeon and i mean tons of people heres a server specifically for trading fun playing solo or with friend depending on how you view it very rewarding but also very punishing permanent extremely fun boss fights i mean legit your fighting a giant in puppet that like hello overpowered with you fifty people and the fight still takes a couple minutes money all they want is your money basically your bombarded with ads and deals every time you open the game also the hub is legit full of items to buy but cost like one hundred and fifteen even though you can easily with the right tools earn them in game done worry you done need to buy these items at all spend money in general but one thing id recommend buying if you enjoy the game is the new player starter pack to sum it up new players have seven days one week to buy this starter pack or you wont get the offer ever again its definitely worth getting it its twenty but if you were to buy all the items vault chest coins each it would cost you around eighty so its worth a buy the game was abandoned the developers do not update the game anymore so no new content will be added to the game scammers but wait you just said room had a great comm shut up i know what i said and it really does have a great community but everyday more and more scammers come to the game so it gets a little hard to trade with someone when your like ill give you eight defence pots for one life pot and they re like nah dude big scam big scam you give me sixteen def pots and ill give you two mana pots like that gay but overall if you are planning to spend money on this game i done recommend it but if you are going to free to play this game like it was originally supposed to be sure give this game a quick try
early access review ont loose your time playing this game its pretty good till you get third rank after third rank there will be hundreds thousands of donation imbalance tanks weapons it center and till fifteen rank you could have shit fucking rifle that kills in three or four shots forget about balance and fairness that not about this game is if your mon gives you more than four for meal per day and you done want to spend it for something more useful you could donate it and lick deus as a
early access review do not purchase this game until its fixed the frame rate is garbage despite the graphics not justifying it it has issues with servers because be wiz idiotically thought they only need one server at launch instead of six now they re locking people out of making characters on certain servers to handle the overpopulation how is that a reasonable fix what if half your friends got in on day one and made characters and played until higher level and now you cant make your character what even is the point of the head start if you cant actually play the head start or if you lose your head start because you have to switch to a server your friends can actually make characters on ill re review this game later upon them fixing the current glaring issues until now i would suggest absolutely nobody buy this game
early access review the status of the game is pretty much at or alpha so done bother installing it at least for now you should have put all the required game files on the steam server when the game download finishes from steam it starts downloading another half a gigabyte which by the way is so broken so at first it downloaded some three thousand and forty my then it said the launcher is updated and i should restart it after doing that it doesn't download anything downloading files bullshit eta two the game launcher has issues with user interface at the top right a white square randomly appears from nowhere overlaying the close minimize and settings buttons disable seeding by default people want a game not a torrent client emf if i ever make it to the game by some miracle i will try to update this review
early access review ill try to not regurgitate i plan on playing this for awhile despite the negative review hoping that it gets better somewhat i would say that this game int on the level of other available mos even with all of its performance issues resolved however performance this is a bad release maybe the worse live seen on a release i would like to add to the already abundant complaints on this that i believe most of these could be positive reviews or at least delayed until people reached late game if the performance issues were not as bad as they currently are i think it would be worth checking out recent reviews later if the studio actually invests the effort in fixing this issue quality of life you cant trade between your own characters even premium currency is bound to a single character which is stuck on a character that i was going to switch off the user interface is clean but not very custom table mouse binds are not a thing financial concerns a costume is twenty six hundreds lumens which is a little more that twenty us you can almost get one lumina from a low level dungeon run which means if you ran a low level dungeon twenty six hundreds times you could get a costume that way you can also get a couple thirteen lumina from killing players almost nothing is bound to account meaning you might have to make purchases multiple time compared to other mos i done know how this game will make money the cash shop is overpriced encouraging players to stay away from it there no subscription poor reviews will drive down sales live purchased lumens from the game that i have never received money into the ether poor customization the skill tree has some very easy decisions where it would be foolish to go the other way chaining abilities a rent nice it limits what you can do when compared to wow where you might have a skill rotation that is optimal this makes it bread and butter by force and makes skill availability in player versus player a thing of luck sometimes it demands static rotations in dynamic situations
early access review think of it like this germans advanced warfare a a couple of kids having a birthday party at a paintball arena uneven teams easily spawn trapped weak guns if you re a low level buggy edit did i mention it was pay to win i didst mention it was pay to win
how to easily beat people on assault mode they re using ninja and wizard probably bring a cobra and spam blood adjustment bring farm and dart monkey too on water maps its good to have a water tower
the simplicity of the game is what makes the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and i cannot tell you how much fun it is to learn how to play each class when i first branded out into other classes for real was when man versus machine came out and i was practically forced to play other roles to support the team and at that point its when i realized i had love for more than just the sniper and spy and i could learn to enjoy all the other classes too there always something of each class everybody can enjoy maybe not everybody but why do i hate this game even though i gave it a good rating the fact that this game is slowly dying and to me it seems like valve seems to care less and less about team fortress two and just scrap up community maps for new updates and shove in skins and try to squeeze as much money as they can the last update want terrible it had me playing for a couple more hours but it want enough to bring me back to the good old days not only that but the prices of trading only increase and never seem to stabilize and constantly fluctuate which makes trading dead unless you have usual on you but why bother leaving a good review you might ask because the only thing that team fortress two seems to do right compared to every other game out there in the market is that no matter how much i hate this game get bored of it and realize how its dying every month or so i will eventually come back to it anyway the game is amazing and i cant deny it even if i wanted to old i in hate this game but you should definitely still play it because i love it would definitely get stabbed by a spy again
let me be clear this game takes some serious getting used to you will be lost for the first several hours and even after that figuring out how you fit into your teams overall objective is going to be difficult i had the major benefit of joining a platoon a group of squads and squad leaders working together under the command of a platoon leader early on and doing so went a long way towards helping me understand how to play the game well as an individual you must decide what role you want to fill in the game and how it can best benefit your team this means picking a class and sticking to it for the most part for those of you who think immediately i want to snipe some words of caution you will be killed counter sniped and pushed around a lot in the beginning your kill count will be low and firefights will be overwhelming the scope of this game is massive and unlike a certain overly popular gaming franchise on console cough cod cough just because you have a sniper rifle doesn't mean you re going to be a headhunting god out the gate battlefield see bullet drop and highly limited breath holding capabilities will see to that you will likely be outperformed by hardcovers if you try to play the quick scope game here long weapon re chamber and reload times will ensure that why because this game does not feel that every soldier on the battlefield is equal head shots cannot kill every target in one hit especially depending on the rifle you use with a fair few requiring two or more hits to kill regardless of where you hit your target at a range beyond four hundred meters only the highest powered weapons will drop targets in one shot only one faction specific weapon has the damage output to head shot most targets in one hit at any range downside it has a trigger delay and that will throw your shots way off target starting to sound unfair welcome to planet side where every faction has very distinct pros and cons to its equipment sets and abilities for those of you who prefer to be in the thick of the fight prepare to be outflanked double teamed and owned by vehicles in mass your cd is going to hurt in the beginning no two automatic weapons are equal in any way find one that works well for you and stick to it with all of this said this game is not newbie friendly veteran players will have a more diverse set of weapons better implants and know many of the nooks and crannies you might try to hide in advantage being the layout of each continent has changed a few times over the years so there are plenty of spots yet to be used frequently this game is somewhat pay to win allowing you to use real money to get that shiny new weapon a lot faster however with the exception of a few differently coloured weapon iterations whose stats are exactly the same as the base model nothing in this game is unobtainable by simply playing the game but it is a grind as is every massively multiplayer online ever made still sound like your kind of challenge welcome to the battle for aura is pick your side pick your guns and strap yourself in you a rent in kansas anymore
this is the best hunting game i have played but the free to play model is actually a demo version if you want to truly enjoy this game then you will have to spend lots money into it i expected it to be something like the valve games free to play pay games custom skins for guns pay for guns custom player models and stuff that doesn't affect the game play that much but its not and i am sure that it will have more players if it would be you have to pay monthly if you want to hunt other animals and pretty much do everything what this game has to offer cannot recommend sadly because its a very good game i hope the developer publishers change their methods cannot recommend it to anyone except if you want to just hunt a little bit the few animals you are allowed to hunt or you want to pay monthly for it
early access review its a big mtg ripoff with a far worse mulligan rule and a bloated thirteen power card requirement and seventy five card minimum deck size a knockoff with worse mechanics and in getting to the point on this game where i think it intentionally screws me like its my turn to lose ten games in a row from mana screw flood feels like a big game of paper rock scissors and a complete waste of my time this game angers me more than anything else in my life i just feel cheated constantly sometimes it just seems like your opponent has just been scripted to have answers to everything you draw because statistically it was their time to win and the art is really bad and i done care about the lore at all and forget about ranked mode if you haven spent all of your allowance on this game so you can get all the legendary cards unlocked you re gonna have a bad time really in done with this garbage
such a fantastic mob you will love every minute of the complex well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into defiantly not pay to win the reason why i said you shouldn't play this game is because of the community everyone is a jerk lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing so they blame everyone els on the team this is almost every game these people make it incredibly hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesn't help the team in any way is yelling at you its just amazing how horrible people are at this game but are quick to judge my suggestion is to skip this game because what ever time place or day you decide to get on to play this beautiful game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood the only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you if you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesn't want to help you or the team again a fantastic mob it is just littered with its community
early access review have played this game for a while and i must say its so much fun with friend pros pretty graphics it is always updated with new legends not pit has a few different modes to playmate to destroy friendships if you ever had any cons frustrating when you play in online against waylay better players or spammers still miss my friends tough eight hundred and ten
despite my lack of experience i have found planet side two to be a very balanced and entertaining mops re spawns are short you can pick your battles and even new players can take on veterans if they know what they re doing air vehicles are hard to control and the map can sometimes be confusing but overall a great game to invest your time in
early access review fractured space has a great deal of depth and tactical complexity a new player can pick up the basic mouse keyboard commands after a few matches and yet a one hundred hour veteran can still find new tricks and tactics the recent change for ship acquisition makes the grind for new ships very manageable new players can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ships while leaving a few more expensive and newer ships as goals to pursue the only purchasable elements are purely cosmetic or means to bypass some of the unlock grind despite some reviews here this game is absolutely not pay town the design team is very active in releasing new updates to the game while some bugs and significant ship balance issues remain as is typical for an alpha stage game the updates have largely been incrementally improving the game for the past zealand half key features deep tactically spaceship combat beautiful visuals esp for an alpha manageable unlock rate no pts elements active development team weaknesses some server lag and stability issues growing but currently limited player base ship balance still a try it today fractured space boasts massive spaceships looks great and its free there nothing to lose and the game continues to grow improve and evolve with every update
good game but the deus have certainly gave up on the game which is a shame you get people using the same strategies over and over because they are overpowered and it gets boring some towers are really good and some are awful it is a shame because the game would be a lot better if everyone had their own personal favourite towers which they used and things like that
so i quit for awhile and all my friends had told me not to come back because it became even more pay to play well i didst listen to pm because in stubborn as hell and i saw they added magpie geese today i was super excited then i saw how much the whole setup costed and said forget that so i found a server finally with a setup and in like cool ill shoot a few and ill be happy so i bought a flag and lone behold i got four flocks to break super happy till i realized these things art like the canadian geese or the mallards they will literally land a mile away from you if you done have a short range caller so with that being said and after all the money live put into this game i sure hope call of the wild adds birds because i will no longer support this game and their greedy ambitions sad it honestly was such a good game not saying there want micro transactions but this is honestly ridiculous twenty seven for a full setup for one bird you guys are nuts done play this game if you wanna shoot waterfowl wait instill call of the wild adds it and buy that and with how they release updates that all be a year or two because they re more worried about the console updates atm
is a very fun game its an interesting exploring game very beautiful and guess what its free if you like min craft you will like this game the art is beautiful the game play is great no actual story but no one wants one free server hosting honestly you should try this game
has absolutely no support for this game the support website requires you to sign up too game crashes often as well also you loose any items you use like event tickets when it crashes uninstalling
excellent car sounds physics as far as i can tell for free content nice interface as well most settings are easy to find but some like for seems harder to find ghost cars and racing lines sometimes done work yes i do not know the made up tracks some bugs on the free maps are the tyres warm or not done have any indication except for four tyres at the bottom most cars seem to be planted on the road red bull ring track seems mostly flat leg no bumps when driving less visual and road details on off track compared to asset to cor as red bull ring free content is good hey its free love the hill climb map the micro transaction model is a big no no for me however one for being able to test cars before you purchase them i recommend trying out this product if it fits your needs
early access review brainless fun like call of duty some guns need balance changes mostly damage checks the maps live played so far are the bane of my existence but i didst download expecting much play if you want to kill time
an massively multiplayer online role playing game like min craft game play that you can fish sail in the sea ride a different mount enter dungeons trade with players fly in the sky craft items build your own club it center the problem of this game is that when you check your ping by typing in game debug text its really lag it takes time to load the terrain sometimes fast even thou you are lag it is still playable you just get lag teleworking from one place to another
running simulator pros zombies are easy to kill plenty of weapons to find ont die of hunger currently player count is surprisingly high cons barely any zombie or player interaction so you are basically alone the whole time confusing server joining and men stamina is so low for how far you have to run zombies suck at killing you weapon spam makes any noon able to kill even an experienced player i got three player kills and two zombie kills in the first fifteen minutes of playing the game horrible graphics and textures
after two thousand hours of playing this game i still cant get enough egg has to be one of the best if not the best game developers out there they've done such a great job with this game if you like grinding games for better loot this is for you if you re new to this genre you re gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game its definitely a lot to take in as a new player but once you've figured it out it becomes so addicting there new leagues implemented every thirty four months which allows for fresh economies new aspects to the game its my favourite part the deus are constantly updating balancing the passive tree which is freaking amazing so you shouldn't get to in love with any given play styles build if you re new definitely follow some of the big streamers so you can stay up to date on decent builds to use for new leagues there tons more i can say but ill leave it here download poe and have fun grinding
steam reported hours the of my playtime standalone launcher used mostly all in all an incredible implementation of the do universe all fans will be thrilled especially with dragon fights org loads of content stunning environments easy to learn yet hard to master meaning you can simply mash your way through as a dumb hero or become a god if you apply yourself and an role playing game well worth putting time into the amount of content and weeks of game time provided in the free to play model is incredible the voice acting is world class and the quests vary from profound to wonderfully ridiculous if you then choose after finally completing all of the story content which is immense to then push for the end game content or player versus player you can attain equal footing through some grinding which is still fun in a group or you can go ahead and pay the people who gave you this all for free and continue to play with the grinding aspect lowered at that level alternatively there are regular events all grand fun and many other dungeons you can immerse yourself in without end game gear and have a fantastic time just exploring all the locations properly or socialising in one of the very many highly active guilds people complaining about pay to win must get off their high horse as i fail to see how they expect servers to magically stay active and fresh content in this games case pretty much monthly appear without the programmers getting paid servers need upkeep designers need to feed themselves and coders need their coffee people free to play models are essentially an involved extended demo these days mho and if you like it buy it
early access review trying to play and apparently there is no sea server yet probably playing with approx three hundred is ping tried to win my game with constant teleportation hit a guy once and get shot three times ate lots of stuff got my first mark three helmet happily played with one thousand one hundred and forty two first person shooter and sudden drop into sixty six first person shooter and when its ten people left it crashed cant get mad because it is free will not recommend this to any sea player yet probably but the graphic is good
what the hell did they do to this game i sued to be able to run this game on this machine just fine with pretty much no lag now when i can get the game running without it crashing which seems to be random its just a saggy mess from start to finish its so bad its not even playable for me anymore and i used to play this game all the time on this machine whf happened
early access review this is basically malware its fun yes but it behaves exactly like malware installs some dodgy torrent it uses to update seeds the torrent on its own auto starts itself and update doesn't delete when its uninstalled this game constantly updating in the background even when live tried to disable it caused me to have latency issues beyond belief for any game i play on my system not worth it boys
early access review this is awful my friend can play the game no issue at all i just got a fourteen hour premium and i cant go on the game it says that it is a server error sort yourselves the out deus
so a test game ever try joining a server disconnected second attempt disconnected third attempt disconnected fourth attempt waiting the game to loads forever disconnected again would get cancer
this game gives me power of unimaginable force with the strength i receive i shall be able to become the true take done play this game its weird and lovely at the same time
in giving this a recommend because it seem fairly competently put together and from my few hours playing it i didst run into anything awkward obviously comparisons to min craft are hard to avoid my first impression is that its like a simplified version of min craft with some other changes the most noticeable difference in my opinion is that its far more visually attractive the monsters are far more interesting your character actually looks like a person and all of the blocks look like they came with one of those fancy texture add on from the start it also has teleworkers which i like a lot it doesn't have hunger or levels or enchanting or anything like that as far as i can tell the lack of hunger is sort of nice and your character can jump real good which means you can mine and get around without it constantly being an ordeal its a free to play game obviously so there a lot of tailoring intending to get you to by pro version which is a one time buy of twenty dollars also there is apparently some kind of coin system where you can buy redesigned structures to build which honestly sort of confuses me because what is the point of the game then you can also buy all kinds of in game items with micro transactions which starts seeming like a bit much it feels very polished but at the same time its true their particular method of encouraging you to go pro is kind of annoying i have no problem with micro transactions in otherwise free games but i hate it when those micro transactions are just flat out buying items that should be getting crafted in game and that layered on top of the pro version is weird because that means they ultimately want you to both buy the pro version and buy these random item packs like maybe give me more cosmetic options instead or something id maybe its because in just sick of min craft in general but after getting myself set up i didst see much need to progress any further it doesn't feel like it has a lot of options over all and if you've already got the build a house out of blocks thing out of your system it doesn't feel like from a glance that this game is offering anything very fresh in that regard in summary there are a lot of user interface things and aesthetics that are way better than min craft but mechanically its not very exciting also there doesn't seem to be any ranged weapons whats with that
campers campers and more campers everywhere i am a fan of zombie movies or serials but this game is not even close to show the player a real zombie infested world where you have to survive the worst thing you have to survive are the bunch of campers who will use everything and every trick at their disposal to far kill or camp you its more like a player survival not zombie
pros if you enjoy hated you will love this game i wish they made games like this for all my fandoms it takes a long time to finish all the quests and when you do there are in game expansion packs that add on even more they have pretty much every single dragon ever mentioned in the movies shows cons there are so many glitches it can get annoying but if you go on their website and look at bug complaints other people have had the same problems and have found ways around it overall it is a fun game and its free so why even hesitate if you done like it you can just erase it
this game is the best game you can get for free it fun intense and you enjoy with friend if it was a star rating i would give it a five star rate it is beauty full in graphic and how it looks it a bad game there to much to explain that why you must get it
good game with good longevity the server access aka ping on the asia server best for new zealand is given that this game requires the odd in app purchase to avoid endless monotony that is frankly unacceptable and i is not the no based isis issue
laugh out loud opened the game joined a server because i couldn't create one without a membership got into the game had really confusing controls with awful movement mechanics than i walked around got a road scoped in saw a fox tried to shoot it and a popup appeared saying i couldn't as i didst have the right license closed the game and now in writing this review its garbage
this game is so great you can simulate the entire latvian air force step one get in four i helicopters step two somehow damage one of them step three never repair the damaged helicopter step four be left with three helicopters step five wait for nat to help you
had a blast in this game over the couple years live played i know the hours done seem to show it either game can be a bit grind at times but if you grab a buddy for the ride can be good fun
i had not placed any flight sim games in some years until last week my friend was talking about digital combat simulator and being free i figured id give it a try hands down the best flight sim i have ever placed and it has brought back the love i have for aviation i will say however it is not for those who want the casual flying of a jumbo jet or island hopper even the simplified planes require a good amount of practice with and tweaking of controls to fly well and operate well in combat the full sim planes are a blast to figure out and when you get it right you feel like you accomplished something the simple planes give you the ability to get into combat faster since you do not have to spend all your time just getting an engine started or maintaining settings while in flight if you are looking for a real combat flight sim this is it its just plane awesome
this game was actually quite fun in my opinion the problem with a lot of people is they done realize that there is a free rotation of what you can kill each week without paying i however played for one hour and managed to kill two dears all while free to play and honestly i enjoyed following the tracks and backtracking when i got lost on the trail it was quite realistic and the game looks absolutely beautiful its a yes from me guys keep it up
ask simulator ask heaven whole team ask but jokes aside this game needs to do something about afters that sometimes can be your whole team everything else is mostly good except for matchmaking which quite awful at times and puts in impossible situations and game turns into a one shot central and that why its such a shame to see this game getting utterly ruined by the vast number of ask players in loosing interest to play this game because of that and cant recommend anyone to play this ask simulator one other issue i found out is the massive flaw in matchmaking game puts up teams that are heavily underpowered against a much higher tier setup in this scenario enemy tanks are basically invincible and everyone just sits back in spawn and wait for the game to end
what the hell guys i thought you guys wanted world of tanks without arty here you are complaining why cause its not what we wanted since its the wrong one hey you guys do know that wot personal computer big wot the one on world tanks com not baby wot blitzes a huge be file like gas i think maybe i dunno i done care all i know is that its a good game in not looking at this like of for shame on you we we wanted wot on steam this is how you pay us with wot blitz unacceptable if your like that fine go play world of tanks but world of tanks blitz is different they both do great at what they want to portrait here wot big wot is great at realism while wot baby wot is good for those who have a terrible computer still want the world of tanks experience in my opinion they are both different games you cant say that one is worse that the other cause one of them is original a mobile game and done say that wot big wot is a saint cause your wrong they both have their flaws their strengths but they also have different audiences world of tanks blitz is for people who done like the console version but yet still wants a competitive yet fair playing field in a quick matter while wot the one that everybody is saying that you should go download instead is for those who want to play a game that is a bit more detailed historical driven but pretty is much the same limo i mean mon your still shooting enemy tanks if you do damage credits experience points come out
its just button mash the game so if you like breaking your a and a key to win at the game will this game is for you and if you like easy as games this is also for you and on top of that your player is so edgy as players well you came to the right place and in not saying it bad and in also not saying it good so yeah give it a try is its a pay to win as well so if you like taking money from your mon or dad to buy go right a head and make your player even more edgy then it already is
early access reviewing played twenty five hours and i can safely say that this game is great and its only getting better if you are on the fence about buying this you should totally do it because once you get past the tier one ships it becomes really fun the sniper is a fantastic ship in particular and one of my personal favourites once you get past the learning curve there is a ton of game play and lots of fun to be had
every time i get on the game is glitches it says that steam needs to be opened even though it is and the game wont start have to reinstall it every time done waste you re time with this
early access review pretty good game same concept as pub and footnote its very high quality game with good mechanics and controls and its free hopefully the developers behind this game will keep on updating it and not make it a pay to win game very solid game
this game is a pretty awesome game if you liked world of war craft you will like this game it takes some time getting used to after other morphs but once you re into it its really fun and way better that wow you get so much content for free and the game is awesome of course there are micro transactions but you should just ignore them the game is free they need something to make money of overall i advise anyone to try this game out for themselves
it been a good game so far who said old games suck graphics are old but that normal i like it heres a little tip if you spend one dollar euro on this game your experience will be better
its free that always good right play it have fun fall in love just like a gold digging girlfriend this game screws you over the moment you spend money on it i spent one hundred and eighty i thought i bought it but no i go back into the game and it still tells me i have to buy all the tracks and all the cars so in just wondering whf did i just spend one hundred and eighty on the least it could do is give me a blow job play the free part its actually fun spend the money and regret it
pm hole co of the company something about the free play model of experiencing video games has always rubbed me the wrong way with free play you can to be too aggressive with monetization the game is full of bugs and is a massive cash grab
infestation
finally a game for people like us to enjoy put aside your copy of me in camp turn off the imported tortures at porn movie from japan that you re watching close the skylight curtains to your basement flat and obsess over the assembly and disassembly of a wide variety of firearms for hours hopefully they'll release downloadable content where we can repeatedly enact shooting people before chopping them up and storing their body parts in the fridge one thousand and ten would masturbate again
this is a very combo focused game there is a limit to how many hits you can land consecutively so you'll have to figure out what sequence of attacks work well for you to deal as much damage during your combo perhaps my favourite aspect of the game and maybe the only reason i play it is the player versus player arena its fun to play against others and you may meet some new friends or build up hate towards each other during player versus player you can play in one versus ones two versus twos or is just two versus two matches get hectic so you can only imagine how insane is can get there are also fields for you to level up in and dungeons to do with auto selected parties or with your own party of people the story quests are keen on making you repeat the same dungeons however it gets a little less repetitive later on though that might just be me getting used to doing the same one dungeon over and over all in all the only thing keeping this game fun to me is the player versus player aspect May
early access review this game was a fun game to play with my friends but after the new updates the game has set me further away from where i was before it used to be to be a tank an you had to be level three and for a pilot level four but now it is to be a tank an you have to be level five and to be a fighter pilot level six so now i have to grind even more to get to the same point as i was before done bother to play this because all it does is mess a about and annoy you
i downloaded this game not because in familiar with how to train your dragon but because the description reminded me of a game i haunt played in nearly two decades call dragon seeds for the playstation one i came into this not even thinking that it was possible for a game to be released nowadays with graphics that are on par with a sixteen year old game not to mention this pay system twenty minutes into the game and you'll already have a large flashing button on the user interface telling you that you have ten days to pay for a starter pack and that not even the first thing behind gems you come in contact with when you have to pick an egg for your future dragon the ones not even two steps away from where you start are locked for members only you want a cool dragon five please you want to skip the tutorial five please you want to have a second character slot membership please you want a third character more money please fourth cash fifth even more molar
early access review in its current early access alpha stage i think this game is very nice looking and fun obviously it could use balancing and fixes and stuff since its alpha early access but its fairly good so far very interesting and varied ship designs with nice themes based on factions if you re interested in graphics then you might like the fact that the game looks very good even on low settings although i will say the station models could use work not that its much of a problem though since you re usually shooting other ships as for game play its good that there are a somewhat wide variety of abilities and strategies based on the ships you use the unlocking system doesn't feel like it takes too long although it be nice if getting credits was just a bit faster the premium currency doesn't over saturate the game either which is a plus they done shove it down your throat like other games also i might be a tad biased because i got the game for free props to these guys for the free weekend that let me keep the game three
early access reviewing been playing this game on and off from the day it came out with this latest update they reset all ribbon progress that means all the hours put into this game were completely wasted uninstalling this game as we speak after all the posts on their forums they have clearly stated they done care and are happy to see players leave in done here as much as it pains me to say this done bother with this game it was fun back in the day but the developers will clearly do anything they can to make you send them actual money again go play another game if you value your time as the developers clearly do not
the elder scroll legends game steals shamelessly from hearthstone and this makes it a good game where it is unique from hearthstone it is gimmicky but those places are few and far between the pros if you play hearthstone you already know how to play how to get around and how to win it is shiny and beautiful with better voice acting than the a a elders rolls games i know not saying much it has more modes and game types than hearthstone the most important pro to me it is still a manageable size i left hearthstone behind because it was a bloated complicated mess with more content dumped on top weekly this is currently a great size and as a new game there is less of a pro user base to kick me down realtor blythe cons the artificial intelligence although fun to play is fairly weak it makes clumsy decisions frequently it steals almost everything from hearthstone and comes across as an a mature effort because of that i mean it steals everything there is a heavy imbalance towards going second the triple gem ring keeps you tight on curve and makes it hard to lose we shall see i am eight hours in and i done even have that much time for games any more
pay to win cant win against deck full of legendary overpowered cards fun mechanics though too bad the balance is so poor if there would be limit like two legendary cards in a deck it would be a lot more balanced but there are no sane limits to amount of legendary or epic cards in deck by the time i write this review i played twenty hours on steam and around the same on mobile its great till you start playing ranked and get thrown against full legendary decks at rank look at this legendary tips wow legend decks look at this common tips wow legend decks the difference
my personal favourite arg the levelling system is expansive allowing for a range of builds naturally varying from the obscene and the useless up to the content destroyers featuring a great community and a fantastic development team who are constantly trying to fix issues and interacting with their player base with huge updates every year adding new content furthermore the unique items which are rare item drops that have special properties are actually interesting and can even define new builds some are better suited for levelling but others add new mechanics that beautifully combine with the other skills available in the game and to top it all off it is free to play the game does feature micro transactions mainly purely cosmetic however it is definitely worth putting in a small bit of money to purchase additional stash tabs to relief some of the constant inventory management especially if you have a tendency to hoard everything nothing can be bought which will improve your character so no pay to win elements
not really sure why everyone is so negative about this game it is free for fucks sake yes i agree it int one thousand and ten gaming masterpiece but it also int three thousand and sixty like the one thousand and ten games are does it have some glitches sure look at my play time it has crashed maybe twice crashing is not as big of a problem as people would have you believe is it missing some features that other games have of course but for a free game it runs well it has enough features and is generally fun enough to justify the purchase of free
early access review game was perfect for me are epic fail loot patch now its just like a gambling game with more action was planning to buy premium but nash cons you cant earn in game currency unless you recycle worthless parts for thirty of their value when you buy them freeway am forcing us to pay for premium so we could earn more parts per crate before epic fail loot update you can do fine without premium loot drops they give still give parts like cubes and such even after the rhesus fix your team will most likely win if you have the most advanced weapons i a homing misses shotguns that stealth device which i forgot what its called pros fun game addictive that feeling of my robot will be better than other peoples robot feel you can build anything you want from tanks to planes will stop playing rob craft until pay am fixes the game if not then i will wait for that game similar to rob craft but more gritty called crosscut
pros spiritual successor of diabolo ii visuals art style atmosphere user interface level design and so on perfect free play scheme with zero pay town elements real money can be used to purchase cosmetic items only unique and interesting skill tree loots cons unfriendly for casuals inevitable re rolls due to complicated and unforgiving min max builds obnoxiously frequent desk flag issues production value final remarks all is and arg fans should take a look at path of exile recommended
early access review great game ninety nine except tom maps are way by to small grenades are way by to of sniper scope sens needs to be separate to how sight sens needs to be an oceania region
early access review the biggest gay only for gays like me can we hit ten thousand likes for ninja and his recovery from sigma any
i love it i play it way more then any of the games live payed for sure its grind as heck as many players exploit factions strong point but come on who doesn't exploit a game for a bit every once in a while but it is still a great game servers can suck but maybe that just australia cd i recommend to anyone who likes a bit of a grind and a good war game
to honestly this card game kicks especially if you have played enough of a any elder scrolls games and you understand what the cards are based on and such fun game play its free and live never spent any real money and still got a really cool deck easy to get coins and is just a fun game i had way more hours on the bethesda launcher but i scrapped it for the steam launcher to not have a dumb as a launcher for one game with a magic a cost of eleven
i find fallout shelter to be an amazing game just done use your money to buy anything like ever i spent thirty on my game and had weapons for everyone everything was perfect then out of nowhere invincible mol rats overran my shelter i paused and googled if paid for objects and such carried out between saves but sadly they did not i wasted thirty on this game just so i could be easily overran it was basically like me spending two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine for the game but once you lost you lost the game too this is the only reason i do not recommend this game i strongly disapprove that they be locked to specific saves especially considering the fact i spent my hard earned real money of you lost thanks for playing please insert another its like a sick overly expensive arcade machine that instead of quarters costs two thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and you done get three lives nope just one lose it and you have to pay an arm and a leg just to start over this happened a couple months or so ago but just now decided to rate it final conclusion if you play this do not spend any of your money on this otherwise a great game
early access review all free to play card games have a catch this game is the shifts one dust dust a common card gives one one shifts one you need thirty two hundreds shift stones to craft one legendary in other words this game has tons of useless cards it wastes peoples time to look at mho all cards should be useful and interesting
eight hundred and ten the ideology behind this game is similar to min craft yet the core game play is much different than min craft i thoroughly enjoyed playing it with all my friends and we play it for hours on a regular basis the only reason this int one thousand and ten is because i keep getting dropped frames maybe add an option to reduce them i know several other games that have options to help keep a stable frame rate and it would be great if this one became one of them would definitely consider buying the pro version just done have the money yet
early access review its an alright game graphics are pretty good and the game play would be awesome except you go into a queue where you are matched with others to form a squad and have to keep waiting for timers to count down for the game to start holding the base is a great idea but there are no real directions on how to move around when starting out so you have to build up your accuracy over time and end up going through the meat grinder a lot
calling it free to play is pretty deer hit since the free part is really limited try if you even like the game deal you can only hunt rabbit and one type of deer but for this game the forty euros for a year of licence is not bad and you get loads of stuff with it and if you buy something with money like new guns and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumables and just buy the types of guns to suit your hunting style and your fine also the ammo replenish after hunts so you only need a case or two because the yearly subscription fee is not that big and you get loads of stuff with it i think it is actually pretty fair just done expect to do much without paying and yes if you like hunting and the game the developer fully deserve your money best hunting simulator since deer hunter series and i played that for hours and hours but it is definitely not for everyone but playing this with friends or even sometimes with some random people online is tons of fun it really shines in multiplayer
has a few nice elements but overall quite boring and repetitive music and sounds free things popping up at the start then i just got used to it some visuals humour repetitive going through sixty boring rooms and then getting killed out of nowhere waste of time story movement cant slide on edges blocks your movement monsters jumping out of nowhere and killing you overall five hundred and ten
digital combat simulator world is a great hardcore combat flight sim with a crazy amount of detail and i love it for that but something about the game doesn't feel the same as in nineteen forty is or strike fighters two i think it comes down to a few things with me one content is lacking compared to in and of the game feels a little bare bones with its selection of aircraft yes the detail is much higher in digital combat simulator but i would rather see eagle dynamics come out with more playable aircraft if it means dropping the detail to that of pc no middle ground its full sim or nothing in digital combat simulator and that fine but tbs i like the way in and of handle sims and having the option just to set things as easy or as hard as i want sometimes i just want to blows up without going though the hassle three mod support this leads back to the issue of not having a wide selection of aircraft in digital combat simulator and its far from having any type of mod library that gets close to in or of price of downloadable content now in no stranger to paying for downloadable content on a simulator god knows i spent a lot in train simulator but that the thing for me it comes down to why pay when i can get a mod for of if they lowered the cost i wouldn't mind picking put more then what i have but at fifty i find it hard to justify getting one digital combat simulator world is a great sim but is it on my favourites list no it doesn't have the aircraft i like and it doesn't give me the same joy and game play experience that i look for in a sim seven hundred and ten
this is a really solid card game that takes many ideas of similar games and combines all the best parts wile keeping most of the bad stuff out that being said conscription the last nerf is negligible for galvani conscription because of all the ramp in those color and why did you nerf ash berserker would recommend
best part of this game was when they released the bicycle hama now i done even have it installed and when that came out it want even close to being on here and the american came laugh out loud give me a break only came was the frog came almost had the my then it went to pay to own no more no thanks i am done it was fun when it was first released outside of steam now no
they give you a lot of cards for playing yes do any of those cards ever go in your deck no can you scrap them to make a card you actually want yes that is if you re willing to scrap a whole booster to make a rare you need a and cant get out of a booster because they wont give you a pack from a set that actually matters for your deck why not just buy a booster of but its a waste compared to spending the in game currency on a forge or draft not that you should bother with a forge you basically play draft mode against bots that have reconstructed decks its almost fun until you win a few and now the mix of picking semi random cards and the fact that the artificial intelligence level has been increased they re deck just starts working better and better you will lose because you drew two six power in a row while they lay down legend aries you wish the randomness of the forge had granted you an answer to
creatives enters the released game genre with a positive review by me while some still are bemoaning the pro upgrade they have to remember that about eighty of the craft able content is free to play with this game many of their reviews show evidence that they lack an understanding on how the crafting system recipes and blueprints work it takes more than an hour or two of game play to understand these things fully with that said i want to talk about the blueprints that are also available many totally misunderstand this part of the game and see the coin price tag but miss how to get nearly all the blueprints for free the price tag is only if you want all the blocks now what this means is if you craft the corner stone for the blueprint and place it where you want the structure the blueprint will walk you through building it all you have to do is collect the resources make the blocks then place them where the blueprint tells you to place it free while there are still a few bugs in the blueprint system such as blocks being required to face in wrong directions the deus are aware of this and are working to correct this on a blueprint by blueprint update hopefully it gets finished soon though they are more focusing on game bugs in the code than a misdirected block in a free blueprint understandably at the heart of this game unlike the similar min craft game creatives takes place on an online server so internet is required to play this game in the free version you are limited in the features and number of personal worlds you create this is understandable due to server space equates to money the pro upgrade gives you more control and additional worlds you can create that being said if you want your world to be private and for you only you can set it as such and even password it so only you can enter it once the password has been entered once it doesn't need to be entered again from my experience you can make it just as easy a private server world where only you and your friends have access or a public one that any can join a newer feature in creatives that i have yet to explore so will be very brief on is the ability to build and share adventures along with having rewards for those who visit and review it while having not made any yet to share this feature does show promise and eventually i will jump into this part and update my review when i have in building your world you can claim land to keep others friends or foes from altering the area you are building in this includes blowing things up with explosives pro players have extra free claims per world and more flexibility to the rules they sit compared to the free to play players one of a few nice incentives to purchase the pro downloadable content the building part of the world seems a little clumsy and confusing at first but once you learn how the crafting system works it becomes really easy and fast just keep at it keep unlocking block recipes by building blocks and you will get the hang of it it will take more than an hour or two for you to get the hang of things on your first time playing also expect to die from silly things until you gain an understanding on the mechanics if you have played min craft this part is a little more confusing where as all recipes are known you just figure them out in creatives you must learn how to construct from the recipes and unlock the locked ones by building other recipes that come before such as what is needed for an iron door is unknown until you first build the wooden door this is where many who have negative reviews are getting confused with what is free and pro remember just because it is locked doesn't mean it int free it simply means it must be learned some recipes the only way to learn them is to find them in a chest or a drop less than twenty of the available recipes must be purchased with coins and those are mostly cosmetic also do note that some recipes are only available during specific events such as halloween and christmas additionally there are a few limited time recipes from the store grab those free ones while you can next the graphic detail of the game is great in my opinion it reminds me of min craft but with a mod to give the game the he textures the game play is reminiscent of min craft for those of use who played it but i feel it is a touch easier to play i do miss the mods but i suspect in time mods will become available and possibly incur aged however i do not foresee this as something soon due to how this game works at the core some also bemoan the pro upgrade when it came out due to those features were in the early access free while under testing were moved into the pro feature after doing some hunting in the forums it was pointed out that these were being added free so they had a large player base to find bugs and correct them before pro was released remember people it was early access and available so they could test the feature before they made people pay money for them and really the game is fully playable without the glider fun and somewhat useful and you simply need to manage your inventory without the added a space in your backpack you can also get by without buying additional land plots and the free to play worlds are just as usable as the pro worlds the lack of pro features are not game breaking considering the game is mostly entered around teamwork and not competition competing with each other was the last thing on the deus mind when pro was released and it really gives marginal advantage if people are competing with all that being said the game gets a huge thumb up from me and i look forward to the new content as it comes out
alright guys i have about five hundred and seventy hours in this game so i guess its time for a review so as you all see it says its a free to play it actually is though but heres the catch that free word can be quite tricky you see when you start playing the game you get all pumped like of boy in gonna kill everything well your wrong because you re basically gonna be playing a demo you get a few animals to shoot as long with two animals you can hunt that rotate through out every week you cant create your own multiplayer server but you can join others the game will always make you feel like you have to buy more and more and sometimes you give in but if you done want to spend money that fine but before you go all of i hate this game free to play my quot why done you just give it a shot and spend at least a few hours twenty three trying to find a male whitetail or something it also helps to have a friend there with you that knows this game better this game almost sucks without a friend when you first start playing there a hunting forums for this game and this community loves to help out new players my point is this game int that bad if you just give it a shot
team fortress two is a wonderful gem on steam this amazing first person shooter is a wonderful relief from the seriousness of other first person shooter and games with a well balanced array of nine classes to choose from there is something for everyone in this title
early access review just not really a big fan on this but if you like a massively multiplayer online style and your a battle royal type of person here is a game for you stand point of games this is your game right here
this game this in game is so in good i have over five thousands or what gems nothing paid the animations in this game are just so bad ass when i summon a blue eyes i feel like the most bad ass person ever i feel like in in this in show its so good can taunt the enemies i can do everything i love the decks the cards everything also i only play set kaaba lolita just good the battles are fun at any moment it can change take one fun battle from me draws me animal ark headset me animal ark fiend in defence this dude polymerization first turn gets a nineteen hundreds monster attacks my cardio has twenty one hundreds defies ability activates and i special summoning blue eyes to eviscerate him to one thousands the uses time wizard move and in guesses right and all my monsters die set birthright he normal summons or some i cant remember a time wizard again and birthright activates for some reason and i summon back blue eyes from my graveyard he uses time wizard again but fails all his monsters die and he takes damage from the
best first person shooter on personal computer if you are looking for teamwork squad based battles on an epic scale this is it i would say you done need to spend money on this free to play and its definitely not pay to win however if you want to unlock cosmetics for your vehicles you can spend money doing so i have also spent money on unlocking weapons but you done need to do it as the difference in weapons is not that noticeable in game i love the diversity of combat in this game and the vehicles are cool i recommend joining one faction only at a time live gone to for life baby
to all the haters this game is awesome i really like hack and slash role playing game manga type games its also side scrolling too who cares if you need to buy costumes in game you can get them in drops from quests recommend this game would play as raven again
product received for free early access review very fun very good things that good id lots of food that satisfies me because in fat good graphic very fun wonky physics thing bad too many weapon too many ammo typeunoptimizedhard to master overall eight hundred and ten got also nerf browning five auto plus thanks
early access review pretty awesome free to play shooter if you like really close quarter engages and mostly hip firing but the overall the maps are too small and the spawn points are a problem to make it fun for a longer period for me free to play and the progression system is pretty fast compared to most other free to play games good servers no lag at all great graphics that my decent laptop can handle with no problem you get a great primary gun and sidearm from the start and additional guns are pretty easy to obtain all guns feel viable most of the maps feel way too small only having two or three corridors spawn points are too close to each other two steps and you re already in the enemy spawn sentry turrets are to play against and its not instantly visible if its friendly or not most classes feel kinda meh destroy is a game mode where you need to defend your containers but half of them are closer to the enemy spawn than your own
early access review personally i love playing this game with my friends however in the interest of progression i have a few suggestions for development of the game now in not an expert or anything but just consider this the thoughts of a seasoned gamer first off i would like too see more work put in to customizing all the characters move sets making each one feel more unique secondly the overall movement feels a bit off not bad per be just off a brawler needs to be a bit more fast paced than this one is the gravity could stand to be a bit more forceful and a slight increase in character speed couldn't hurt either and finally the maps now i know this is still early access but a little more variation would be nice as a suggestion what about opening map development to steam users and a ranking system to make the better built maps show up more frequently all in all this is a good start but needs some more love before it will have the kind of replay value that smash bros does i like this game and hope the developers read this review
early access review the game wont launch stuck at loading seventy six for fifteen minutes like the lady said int nobody got time for that google it if you done understand the reference lao
неплохой the killer of подобии clash of clans огромный of the the a the a of the очередность the a выстроена of the a the of the a of the the a of the of a pvt the of the of определенных соперников сливаешь of the a the обстреляли a отмутузили a of the a one the делаешь a the впринцыпе неплохо of ten the the six
early access review apologize for the poor grammar just refunded and let me tell you why note i read the apology letter from the exec producer was touched but not convinced artificial economy why are you capping min and max price ranges on items in the a i feel like this is a law jazzy way of trying to stop bothers and cheaters like come on now web browser a why is the auction house a damn browser three no end game content self explanatory although the executive producer did mention something in his apology letter about all the real stuff will come in weeks well maybe you shouldn't have launched yet getting pushed back is better than this fiasco right now feeling like a mobile massively multiplayer online game so i played crusaders of light and it feel bless online gave me the that exact feeling except with better twenty twelves personal computer graphics auto run to quests that auto run to you an area then you are given a vague mistranslated detail on how to complete your quest five pay to win right now there is some pay for convenience aspect of the game going on such as using re money to buy gems that give you teleportation to certain dungeons it center nothing major but this just opens the door for more pay to win stuff delay in combat to be honest i really like the combat it was fun trying to combo these spells together into creative spell chains but it was so clunky and felt delaunay embedded whenever i would hit my stance conversion and try to cast a follow up spell often the game was running so poorly that i would miss the follow up spell i would constantly spam and check for a confirmation but nope i would just miss the spell completely basically what in saying is the combat is not very smooth seven translation what can i say anything in the english language that has a is censored you can say the most vulgar things but you cannot say words like again bag lag you cannot even type be wiz out because it is censored some of the spell translations are off too so sometimes you just have to guess at what you are doing not so rewarding grinding anything that int combat related is boring as hello this one is a positive i like the voice acting this is more like some advice lets come back in a month and see what happens maybe it changes like the exec producer said it would
i nominated this game for the just five more minutes award you have an early day tomorrow you need to get some sleep so you re just going finish one more match before you decide to tuck in for the night just one more wait one more what a that you say its two thirty am yep most of you can relate overall its a solid mob game like one of the reviewer said its not pay to win the in game purchases are for cosmetic purpose only the cons is that this is mob game means you play with people and people can be annoying sometimes well maybe a lot but the game provided options to play with artificial intelligence so you can still play alone my score nine hundred and ten for the game for the community
first off let me just say that this game is simply amazing and extremely realistic you can not get this sort of fun and realism within a simulator besides this one the only down side is that you have to be individual aircraft that vary in prices but the ones that are over thirty are not worth spending your money on i recommend getting the ones that are cheaper in price not in quality overall i give this game a nine hundred and ten
rollercoaster of emotions spent much kong hong dollar and cried inside made me realise i have a problem with money my wife left me because i spent all our money on dice rolls you karen
a test game ever try joining a server disconnected second attempt disconnected third attempt disconnected fourth attempt waiting the game to loads forever disconnected again would get cancer
that feeling when you are too lazy to download hearthstone and you re also addicted to the elder scrolls with this game you can play hearthstone and feel the elder scrolls universe still cool and would recommend when the elder scrolls is life
early access review voted game of the year amazing game how is this free start pushing skins and camps and you will be rich from snowboarding zip lining hang gliding to getting a kill so much fun love the entire user interface and menu system all works great together first and third person view is smooth only negative is maybe speed up the time all in all great game thank you
early access review got the game like a year ago when if you downloaded it on free to play weekend you got to keep the game looks like a slideshow weird considering my two thousand and fours toshiba laptop should be able to run it
early access review like the title says this game is full of jump scares adorable jump scares from adorable little two dimensional monsters you progress from adorable room to adorable room slowly finding each adorable little jump scare along the way then the adorable jump scares start following you then the adorable rooms start getting harder to navigate then the adorable rooms start changing this game is adorable this game is brilliant but above all this game is terrifying
i have thousands of hours in client as steam els word crashes on me and i have nothing but good to say pros free did i mention free simple combat that can lead into various complex or generally interesting combo vast character and skill difference no bad or best characters its all about preferences and skill level cons sometimes when you full screen or anything like that in steam the game crashes to desktop
early access review a two dimensional platform fighter where the best of the baddest warriors in history battle each other in an eternal tourney of champions for bragging rights infinite mead and the pure pleasure of delivering a beat own includes online four player free for all custom games and local play options a version of smash bros with an original lore and a lot of characters to chose definitely a good option to play with friends or alone
somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me i int the sharpest tool in the she she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumbing the shape of an a on her forehead well the years start coming and they done stop coming fed to the rules and i hit the ground running int make sense not to live for fun your brain gets smart but your head gets dumbo much to do so much to see so whats wrong with taking the back streets you'll never know if you done go you'll never shine if you done glow
great game bad community community there is awful just poor parenting sex craved kids who cant do anything but hack or bad mouth about anything they hack in this game so dam much and log int doing anything about it even if you've reported them i know this cause in reported a lot before and only the pay to win players are never banned also this is the only game i can think of who trash talks about black people a lot
do you like dungeons and dragons do you like playing online with friends and random strangers are you okay with your friends not actually playing and getting stuck with random strangers for mandatory party missions if you said yes to all of the above then this is the game for you this game being part of the do franchise stays true to the universe and respectful to the source material
data two is a multiplayer game though you can play against bots there are two teams of five players the radiant and the dire each player picks from a list of many characters each with a different set of abilities the two teams start on opposing sides of the map there only one map in the game each team has a base area in which resides an ancient from each base creeps these autonomous pc creatures spawn periodically in waves and start a journey towards the other teams base towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit the goal for each team is to destroy the other teams ancient while defending their own hence defense of the ancients sounds simple but there a lot more to it than this imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other meeting somewhere in the middle of the map where they will fight again they do this automatically without any player input the creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out the next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over or they'll reach a tower and get smashed by it and the cycle will continue basically nothing will happen the game will not end because the creeps cant get anywhere now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps he can attack the enemy creeps and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map knocking down towers along the way eventually hell get to the enemy ancient and be able to destroy it but if just one enemy player comes out to meet him the teams will be more evenly matched and it comes down to a player versus player player versus player scenario the player versus player is of course the heart of the game it is of a high level of complexity the learning curve is quite steep making it challenging for boobs which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what i will euphemistically call short tempered people one player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team the complexity comes from two main parts first the sheer number of selectable characters in the game at the time of writing there are one hundred and two characters with more added periodically as the game is updated each character has four different abilities sometimes more that are active requiring the user to press something to make them go or passive they just operate automatically the abilities are character specific though there are common elements between them some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively and each ability is levelled individually as your character earns experience after you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them consider that in addition to that there are over one hundred and twenty different items that you can equip your character with items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones again they are active or passive in nature of yeah each game takes a long time to finish around fort five minutes is pretty common you will never get away with saying ill just have a quick game of data to your significant other at least not once they've put up with you playing it a few times so learning curve big one time investment or sink if you prefer big one especially when you re trying to play with other people and they re abusing you for not knowing what you re doing but the real question is is it worth it live clocked up almost four hundred games and there still some characters i haven played in not turning pro any time soon but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals my win rate is about fifty which seems to be fairly normal losing is often traumatic especially after you've lost a couple of long four thousand five hundred and sixty minute games in a row or you re saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots or just bad but the games that are good they re really good with so many combinations and different ways to exploit them the level of satisfaction when you re playing with friends and manage to coordinate a five person push on a tower laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities wiping out the other team well that what keeps me coming back for more not only that but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps its genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations there are always new builds to try and new items to buy live gone through several favourite characters depending on which new ones live played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates even after around four hundred hours of game time i still have more to explore i do however only really enjoy playing the game with my friends live tried a few games solo just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service and i find this massively less fun its less engaging because i typically done like to communicate with randoms via voice and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased live had good games with randoms but generally done bother playing unless my mates are online as with all reviews this one attempts to help answer the question should i buy this game well good news data two is free it has just come out of a long invite only beta period so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero but there are two big questions you need to ask yourself one can i justify the amount of time i need to get decent at this game before i start enjoying it make no mistake the learning process for this game is an ordeal if you re prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty maybe ten games then that a good start if you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that good but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing a lot while you re still struggling with the basics the best way to approach it is to read some guides i recommend welcome to data you suck and play with bots until you can beat them on hard reliably with one character then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noon status and play some games online with them the more friends the better if you re matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant why is it free i seriously can play this without paying anything data two is built on the premium model its free to play and you can purchase in game items for money by giving the game away valve hope to make more money selling in game items than if they charged for the game this is an increasing trend so get used to seeing it more especially for games with a strong network effect i a anything with multiplayer the things you can buy for data two are basically adornments for the characters for example you can outfit them with new armour or a new sword or some new spell effects that are different from the stock standard one that they come with you can get some of these for free they'll randomly drop at the end of games but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for its very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the game play at all you cant pay money for a new sword that does more damage it just looks different this is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay town thing if you re a content creator you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store splitting revenue with valve
early access review was of with most of the updates over the past year however the no drivers seat no tiered arm or cubes has made the game to simplistic for me people complaining about good players building and designing machines that were superior frustrated me a good game will have many different facets and layers to it free am has removed those facets making the game uninteresting but hey now the most basic of intelligence and thought will do well in this game
done waste your life on this its addicting but the deus only concern is making money they done care what you think and they will push you to buy the bigger better tanks and planes through sheer frustration alone done waste your time getting addicted to it its really not worth your time and money in jumping ship because i cant take it any more
feels clunky looks clunky has huge depth for hardcore min max players but offers nothing for me that i cant get out of the other games in the genre cant argue on the price so go test it out yourself and see if its your cup of tea
what can i say i always loved yugo anime and played games on playstation two and personal computer the game itself is not bad visual effects could be better but it doesn't matter the worst thing about this game is matchmaking and the duel time is shortened you literary attack with one monster two times and you win lose that it you done even have time to activate two spell straps in the same game
early access review this is pretty much a free game with a mixture of counter strike global offensive and cod but for a free game i would highly recommend it the only thing i would want them to implement is australia oceania servers but other than that great game
early access review this is a very early access game the developers of this game cares about it they will change the game according to the community demands but as of right now i done recommend playing the game for enjoyment will change my rating when i see some major feature improvements
early access review well first of all this game is a giant blend between inhales counter strike go battlefield cod and ass exhales the best thing about this game that it has the elements of the above stated games but hey its completely free the only drawback that this game is kinda pay town you either gotta grind a ton or spend a ton trash community tho
controls are good looks good not that expensive but damn the small portion of players who are just playing bumper cars make it unplayable there is no way to kick them so done recommend play los or something
early access review enter gamete is this main men enter match of this is pretty good graphics get killed by random guy with full arm or play one more game find bunkers with machine guns find car exit better aug eye such a great game with allot of potential
hate the update is worse than the previous version the bot is in stupid they keep taking the courier all over the world and in fed up with this game now probably not gonna play this game anymore and please do not forget to nerf the in ape king
early access review here was once a time when everyone lived in it then epic loot attacked edit i really did give this update a try but i really cant get over the new currency and the crates it feels like free am is going for a cash grab and i feel like i can no longer make any cash while playing the game really all they need to do is remove the crates or make currency gain able through matches but until then i can no longer support this game now here is sum lenny a you thought there was more
this is a free to play public game my friends want me to play and i played this game for five years as a married and working man listen me guys i played mainly support or roamer and what i see is fifteen funny games in or lose rest is get flamed after lose or see commend me guys type of guys if your team wins what i say is this is a great game absolutely good game but you know lots of the players wants to be satisfied else then game play and fun i decided not to pick support and see what happens and it was all chaos and flame maybe on my mar in not high mar player in not pro but everyone is here is miracle or ritz yes sometimes people say it my bad and sorry if you done have nothing else to do then uninstall this game and you will find a thing to do this is just waste of time if you done make money of this game just play it and count how many times it makes you happy or upset i know ill miss this game because its the best five versus five game in the world for me but somehow you find yourself in mar race and aim to go high do your best and win but somehow not fun you play it for the win win i and win or flame or flamed even if you say someone really nicely hey come lets go there do this you are getting flamed eighty five percent on my mar so this is a very very good game but we are not that good as humans it seems i even saw my lifetime friends flaming and arguing each other for this game so this is not for me have fun in mar race if you play this game just think about why people put money in it and try to increase players number its all about player community and money they make why you release a free to play game
early access review this is one of the best first person shooter i have played in a long time with time i have no part of my mind that says this can not be better than any call of duty made with this said even though it being in early access and free to play this is on my list of the best games i have ever played with most dislikes of the game come from grinding and name spam the grinding part is not as bad as everyone says it is i believe this is from people putting enough time to enjoy the game i see the people that complain about grinding have two thousand and thirty hours most of the time although i can agree the name spam is a problem but you need to see past all of this to enjoy any game with installing this game most wonder if it is even worth the space it takes and with it being early access makes people skip over the game when they see it with almost playing three hundred at the moment and most of it being a free to play i can say this game is not pay two win i believe people done realize most of the people paying money in game are the ones that have hours on hours on playing this game and they done have a more powerful weapon than you they just have skill the come with experience i strongly believe this is a game with great community while this review is all over the place i know i wrote it i recommend this game to anyone that is willing to give it the try it needs over the months i have shown people the ropes of the game and if you see this review and want to learn how to play just add me the una in my in game name if in online done even think twice about it ask me what ever you want to ask i want this amazing community to grow and help the average new person as well with all that said in allowing comments if anyone to ask questions there or even give their criticism on how bad this review is
early access review its of i guess if you looking for a casual massively multiplayer online its heavy instanced though since its a mobile port done right and the quest story its a bit general for an role playing game
the only game in the universe with more nonsense unstoppable tutorials than quake champions requires that you sign up to roughly ten different third party clients installs an endless array of middle are runs poorly and half the screens covered in popups and trash that you cant close move or reposition installing this was a mistake
early access review barely able to level up if you done follow the exact path you re supposed to its fun but its very limited if you done follow it by the actual story story is kind of lame and keeps you from grinding
this game is pretty much your average free play gong show you finds on the internet not just on steam and after learning about trio telemetry bin being in the new files before installing i can safely say that the developers behind trove and the lazy at trio themselves can go themselves to all corner of their infinitely boring content limited pay town as corporatism game world anything i could possibly and moan about has already been covered so i wont bother but do not download this in game i do not support illegal activities such as spyware you have been warned trio and you trio fast i in dare your stupid to do something about me fucking dare you you do not claim that a legitimate piece of spyware is a false positive when it is anything but i done know about anyone else here but live frigging had enough of a a developers making bottom theatre trash the only good game of any kind to come out in recent years have been the doom reboot tales of hysteria and and that pretty much it so trio if you are going to treat new players like well you too since you done need a new player we can easily head elsewhere perhaps to a free play title where players are actually i done know respected cough grey havens cough
early access review its good if you have friends to play with me personal i played with only one friend it has seemed like its improved ten fold since closed beta monsters are getting close to adventure quest worlds level but i have two little things that bug me though first off some of the near max level crafting can take six hours to complete but it continue the countdown while not in the game now second i felt like i got to near max level a little to fast i cant wait to see what the game will be like in two years
the update seven hundred why valve why we loved data because it want laugh out loud now it is like laugh out loud graphic is now horrible and cartoonish map is complete trash poor roman moved had looks unbelievably lame and loll ike lots of the game customisations like the character panel in game is now use less well pity for players who bough them the shop in game is now stupid you can to just see all items or write a few letters to find one you want now it shows only recommended if you want other you need to click to little wheel to see it horrible the fountains is that a joke okay don to mind them for example somewhere around the second towers maybe but if they are right next to the middle it will just destroy the whole game play why the hell always so pretty and complex data looks like as some mobile mob like mobile legends eve the design and graphic data is now like a fucking android and is game yuck also the new hero whf is that it is definitely like a laugh out loud hero has six skills all very powerful its kinda like he has six ultimate of other heroes and i don to even mention the fact that his base stats are pretty good too the new map layout suits him perfectly so he can do whatever he wants and kill everyone with ease now with trees everywhere and the distance he can do it there is no place on the map far enough for him to not be able to jump on a tree pros special stats increasing at certain levels upgrading of skills is easier now just one click cons new he new her new map layout new graphics new neutral on a lame position daylight clock design new hero picking stuff is it data or mortal combat update valve valve valve i don to know what kind of weed you had but guys throw it away its spoiled
eng its a good game i have rarely had so much fun on an old game this game reminds me of my childhood and i do not know how much time i spent on it but i played on game boy and i went to school playing this game and playing it on steam is a pleasure of madness personally i advise you this game is happiness pure and simple good games for best in bon sex be me suit basement mutant amuse sur in view juice sex me appellee mon enhance it be said pas combine de temps be pass nessus mail be louis sur game boy it dallas a coleen count ice sex it lay jour sur steam best in plainer de folie person element jevons be corneille be sex est do bonheur pure simple bon sex one thousand and ten to by ii big on nadine ski big hyundai wok plenty order by on bank local human harlan for gene kadar daman arcade home film forum am a game boyd on forum be buoyant myna ken okla git tim be bihar myna ken delilah hokum gift hansen size buoyant mut lulu save basic old june tayside editor mini ocular cd the she yoga hon hoo de you a we hon shoo you home due de jim you a de liq huge you a ring we i angle we de tannin we by hydro we huge due chang she in dish we i game boy shang win we of of mexico win huge you a win change a she of gluing de kuril we gran jinny no huge you a she xingu de chance he find no de you a up sore a you made us natasha a methane suzuki yoke game de tan ship sun yamashita kong game a natasha no kosovo idaho ovoid asa be natasha a sore of study asia jinan a wakarimasendeshitaga natasha a grub i de son anode natasha a kong game of pure gawk nikki ski de sonde ira no a khaki no york bides koine i in a kong game a jun guide shin purina of futures you game ten russ to who oshawa igraine redo period los take mongo vesalius a a starry gre eta ira nap minaret one of modem sets the i lane nay solo bremen a pot ratio a to no a girl a game boy i a pos hel a shikoku gray vet girl i great a new to tools time be mia techno a soviet you am chat by eta ira by a chis toy i pros toy hiroshige very one thousand and ten
i hate mobs i tried laugh out loud data and several other lesser known games i picked this up earlier this month and immediately became addicted my friends who hate mobs as much as i do also became addicted we now have our own small clan and play this game daily not sure what it is about the change of perspective from isometric click move to third person was controls that makes such a difference to me but now i can say i genuinely enjoy a mob the community int quite as toxic either so that a plus
early access review a fun and engaging game with lots of possibilities even though it is still in early access and is set to be free to play once it launches i have not regretted spending money on it as i have had my moneys worth of entertainment build explore farm and have fun even though i do not like comparing it to min craft there really is no way to avoid it if you enjoyed min craft you should check out creatives it is min craft with a lot more atmosphere and style and even though the is similar it just feels like creatives has an extra punch to it
early access review tag above this is a lie game used to a good between twenty fourteen two thousand and fifteen later updates basically fucking it in so many ways for one that wonders why of does this guy have a on record well i used to play when i had git god time back in the actual early access fri they keep that tag only to lure in new players so they can make more money on their update of by have you heard of a game called nether yes nether live already uninstalled it id say rob craft has become just like it no whf is nether well let me tell you its a game where the developers didst listen to the fantasy community when the game had great potential for future updates guess what deus got ready fans got mad deus abandoned the game fans abandoned the game some fans stuck around and prayed they would receive a blessing from god deus came back released a new patch with a new game mode remaining fans realized it want a blessing gave it a shot anyways regretted everything when satan appeared on the screen and took your soul so he could fuel the games cannibalistic hunger conclusion done waste your time here unless they revert to a earlier patch lets say when they first introduced megabits the only reason to why this game is rated mostly positive is because it used to be good really good back in the days of actual early access
early access review great game with a good veteran player community that wants to help new players learn the game while the game has some issues it is still under development and the deus are pretty good at fixing major issues they are also committed to bring regular updates to the game that adds features and are quick to modify the new features based on player feedback if needed all in all nine hundred hours of fun and counting
good combat straight forward game play move right to proceed makes it easy to find fights and keep up with enemies around your level most of the paid items are cosmetic aside from character slots and unfortunately action bar upgrades but its not entirely pay town
early access review decent battle royal better than pub in my opinion needs some changes one being you need to be able to shoot while vaulting over something not just be a bullet sponge this is only getting a thumbs up because you can snowboard and do flips
i love this game played the free game which was more than satisfying good for kids and adults updates bring new skills and blocks and bug fixes the new blueprint builds are excellent so many talented people out there that put my rubbish build attempts in the shade so thanks to you clever peeps a my son bought the pro version for me my birthday this last august thanks son three hundred and thirty three i love it even more with the extra perks pro brings so give it a try its fun go lose yourselves for a little in your own world full of unexplored adventure thanks playful for creatives auGust
it is really great to have this game on my computer everything is very smooth and pretty duel links itself is great and it really is a blessing i can have it on my computer now without using an android emulator
early access review great great game except there is network problem sometimes much more balanced than hearthstone strongly recommended if you like card game that require no luck but mind power while it can be rated ninety thousand one hundred if its without those network issues
off its true this game has premium planes ships and tanks now that we have that out of the way i assure you premium vehicles means absolutely nothing with when talking about in game effectiveness i will now only talk about tanks as its what i mainly play this game for as far as mechanics go its simple aim and shoot short barrels have to compensate and long ones done if you get hit and the projectile damages your crew badly you might have to stand still for a bit as you have to swap whoever is still alive even if you are standing in the middle of nowhere same if you get your tracks tires or engine hit if your cannon is hit you might not be able to shoot until you repair it any free tank can devastate a premium one with ease hell a fast reserve tank can kill high level tanks before they can realise what is happening tanks are mostly very agile too even antitank i sometimes take my studs into a game to drift for a while and flank enemies they shouldn't be played like that it also feels really satisfying to one shot an enemy that just realised was in danger and was about to run off i also have to say two more things first one is these kind of games are for a very specific consumer not made for everyone i thought it want made for me either until i tried it out second one is that the first tanks you will encounter will be a bother to try and drive shoot but it will get much better a few vehicles in
this game looks nice and feels nice just like the race seven but with better graphics the tracks and cars in this game are extremely expensive almost five euros for some tracks and three cars for ten euros unless they lower the prices this game doesn't appel to me too much there are five free cars and two tracks pretty lame and the tracks at least are extremely boring not real tracks and again if you want hockey hearing or mona you have to pay real money overall nine hundred and ten great pamela simulation but the content that makes this game exciting is very expensive
this game is really great bots perform extremely realistic almost eliminating the point in playing is real humans bots will ignore you when you ping a hero just like humans bots will steal your farm just like humans bots will a the enemy just like humans bots will ignore enemies taking roman just like humans bots will not ward just like humans supposedly this has been fixed
this game is awesome for gun nuts countless hours i have some complaints though it can be a bit jacky to navigate the game but you get used to it also getting a new gun to play with is super overpriced and the pay to win int worth it so you cant even really pay to advance either and not because its not an option but because its too expensive i get the point is to really get all the achievements for each gun and truly learn it but for some guns you are getting every achievement and not even getting a return back so you have to go and redo it a hundred times after the achievements to get experience points and advance regardless i think it is a great game with countless of hours to it plenty of challenge and variety if this continues to add more and more weapons that would be great
so this game is so garbage yugo is fun but for some reason duel links is buggy as crap if i play a trap card it bugs out if i win a game and after i get my rewards in stuck on a a screen and can only alt of to get out of it i went to duel a friend to see if that at least would work but it also bugged out after he ended his turn and on my end it showed he did not so we got stuck doing nothing and again only way out was alt of
yesterday i played about four games in the new data and guess what i do not feel this data i do not feel this caber sport thank ice frog you destroyed all that was dear to me now is not data this is laugh out loud ice frog trying to increase diversity but it turned out that he made the game even easier but data has always been famous for its complexity live deleted it and perhaps game come to its senses and return us to the good old data not this a a a a a
i rate planet side two very well even though there like a very steep learning curve its a well detailed game with three warring factions against one another to statically take over four contents by using six different classes and nine different and unique vehicles there are many weapons class perks equipment vehicle perks and many items to unlock by killing enemies and taking over territories and most importantly the game is free for all a unless if you want to be a member by paying some money per month
this game is the greatest to ever seen i played without steam for a so i have experience the history about is new freda is is owner of new and he was the one who destroyed the is game with his gratis cheats on me after destroying is he bought the is license laugh out loud question for the community would you sell the game to the guy that destroyed your game so serge tito creator of is did it i assume freda is and serge tito worked together all the time or something is very wrong with serge negative pay to win one hundred inaccurate aim everyone can see you when you spawn you are still loading the game but other players can see you at the map fanti cheat engine for kids game freeze server crashing all the fun time its funny when you play battle royal a and you are the third last guy character movement ray strange if you play the game alone you will never win because other player are in a group spawn places ray strange because the map is big but you will spawn next to each other holders have no idea of programming maybe they can write hello world in ten different languages but nothing else positive at the moment nothing conclusion never buy anything that was made by freda is or serge timothy powerpoint interactive publisher arts entertainment because this guys work like a mafia
only skill is needed unlike the rest of the free to play mob games you can find on the net cant really go wrong with that other games force you to pay for heroes even the community is total cancer though but one could say the same for every other online game in existence just watch your wallet the shines in this will eat through it faster than a hungry hamster in a pile of sunflower seeds
early access review if your tired of playing call of duty or battlefield and wanna get that old battlefield nineteen fort threes feel well this is it this game is a wonderful world war two game that will not stop developing well of course till every major faction is added but this game focuses on everyone cooperating into finishing the job of capturing territory including different roles in order to support one another also there will be times when you are pretty much out gunned like this for example germans have air support tigers while allies would have inflight tank recon but that makes the game challenging and forces you to storm on a plan and work together with people as a team
early access review so i bought the american sniper recently i bought it only for the scope id checked out for a while i have never purchased anything in a free to play game before this is the only time i have ever spent money on something like this and of coarse i get screwed over in the most recent update they decided to take that scope away from me you now have to buy the recon class to be able to use the scope which live already owned by giving them real money you could an buy that very same rifle for a much more reasonable price grind i am now stuck with a rifle that costed me a lot more than it would have if id purchased it today scoreless this so called recon class costs twenty i am not buying something live already owned i am very disappointed with how the developers screwed me over like this they sell something to you takes it away repackage it in a different form then sells it again for a much higher price the greed is strong with this one but for a game that is free it is worth playing its a lot of fun just be careful how much money you spend in these sorts of games
i use to really enjoy this game seriously it was absolutely amazing that is until the squad update came in and ruined everything basically everything in the game is unbalanced this game is a pay to win i had high hopes for this game to be an amazing world war two first person shooter
a fairly decent time waster at this point its literally just a clicker game to me as i spend a few minutes clicking on everyone stats in up dec i al rooms to raise them and move the maxed stats dwellers around give it a few more days and all one hundred and ninety three dwellers will have one hundred special stats if you like fallout or feel reminiscent and want to waste away a bit of time this is the game for you
lets be clear the full game costs five hundred and this number will climb rapidly over time do not buy in in or you will just continue to encourage the pay to buy cards business model that compromises balance and player enjoyment to squeeze as much cash from players as they can tolerate believe it or not it would be possible to make a strategic card game that respects the player and prioritizes game balance and player enjoyment too bad it will never happen because players keep giving in and funding this abusive business model the usual trickle of daily quests disrespects the player by urging them to form a habit of logging in to get a pittance of gold balance int as bad as some other card games but it wont be long before you'll get hopelessly stomped by players using decks you could never make without dropping a significant chunk of cash
wrote a review at the point where the game is starting to slow down this game want a waiting simulator it was a lot of clicking managing stuff to try and be as efficient as possible now however i see times becoming longer and prices becoming higher just a warning had fun until now though
early access review update ever churchill inglorious guns get ton of bug asur a tank hit tree and explosion panther a dead with one hit panzer and or tank if get hit totally no damage sound from one hundred zero life in one hit on hellcat or a i play over hour and a update like this goodbye hong delete it from my library and last one inside ton of span kill with mines or tank span location in good well beta excuse
pro good if a into old school yugo play style no byz pendulum synchro and other stuff yet cons lazy porting this whole software still designed for mobile there is even no max windows button literally you could call this emulator not a personal computer version harder than dark souls because i got auto lose for almost every ranked or pc duels because some of connection problem while i have decent and stable connection and in terms of games a only got three fields for monster spell trap cards instead of five do seems useless for me why you bother duelling artificial intelligence who cant fight back stage quest would be good too if we didst have to duel many pointless battle even with auto duelling prefer to duel twenty three games against good artificial intelligence than many games with auto duelling like that well cant complaint more since its free to play and i done really mind about micro selling in free games would recommend if at least technical problem got solved and have personal computer friendly user interfaces
early access review normally i done write reviews but this game deserved one from me even tho it is in alpha the in depth system of it is absolutely amazing live never played a alpha game that was so smooth so fun and addicting its kind of like a space mob but extremely balanced all you need to know is your ship classes what they all are good against and a good tactic i mean come one who docent want to get into a intense dogfight just to find out your the last one left with three enemies surrounding you waiting to jump you but lets face it you get so into it when you hit your thruster out of there sight behind a asteroid with no hull left but some tin foil and some rockets speeding at your face while warping out then making the jump back home just to go back out and fight this game has so much potential not only do you choose your ship but some awesome bad ass crew you can hire and put on your ship with catchy phrases sold cant wait until the developers add more to this game its golden there so many ideas you can put into this game to keep it the great game it is i wish i could be on there development team myself that how great there doing with it but yes i do recommend it and this is a game i all always come on to play i want to get more people into it and hopefully see others to warp right on top of them and tackle them before they can even put there jump drive on and if the developers are happening to read this keep going its just amazing what you have created and always remember to keep it nice and balanced just how it is hopefully i will see you all in game and let your bodies float around the cold cosmos
super unique and fun game definitely worth a try i mean its free to play so you may as well and yes i do have more hours than whatever i have on steam i prefer launching the game itself instead of doing it through steam May
early access review great game has very good graphics loading time beats pub and plays smooth only thing that i done like to much is the viewing distance you have to get pretty close to see someone even with a sniper and you should be able to see them easily especially in snow please done just have one map like the rest of the battle royal games make another one or two and add more weapons
after some time playing it meh this game has a lot of problems gotta take a break from it a few weeks later pooh a new league week into the new league this is the best arg evert hats the gist of it if you like dial like games play it done get overwhelmed let it sink in but stick to it you will love it once you get bored take a break come back a month later and fall in love again would absolutely recommend
free to play pay to enjoyed read that somewhere on the hunters official forums and the summary resonated with me at some thirty hours played with that said its incredible two notes on this work one there are few games with better gunplay and two it is the best hunting game simulator available the hunter has it all unfortunately most of the content is gated want to hunt mallards well you re going to need to buy a set of decoys a blind and a nice shotgun in addition to the license win boar hunting tournaments that demands use of a hog feeder and the feed in addition to a tree stand for an optimal experience and that the key optimal you do not need anything other than the permitted gun ammo and license to hunt a particular animal however you'll have to work much harder to win competitions or have a successful hunt if none of this seems like it will dissuade you and you've some cash to make your experience easier its well worth the value for what you get
i rather like how this game goes people complaining about having to be glued to your screen not true just simply save and exit your game and you can come back in nineteen hours and it will only have depleted a little and you can gather all your stuff i really love this game
early access review own source and go and i still think this game is fun sure it might be a knock off but its sure fun to play for and giggles i mean the guns are stupid overpowered and the movement is pretty jan the point of games is to have fun and i think people would have more fun playing a glitchy game and laughing at the random stuff that happens in it rather than a less glitchy game with better game play overall its just too much fun to run around and knife people in the face or asp them from unfair spots
this game is so sloppy that the best word i can think of for it takes forever to start up and closes on connection error horrible has the profoundly stupid choose a faction and one of the mostlyfactionunique races that are also highly restricted in class choice system please remove this from all future mos forever after the clumsy and rushed tutorial any keys you rebound will revert and you will lose the skill line the tutorial had you equip without any indication that anything changed until you suddenly notice the frame rate is atrocious and takes massive drops in certain areas for no clear reason this affects your ability to type coherently the combat system is roundabout and intuitive to absolutely zero benefit other than just to be different half of your skill bar is constant no chaining and the other half is dynamic chaining you can equip two chaining skill lines and swap them each hotkey on the active chaining line is actually a combo starter that you continue with a its a cool idea but implemented atrociously all of the characters are shall we say impaired not only is the full voice acting very awkward and misses the proper intonation of basically every single sentence but the sentences themselves are written in a strange no conversational whimsical grammar stew that is confusing and baffling this has the effect of making the entire game story a confusing surreal fever dream the auto path does not account in any way for dynamic terrain so your character will happily walk off of moving platforms and ruin the auto path completely certain quests done tell you what you re supposed to do for instance i just took an airship as part of a quest with no indication of where to go on the airship i had to hunt on the map and compare the quests details to figure out the correct destination i then had to wait like five minutes for the airship to physically travel there in real time and with loading screens
they are in up the entire game and it seems they are going down a pay to win path paid modifications for tanks seriously used to be fun but now they done listen to the community
early access review the game is very enjoyable for the price of thirty you do not need to buy the forty or one hundred and fifty all the more expensive ones just give you are skins the game is not pay to play and will not be the developers are working hard on fixing all the bugs more so then other games

best strategic card game you can built your own card strategy also money or premium player doesn't effect to your fun gam gives a to chance to earn soul gems and golds also drop events in stream totally free to play fun and challenge but some cards so overpowered and some opponents play their turn so slowly on purpose and waiting you to quit
early access review initially this game was very fun but the epic loot update has effectively killed any interest that i may have had in it this game has devolved into people finding weird ways to mitigate damage through exploiting how some of the shapes work and destroyed any sense of creativity making art builds completely pointless and ineffective having to disenchant items and use that dust to create new parts was a dumb direction to take this game its an awful lot like how hearthstone lets you destroy craft new cards may
early access review why would you hate on this game pros amazing graphics suicidal thought broken screen from raging makes you find new interests like how to tie a hanging man noose but there are some bad things too garbage autistic csc your hacking gives you one hundred chance of diabetes like literally the only positive reviews on this games are meant to be taken as a joke
early access review okay so first of all this is a new game and a free game we have seen a lot of free games on steam and we know how bad they can be i know that the battle royal genre is getting a little bit out of hand right know but i can genuinely say that this game is fun especially when you play it with friends so try it what are you waiting for its definitely worth it
re was absolutely terrible not so long ago the interface was a nightmare and the racing odd with the huge coloured markers it center if you judge it on that let me tell you that its now a completely different game the interface now makes sense and is one of the best you'll find out there the game is free to play with purchases for content but the ability to enter certain events without purchasing the content and the option to try before you buy there are frequent sales so you done have to spend a fortune cars are very impressive with the physics being better than racing project cars and asset to cora but not quite as good as factor two tracks while not laser scanned are not too far off the quality of res nonuser scanned tracks the geometry is generally accurate but of course you done get the exact bumps but laser scans quickly become out of date so this int as big an issue as one might expect sounds are the best you'll find anywhere really expressing the clunky rattling shaking madness of a real race car net code needs a bit of work cars behave strangely with high pings and disconnects happen but multiplayer is in alpha i believe so hopefully that all improve in time the usual issues of only thirty finishing and loads of wrecks apply in public servers but plenty of leagues exist to cater to the more serious racer single player features the most enjoyable artificial intelligence live raced against in short re is vastly better than it was and now deserves a place among the elite of sim racing
early access review an interesting game but what kills it for me is the fact this game installed a tool called foreigner net on your personal computer which is not uninstalled when the game is uninstalled there no uninstaller for it so you have to research how to remove it further research a revealed its a torrent seeder which is identified by my a as malware re the response from the developer the game was uninstalled through steam which is how all games should be installed uninstalled if obtained through steam i would also argue that any updates should be deployed through steam and not a third party application if foreigner net is not a malicious software contact sop hos to let them know
pay to win business model like clash of clans where if you spend more money the faster you advance obtain a higher advantage compared to other players that done spend money on this game at the moment this game is dead this may also be caused by the extremely long queue times when the game just came out which has driven away many potential players but of course that was last time of how the mighty has fallen May
thank you for destroying the gamer i a heroes generals awesome game destroyed by chester and stupid deus that dose to this game very new update they something they never listen to players what they what just trow random that are unless and even more unbalance community is toxic as hell telling anything that is wrong with game a get your self a banned from it because moderators that watch post ban everything they done like they use their powers little too much they are an idiots i never seen so many guys banned from it was reading post very second guy that post that there is something wrong with game or suck get inst ban from it the guy that doing that is dead man nice job kiddo can find much better game then this everything a what or love in game prepare to get nerve this game not worth spending any cash or time with it i wish i could ask for refund or just sell acc and get out of this trust me guys i have a lot of hours and i promise a this game had good potential but when money sucking is and retard moderators get into this game its just when to hell and i am not insulting anyone just saying the truth that guys maybe will read and maybe start playing and they need to know how big this game is there is the truth about whole game edit worst support ever losing whole day at fixing their game because they are unless they wont respond to ticket hopefully they will after one week losing veteran and fixing the game by my self new update after one year and guess what one hundred and twelve update they up pard tank balance light tanks can kill tiger two and all planes are unbalance recon planes are dominating sky install and looking for new game from best to worst world war two game on steam in two updates nice job retro motor did good think its worst company i saw in years of playing any games and i think they should quit their job or sell a game to some maybe normal company or just giveaway for free they suck major a
awful unfair matchmaking asks optimised graphics all of duty two had better graphics than this game this game should stay on mobile matches last like ten second easy to upgrade your tank boring
early access review was bored on footnote and bugs in pub are really pain in the then i finally found this its really good battle royal and i think it can go big like footnote or pub there are little innovations like snowboard glider or climbing and deus are listening to community there are some bugs but nothing game breaking but i want raw input and be able to change resolution in full screen deus please add these things
early access reviewing been a fan of space flight games for some years now and this one is right at the top of the list great game and simple to jump into and start playing when new to the game and then dip into for a quick battle here and there or to say good by to an evening the emphasis is on teamwork and is critical to whether you win or are defeated what is nice is that whether playing with an basic ship or an all singing all dancing upgraded ship no one can simply destroy an opponent in one or two hits making the game playable across levels upgrades are simple to understand and easy to achieve if players are bold enough during game play to earn them and the bonus points on offer each time you play although it is in alpha development there is already a strong range of ships from the menacing us flag ship to the small total corvette each with a role that has no less of a function than others get it and love it
early access review in a long time player of as games and after knowing of what they do i can say yes they do have their blunders and their strokes of genius aqua three dimensional is unfinished and probably never will be since its updates will be similar to their other games where they never actually end right now the game is very unfinished but they are progressing towards a new unique game unlike many others id recommend this game to anyone who likes a game they can continue to come back to since there will always be something to actually come back to that is new
well its fun but it wont let me play anymore in the sand box mode you cant have weaponry witch can make it boring and it is almost impossible to turn weapons on and there are so little things to fly its basic flying a few times then you get bored because there should be a few free for things so yeah add more free items and people will play more
a clever little game for all the part time fallout fans out there this game is a time suck with very little pay off there is some strategy to the game but is ultimately the same there is very little replay value once you get past the initial unlocking which you can accomplish in a day if you try the only story here is the one that is in your head with all these negatives its still free and occasionally fun but still cant give it a thumbs up because they want you to spend money on random drops
early access review for a free game it is worth it maps are a little small and there not to many guns but that actually the best part of this game the simplicity my only complaint is the head shot hotbox is probably over fifty of the character model rating edit after the last couple of updates there is less people playing and even more hackers to the point it is now unplayable
good but not complete it focuses more on the old school players me cd and does not include the byz tuners it center this uses the speed format in not complaining about it i like it but i wish there are other available format options since this game was originally a mobile game the graphics suck for personal computer they should rework the graphics for personal computer this will have to satisfy my nostalgia for now until they create the complete yugo experience for personal computer
this game how can i describe it is an above average game do note i said above average not wonderful or perfect since it is riddled with problems first the community ever since the game has first been released publicly especially to steam the community has began to die down more and more people carrying their incompetence is spreading like a disease but even so there is still many people veterans who are still friendly and ready to help out our fellow gamers the forums of war thunder is a rather friendly place if you follow the rules or the moderators will start ban in second the game play the game play is very good but for the most hardened pilots int enough the flight models are just inaccurate damage models are tweaked against their historic counterpart and many many more but even so i believe the game play can compensate for this problem finally the economy huff with many other reviews and posts complaining about the grind of this game i must disagree with the the grind is really really damn long but it helps you too it makes you learn your aircraft become part of it and also the game doesn't owe you anything its a free to play it also int a pay town game as the premium aircraft are more so regular planes that either lend lease captured or just prototypes but later on in the game you might have to buy premium to succeed and not waste your entire summer break grinding dat highest tier of in conclusion the game is a rather nice to waste and spend your time on though it has its problems sometimes you have to get over it all in all i can recommend this game to anyone who loves air planes or tanks and the soon ships added
grand chase was way better than this game this game is boring as and player versus player system is dumb when the enemy is too good you cant even move no more this game sucks bring grand chase back even more fun this game is skin broken this game log grand chase four life
done let steam hours fool you live been playing this since beta on the normal client i literally downloaded this on steam just to throw my two cents in ill just say this if you enjoy other mobs you'll most likely enjoy smite that being said the game is undergoing a major shift and the developers are jumping ship they re going from hire example employee name to titan example employee name this is being used to distinguish between the two groups of hire one is project titan and the other is simply hire you can expect the eventual dropping of the original deus to the new ones half of the problems that the game is currently facing is due to inconsistency ill explain most players whether they re new or old can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent this being that you can queue for a match and if you re lucky enough to get in and not you are unable to be matched and are now the highest queue which literally resets your queue for another one thousand and fifteen minutes if you re lucky to get in you'll see one of two things one or multiple people on your team that are exceedingly low level and shouldn't be in your games or one or more enemies that are low level and shouldn't be in your games either way its simply not enjoyable of stomping some poor guy that a low level when he shouldn't be in your game int fun for anyone its not fun for him and its not fun for me and it actually has a high chance of running new players away matchmaking inconsistency is more often than not the cause for player frustration live been playing since the beta and in burned out i played literally ten games in a row and literally had trash players on my team that threw the game i should never be paired with less than stats sloppy matchmaking playing with friends should be fun live played countless hours with friends and one design flaw remains whomever queues for the game and is the party leader rules the matchmaking in normally the party leader and we typically get players between one hundred thousand one hundred and sixty aside from the low levels we get teamed with and while this is fine we have a few players that are new and have difficulty keeping up with players that are one hundred so to remedy this well have our low level player host and queue for matches and that where it becomes apparent that the matchmaking is literal trash because if he queues the party we go up against players that are his level not mine hire claims that the match making takes the cumulative level of the party and matchmaking rating and queues them with the players closest to themselves well we just proved that so now were in a game with players under thirty and in one hundred and thirty so i have two options i can of stomp these low level players or i can hang back and let them experience the game i done want to throw the game for us but i done want to be that player that farming lobbies that not fun for anyone and i want the player base to keep growing not shrinking go class favouritism is rampant you can clearly see which god classes are favored more than any of them just by looking at the numbers there are currently ninety eight gods out of those ninety eight there are twenty nine mages twenty assassins eighteen hunters fourteen warriors and seventeen guardians mages are the most overpowered and thusly the most played there are mages that are so ridiculous you cant close the gap to actually get to them this can be seen with gods like a such discord a baron not zeus vulcan it center its exceedingly rare that mages are bad however there are many gods that are simply in a terrible state such as rotator pele ratio terra king wei nike osiris it center part of this issue is that hire balances gods strictly around conquest their main mode the funny thing is most people done play conquest they play arena and assault to this end the game is unbalanced severely you jump into an assault which is a five versus five with random gods across the board and you fight an a such you re basically screwed he can keep more pressure on you than most players can get around if your team doesn't get a mage you re basically screwed gods like pele are fantastic in conquest shes designed to be a jungle and is the current best jungle out that being said on any other mode besides conquest shes utter trash this is part of a major problem for smite balancing the game for a mode that most people done play as admitted too by hire execs doesn't work it leads to people quitting due to frustration when all they want to do is play the damned game and have fun which is what games are supposed to be smite is literally flooded with to cosmetics that do nothing but take space in chests to prevent you from actually getting the skin you want you have one god skins two ward skins three avatars four loading frames five pedestals six social emotes seven recall skins eight had themes nine loading screen backgrounds ten jump stamps eleven fountain skins twelve level up skins thirteen death marks fourteen titles fifteen music themes sixteen announcer packs seventeen vas voice packs and you can bet your that all of these are filled the the brim with absolute trash that you done want but is just there as filler for chests hire is incredibly greedy and literally throws cosmetics in the way to make you spend more gem real world money on you done want just so you can maybe get the skin you want i cant prove it but in certain that chests are rigged so you only get the good skins at the end of the chests to put it simply if you pay two hundred gems for one chest rolls you'll most likely get and seeing as there are mostly fifty five items in one chest you re going to be shelling out a ton of money just to maybe get the skin you want this needs to be changed the sheer greed of hire shows in literally everything they do these are only a few of the problems there are so many bugs and issues in this game its absolutely insane in its current state i would not recommend anyone plays this unless you re interested in subpar games and shoddy matches misery simulator
if you re looking for a balanced game this is not the game for you match making balance is the worst aspect of this game and you would think it would be otherwise if you like playing against different era vehicles which outclass you in every way possible then this is the game for you it gets pretty to real in fast when you re in world war two era fighting the cold war era it gets real grind as well to research new vehicles most of the time you re on the end of the stick but every now and then you hold the stick and even then if you re team is incompetent done expect much from others its a love hate relationship with this game
early access review this game is a bad rendition of counterstrike but its really a rather fun shooter just something to waste time on really my bet though is that it wont have a good player base within a month
please be make new color only purchasable with mammoth coins and also make the three is three friendly mode a thing not just brawl of the week plus make free for all mode winner to who did most damage omega
early access review this game is so awesome i cannot wait to see the finished result please make things a bit cheaper we all work hard to play games and enjoy them online it is expensive and if we cannot afford to we cannot support the developers
long running game but if you have never played it definitely worth a shot the progression in the game is very lateral so mechanically the advantage a veteran can have over you is minimal and while early on you find fights to be a big mess once you learn a few of the basics and join squads tactics start to outstrip the raw numbers the starting gun is perfectly viable as the gun to use for the entire game and anything else just specialises into a specific role while having drawbacks if you do try it for the first time i would heavily suggest a support role until you understand the flow of the game frontline can be very unforgiving but there is a place for any player even if your aim is terrible the downside is if you prefer the lone wolf approach the learning curve to make that viable is huge as well as a very user unfriendly user interface menu system
of lets get this straight i love this game the only reason i would have to not like it is the fact that it is so hard to get our the currency without a membership therefore it is very difficult to purchase weapons and attachments other than that i absolutely love the game from the large scale battles where you can get pinned to one location its just adrenaline pumping and if you capture a base it can be taken from you by one of the three factions so you actually need more people than the two other factions to actually secure the location so all in all i would rate this game a eight hundred and ten eight mainly like i said the fact that it is very hard to get money without membership
starts at patch one hundred and twenty nine has at least one thousand hours without steam leaves at patch comes back at patch has good game two kills los out edna engine gets one spotted by a stray my bullet at pm away los out again gets caught on fire and wing ripped off from one burst by my bullets after unloading six hundred cal bullets into the enemy and only getting one hit los out again gets versed against i better in every way gets one spotted los out again gets one spotted from above with no one on radar max visibility los out again gets one spotted from above with no one on radar max visibility los out again gets one spotted from russian plane with arcadia flight model in re doing a turn los out again has good game gets one kill then cripples an enemy hurricane saves it for a teammate to score kill teammate misses and enemy turns around somehow despite his damage and pilot shots
early access review the game has gone completely downhill since the expansion being a unique card game that may be alluring for the prospect that the mana you ramp with is also a card in your hand that is ring that being said the game introduced many cards encouraging aggro play which doesn't need to ramp but just kill your opponent in four turns the heaviness of the ring that punishes intelligent and strategic game play and rewards mindless vanilla idiots not recommended for sanity reasons play hearthstone or something May
early access review purchased founders due to a lot of the promises that came from the development and emissaries around what they were going to do differently in this region none of these promises were true you basically have emissaries who are either fanboy liars and people now who know the truth and are speaking up about it i thought it was very odd they were not doing a beta event or any sort of testing in this region and this is why performance is abysmal on a and vega sixty our gets sometimes fifteen first person shooter in towns and can barely reach sixty other times translation is horrendous and you are going to have no idea what your moves do this is nothing more than a cash grab done do it and stay with another massively multiplayer online i appreciate steam for honouring the refund for a broken game and the deus living to the players
please even if you want this for your kids or you just like dragons stay away this game practically is impossible to enjoy for players who done pay nearly a one hundred for a membership you start off with two dragons a rumble horn free adult dragon for fetch quests and the one you hatch i will admit the colour customize is pretty neat but that where that stops all dragons apart from the whispering death egg you get for free later in the game you have to pay for you need gems to buy dragons the main selling point is locked behind a pay all as you cannot earn gems for free the game play is boring controls are bad and worse of all all of the quests are fetch or ask questions or those god damned hypothesis quests i will admit tho you can earn free stuff that costs gems by using coin chests randomly appearing chests that have a price of ninety coins one hundred and sixty coins they have a whopping two to give you a dragon egg and a measly fifty to give you a a a a a a a item to decorate that poor excuse for a farm village rip off save your time save your memory card space and more importantly keep your kids away from your credit card
early access review love the game but maybe you should add a thing where you can actually set the graphics to low or medium cause it is kinda unfair for people who done have good graphics

truly a timeless masterpiece no matter how badly valve tries to kill it please be warned the addiction its too much for any mortal man please i beg you look at how much time live wasted on this war based hat simulator sharon please they re my kids too i promise ill play less sobbing
if you re looking for fun done ever play this game it used to be way more simple and cool now it is just try ards and people who doesn't even try to have some fun playing they just want to win even if the game is not a ranked match always the same picks on the same games invoker broke the game and is probably picked in five every eight matches and win on four of them data two not reborn was way better and balanced it is also infested with smurfs done be surprised if you just started playing and you see someone with three hundred and forty two cd on your match not that its a problem for old players that use to smurf a lot nowadays but it kinda make new players forfeit playing this game for its so hard to have a match against people that actually started playing even though i think you should give it a try if you get used to these problems its a very good game and pretty addicting but i think i just had enough
early access review some aspects of the game are appealing including the large variety of vehicles however when it boils down to it the blatantly pay to win business model alienating anyone who doesn't whip out their credit card and floaty gunplay make this game only worth a bit of fun with friends rather than something you pour a lot of free time into
us of looks like something went wrong this the game please reload a one thousand seven hundred and forty two still in beta october no problem where are the saves tips steam community right no recovery october
path of exile now this is what all free play games should be like path of exile was the first game live ever played for personal computer considering i just got my personal computer and i am new to personal computer gaming i am extremely impressed on how this game is the community is very helpful wonderful and extremely nice pros beautiful graphics stunning mechanics amazing community not pay town guilds massive skill tree voice acting user interface and ain pcs are amazing variety of items pontormo etc cons its kind of a hard learning curve no more cons i can list when i first downloaded this game and started playing i was confused because there was no guidance to help me its a bit of a tough game to get use to in the start but whats you get the hang of it its actually very fun i chose not to write any more pros because its too much to write and i figured you guys should try it out for yourself now what i adore about this game is that you can have any weaponry item you want no matter what class you choose you can especially have two weapons i play as the ranger so if in in a tough situation i just switch over to my melee weapon you need to download and play this game please give it a try one million ten

yet again another so it design cancer infected card game fun at first until you only face the same overpowered cards exploit in your opponent hand say bye to skill and strategy the only way to win becomes to buy lose enough to gather the resources to craft the same overpowered or a a you face endlessly and pray for the luck to draw it first what a concept i personal hate it but you re of with that go ahead have fun no its not like those where rookies errors from beginner designer the imbalance is obvious they know it but that how you make people spend money in booster pack steve jobs and hitler would be proud
unfortunately i must say a true about this game the graphic from two thousand and six year optimisation non exist who the hell invent to put high resolution textures and effect to so old engine game run on do this engine even done use more than twelve cores of the cup you can have casa personal computer and the game still wanna lag and first person shooter will drop because this use only twelve cores game is ugly so many bugs so many glitches game play is stick and boring world is empty this game is no worth playing even for free i have go of ram cups cores twenty four threads my lgth ten seventy go and game even after reduce some effects to medium or low still drop under fps sometimes much lags and freezes
its a great game but once you get everything unless you are very creative to do stuff on your own or you have a community of people to build with this game becomes very boring and it pains me to say this even if i bought every single downloadable content and recipe pack in the game looking forward for the next big thing that creatives has to offer so that i can come back to it and get hooked one more time i want adventures in my own world i want that rare items become even rarer i want to work hard in order to have everything i want rather than to just keep chests full of every item but i still love the game
early access review all of text inbound great game amazing game i love this game to pieces at least i used to the game was awesome up until recently than crates arrived actually i shouldn't blame one update i suppose if i were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment id have to point my finger at the introduction of the cry this feature which id like to say was nice in concept intensified an already present issue within rob craft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today the cry allowed for the rapid deployment of overpowered bots or rather exploitative builds in going to use the tessera as an example while not a huge issue on its own it is the way free am went about resolving this issue that made matters worse to any veteran of the game that had some knowledge of the problem the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as arm or would be ineffective a more complex fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the builds arm or sadly free am did not choose these options and instead decided to add not but three now two but still weapons designed to deal with these builds while the build was successful in their intended task they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it this int a review whining about badly balanced a a though so onto the next nail shortly after this fiasco free am introduced epic loot a system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins nine times out of ten instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire they are now forced to test their luck with crates crates that logically fail to reward a player common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot this makes sense the crates free am has forced upon us do not follow such logic high tier crates rarely reward suitable loot in fact it would appear from my experience that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a players efforts this is in stupid period there also the complaint regarding the premium row flaunting items however this hast really annoyed me as much as others moving on to the big one a lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this games downfall if every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue as simple as this problem is it is so bad in fps case the simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge that someone looking in from the outside would likely see it as nothing more than a place for angry customers to vent why no deus will respond with exception of drug in but its his job as community manager and we love him for it three the deus that have a proper power over the games development use twitter instead of their own forums its dumb anyway as if this want long enough ill quickly list the pros and cons of the game so old pros one builders may be entertained if they get good stuff two not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap cons one deus are usually silent unless they re being praised two balance weapons what are those three exploit meta builds everywhere creativity does it seem to be a major concern to free am four hope you enjoy gambling i really like this game but sadly i cant recommend it to anyone because for one you re not rewarded for and the deus done seem to intent on fixing the issues may
alright to start off let me just say that this game was actually the first mob i played in my entire life i never really played any at all previously but this one caught my eye due to the mythology its an easy game once you get used to it a little more appealing than some of the other games out there like data or league of legends no matter how much they tell you otherwise this game takes a little concentration but after a while you'll get used to it and no doubt enjoy it pros wide variety of mythological characters to fit your play style game modes are easy and fun to play addicting always adding more and more items and gods into the game no need to pay anything in the game everything is free unless you want to boost yourself and buy some gems to help out not only you but hire cons teamwork is needed but you done always get it in public matches some gods need obvious nerds some gods need obvious buffs occasional server la issues the amount of badmouthing from other players is immense overall id play this game with a few friends going into public matches tend to lead to bad teammates constantly badmouthing and being a general annoyance but the game play and variety makes up for it in the long haul i definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in a good and well paced mob
early access review have played this game for about thirteen years and they've added awesome things to change the game but now it doesn't have the awesome game play aspects it use to have because they made it a pay to play type game when they added the epic loot update the game just int what it used to be now so i cant recommend this game like i used to to my friends like i said the other updates were awesome but this update completely changed the game in a bad way for the players who have played this game from the beginning
well smite is mob game that came of in twenty twelves and in twenty fifteen got onto steam this time its all about mythological gods and it positions itself as mob that has the third person style game play instead of feeling like war craft three leftover and yea they kept updating it shame that no waist snake babe anymore though nothing that cost money seems to affect game play unless unlocking gods the game also comes with easy anti cheat with set me off at first after all its offered separately on steam just for counterstrike where it often conflicts with valve vac and also takes screenshots of your desktop apparently it does it only for counter strike and everybody else is safe at least it closes properly when you close smite aha anti viruses may not like it when installing and setting up the game though and well i thought that its just going to be a generic mob with a camera slapped behind the characters but nope while there int much of difference when playing melee attack characters still being able to hit just one single target and all anything ranged is a different story you actually have to aim this alone makes it much better than data likes as far as i care there are no war craft three magically homing projectiles at least for normal attacks the abilities also have various hit areas whether a circle or a line as example there is this keith who has mighty jiggle physics and best ever victory animation her first ability is penetrative arrow first you have have to aim this line down and use the ability after that keith will aim the bow now allowing you to change the angle anymore however you are still free to move and thus you are still able to reposition yourself in order to hit the target of course enemy players a rent afraid of strafing you slow down when attacking so watch out plus a lot of abilities are rather smart being something simple yet with multiple usage such as ice elemental talkie golem thing being able to create ice wall having a long range to set it up also the game has jumping but its just a silly animation for those who feel bothered not being able to jump when controlling the characters directly developers done want it to affect game play unless exploits or bugs the terrain is all flat anyway the game also includes the auto features for both shopping and selecting ability on level up the latter int that much needed the auto shopping on another hand helps new players to just focus on interacting with others and fighting when they a rent sure if game is worth of their time spending looking at all the stats and numerical details pretty great albeit of course its not as good as manual build otherwise of course it still has that mob feel it still has towers and creeps running along lanes the combat flow is still pretty funny in a silly sense at one moment players are attempting to poke each other at range and then in another situation they all gang up on each other and nuke area with ability spam in ten seconds but hey the game also comes with many various modes usual mob big map with three lanes the two lanes one one lane with small sideways a simple linear path which has random heroes selectable about as dumb as deathwatch modes in team games and a small arena mode something for everyone taste otherwise yep the only mob i shall care about so far even if its not pure mob so that means that i still sorta done like mobs but hey what cha gonna do also music rocks May
strangely addictive not much to the game but one you can have on in the background as you watch to updates all the time so always something new one of those games you just have to beat recommend to all who done want anything to taxing
early access review this game is sack of its poorly optimised badly designed and you literally cant uninstall it properly maybe if they weren't so shady with their business practices i wouldn't have been so aggressive but seriously whoever made this game
the moment i started playing i got addicted to the game i would recommend this game to everyone the legends designs are amazing the work that has been put into every weapon and legend is incredible
pro pretty graphics good combat mechanics everywhere you can find people so you done feel lonely in any are story is good and makes you want to play more and quests are challenging undead for the watchman classes consol boy the system requirements are a lie i perfectly meet the system requirements but i cant play comfortably even tho i got the graphics at low the game is really unbalanced in player versus player mode the mag generally mage classes is overpowered as hell its nearly impossible to get the best weapons armour in the game because you need lose your life by grinding all day long too many in game currencies when i first played i was completely overwhelmed from the many currencies that are into the game i got really confused and felt utterly stupid the worst con is the fact that the developers focus only on how they will make money by making only new content when there are many things needed to be fixed am pretty sure my review is nothing different from the other negative reviews but i felt like i should write my review and express my own opinion about this games personally give this game a even though pros were more than the cons cons had a significant impact on the game and made it enjoyable thanks for your time
great game its my second day playing it and its just awesome i love it i really recommend this game to any video game players boys or girls for the first time i saw it before like one year i tough its total crap just kind of cartoon style first person shooter with bad controls but actually its better than cod modern warfare plus it got voice chat so you can chat with your friends and it too got normal chat i love trading items from this game with friends love this game
early access review hello players might be a bit biased in this review and no offence to the developers but the game sucks i could have given it a positive review a year ago before the update before it was clear tiers people played with people who are the same tier as them and the game was more or less balanced i mean there was at least some balance of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you even if they killed you that was fair enough you cold just face it and you could see by their blocks colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them the update messed up the game now textures were removed colours for each tier block where removed and what to can colour your mark ten tier ten blocks white and everybody will attack you and you just re them also before go galaxy cash had a higher value you could buy a megabit for like five dollars go or could build a boot for ten euros like super mega tier seven or prebuilt maggot now the cheapest crappiest robot costs thirty euros like a call of duty or sta a game tier system was messed up now worst players play with best players a hell your like to and a wild megabit appears from somewhere and wrecks you laugh out loud if you think differently comment sorry for biased opinion yours anton
i downloaded this game just to say how much it sucks also i been waiting four hours now for it to come out of maintenance anyways all the positive reviews are from fake accounts just check for yourself also not pay to win then why do they offer micro transactions that offer a slight boost to levelling last i knew that pay to win if you pay real money and level faster what a joke this game is trash change my mind
most amazing combat flight simulator but overpriced i wont buy a plane for sixty euros are a fucking us cd i and and a crazy i can buy two games instead a nice priced game put down the price do not be a jerk
path of exile has been almost nonstop fun since i picked it up in closed beta at the end of two thousand and eleven live put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit steam if you like diabolo you will likely enjoy poe this is the spiritual successor to diabolo two prepare yourself though this int as simple as diabolo three and requires a lot more planning thought and testing to have an effective build match of exile is a game where you ask in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how you re going to set up your future passive skill points the mechanics of combat damage and character resources health mana energy shield arm or it center are very well thought out and make for strong arg combat as a spiritual successor to the diabolo line should be early game the first nineteen levels has a little more variety than a per character but after level nineteen your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills provided you can get them from a master or another player or find them as drops game play is varied but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running gas over and over i personally find does grind more fun because there more i can do while grinding and there a large active community in each league and i can chat and get responses and conversations at any time overall its a modern diabolo two experience with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than diabolo two but in each respect is more rewarding than is more loot less game play twist on the diabolo recipe you will be tested and you will be found wanting just try to survive edit how many expansions in are we now four four free expansions three of which are more content rich than the diabolo two expansion and all of which have more content than diabolo space seriously give this game a go its free its fun its awesome
early access review even though i give this game a seven hundred and ten its not too bad the only problem i have is the levelling system i know its only in beta but i checked their site so at least they are listening to people
the game diabolo three should have been when you look at path of exiles with its small team of developers and at least when they started the limited amount of cash they must have had and then you look at blizzard with their war chest and you compare diabolo three and poe and you can clearly see how much better game this one is the only micro transactions are for cosmetics you sometimes wonder how this people even eat i have hrs because i jump from game to game like a grasshopper but the hrs live put into this game live enjoyed every bit of it
early access review absolutely loving the game especially like the true free to play aspects where grinding earns you a great am out of cards and gold every format from artificial intelligence to player versus player is a blast and every game feel meaningful as you build your collection highly recommend if you are sick of hearthstone ring then make the switch to eternal today it really is the best of mtg and is combined
this is one of the rare few times i will write a serious review so read carefully trove is a over addicting game with countless hours of game play even though i only have thirty hours into trove i highly recommend it if you like adventure games now lets move to pros and cons show we pros a very fun and addicting game that is actually free to play item gear rankings the higher the gear the better once you get to user one and above its a every time legendary very smooth frames and fun game play mechanics each class is something new not just a recycled concept which can lead to hours of fun game plano player versus player which means no overpowered user five players kick new players arses in combat club worlds create a club and a club world where only you and your friends can hang and build together each dungeon is equal meaning that a pirate biome dungeon int harder then a cursed vale dungeon biome shadow levels increase you level from the max of twenty cons the game can get very tedious grinding for flu the game can also be very tedious trying to get a legendary or higher if you done improve your magic find you must pay attention to the tutorial or you will get very lost mid game although they are fixing this queue times are very long on weekends due to weekend traffic if you run out of potions mid battle with a dungeon boss your screwed corner stones can be hard to find at time you have to mine for materials to make new portals to user one and above mushrooms find that challenging dungeons at user three and love can prove to be very difficult at times wings done come to you early and are quite hard to obtain you are stuck to one class and cannot change unless you collect cubits daily or spend in game currency final thoughts trove is a very fun game and i highly recommend it while it may seem that some of my cons are a bit bias or even very true the game has a lot of pros that will make up for them its also worth mentioning the game never once puts you in a post on that makes it seem like spending real life money is a must if you like single player open world adventure games or even a multiplayer play with your friends game then trove is the game for you also i personally recommend the neon ninja and the shadow hunter for beginners but mostly neon ninja if you like to be up in the front lines shadow hunter is a ranged class requires more brainpower and strategy may
live returned to the game after the big recent patch and i am really enjoying it again i haunt played for quite a while before rejoining probably a year plus immediately after the patch there was a problem dragging cards which has now been patched you seem to need to drag them by the bottom half but meh easy enough to make that mental change until they fix it fully which in sure they will great game play can play a quick game or two for twenty minutes or lose hours in it seems reasonably balanced most cards have counters if you build a deck with some thought you can ponder over card combinations for many hours too without even playing a hand just honestly cant see the hate is deserved turn that frown upside down barf the deus of course need to take into account the feelings of players and in sure they will and give it a month or two to get patched back up and i hope that mostly negative in recent reviews will turn positive i love the clever emote system too though it is a tiny tad limited would be good to see that expanded a bit so anyhow i look forward to seeing you in game where i will kill you without mercy but will make sure i do it politely
got to say it is a pretty good and little addictive game great for a quick play or long sessions one thing live noticed since using a ultra wide two thousand five hundred and sixty a one thousand and eighty is to try and avoid zooming out too far and then moving the map it tends to freak out and disappear it will come back when you zoom back in
truly this game is the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of idle clicker games i will start by saying this the game mechanic is fun and the game itself is enjoyable the team formatting is unique and diverse that being said this game represents all of the unbridled greed that game developers seem to find themselves filled with these days in terms of raw micro transaction cost this game is the most expensive game on the market in addition this game has been out for quite some time on congregate com prior to being released on steam as a game developer i find congregate to be a great community and live enjoyed seeing other titles such as adventure capitalist time clickers and clicker heroes make amazing transitions over to the steam community the same can not be said for this game why all the aforementioned titles all had one thing in common if you spent money on in game micro transactions on congregate all of those bonuses carried over to the steam platform players were given the ability to export their save game code and then import it once on steam even for idle clicker games that are only on congregate this is common practice at this point it has become an expected best practices within the industry crusaders of the lost idols does not do this congregate users have been calling for ages for the ability to import export save codes even more so once it was announced that this title would be being released on steam users repeatedly reached out to the developers attempting to make contact with them the deus were silent for over four months finally one day the deus decided to finally appease the masses and actually engage themselves with their community that when we all discovered the awful truth the deus were simply trying to rob their players the developers announced they were making the conscious choice to refuse data transfers to players in their community who spent real money on in game bonuses spent fifty on chests when the game was first released on congregate only well you done get to keep those bonuses better spend another fifty if you want all your perks again he while i have not ever spent money on this game and have thus not lost out due to this i find this to be one of the most unethical decisions i have seen a none blizzard game developer make it undermines the entire indie community despite the fun game play due to the under handedness of the developers i would advise everyone to avoid this game and not support it heck since its free to play install it then down vote it with a review players and consumers in general need to take a stand against greedy developers like code name
early access review its early access but the graphics are dingy you have tons of hackers lag absolute crap for weapon balance insanely low recoil spread even cod has more combat feels shallow and uninspired needs a ton of work to even be fun especially to be matched with people who actually speak english or live anywhere near to the states overall rating three thousand five hundred and ten would not recommend
early access review for in games only have minor problem so far but after i disconnected from in game live been stuck forever at forty when i try to relaunch the games gave up so i decided to refund this game
early access review a thoroughly enjoyable game to play alone and with friends i can imagine this would be brilliant at party for people with very little gaming experience the game int endlessly playable but is very enjoyable indeed despite this i can see this int a game for some people but give it a try it is free
flaming cliffs three is a good module to get you started in the game simple to use and iconic aircraft make sure you have a hot as setup anything from the cheaper thrust master to up to a thrust master warthog works fine also you need either a tracker or of racetrack playstation three camera or something to track your head movement not a game for someone who is not an aviation enthusiast you really need to understand some basics of kinematics and pulse doppler radar the game kind of teaches you a little bit but your better off learning via youtube all in all though this is hands down the best combat flight simulator available to civilian consumers on the market but not for those that are looking for an arcade experience
early access review the game itself has a lot of potentials but recent changes epic loot update indicate the developer lacks foresight in looking after the player base significant changes a a ninety nine drop in income were pushed out just like that without being tested a a in a test server when asked for justification the developer simply stated the changes were fair and balanced whereas some players would go into detail on how they are not the improper management of the game development drives this game backward
early access review great idea solid game solid graphics for free to play only problem is the two thousand five hundred and thirty minutes wait time for matchmaking which is a bummer because this game actually has solid potential
of so i download this game despite the and some odd number of negative reviews and to my surprise there it is not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buys but a pay to win then after three or so months pay to win again as soon as i loaded the game up the first screen that pops up is the purchase screen so this tells me that this is nothing but a milk machine for the speedy developers that made this and once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hands and a camera so upon further investigation of the getting a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the launcher to get equipped with something so i knew that being a free to player i wouldn't get the best but i got the absolute worst i got some crappy gun that looks like it was textured in playstation two era and i still have to buy ammo which costs in game currency so i go to buy some and nope i got no starting cash so basically it was trying to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for a free gun i feel like this should be labeled as a bad game and taken off steam due to the three thousand some odd number negative reviews saying it was a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people i am going to try and contact the developers to see if i did something wrong and how i can fix it and i might change my review
early access review this game is actually very good its still in alpha but the performance is of there a decent amount of ships and the battles are a lot of fun once you figured out the mechanics and the controls currently there only one map and one game mode but its still loads of fun playing done be discouraged if you get wrecked during your first few games it will take a little time until you know when to engage and when to run probably the most important skill in this game and equal mix of tactics and piloting skill is key to success
early access review games is pretty much unplayable you take quest quest mob is spawned you kill it then server acknowledge that you have taken the quest and require you to kill a mob that is slain due to it being so try a you can no retake it have fun deleting your character
so first i started playing trove back in twenty fourteen and i personally really enjoyed it in a man of all kind of games and i assure you if you are into grinding and you a rent very effected by repetitively then i would recommend it however if you a rent i would not recommend it but i started trying the game again in twenty eighteen and i really enjoyed it i hit a thousand hours and maxed out numerous characters got all the dragons spend roughly twenty five and i enjoyed the experience i recommend
worst pay to win shooting game how it works join a game attempt to kill someone and get sniped you have to pay money to unlock weapons then you have to spend much more money to buy the weapon money int easily obtained in the game go try ghost in the shell or warfare better
this game is pay to win how you ask well let me just say this i was playing my first casual joust match when i noticed a character was flying above me he then landed on me and killed me with some finger pistols or some apparently it was the god apollo i thought huh that kinda seems unfair there a god that can just fly above you in this game and become completely unmarketable that so in to but i let it slide mind you apollo is not even a default god and you need a currency called gems to buy gods in this game there is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money so after my horrific encounter with apollo i queued again and i faced off against the gods to huang thanatos and guess who get again yep you guessed it apollo i suddenly noticed that these gods can all take to the sky and not only that but to top it off to huang and thanatos ultimate just instantly kill you and there no way to escape it you just instantly die and it heals to huang and then he can fly away and do even more damage so after my teammate got eaten by an to huang which then landed on me killing me i just uninstalled none of these gods are default gods and all cost real money of yeah and before i even started playing there some gods they released that they didst even finish causing massive balance issues such as hel ratio and all they released them without any ultimate abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game if hire fixes these things i will make my review positive but as if now i can not recommend this game old pay to win game with no updates since twenty fourteen after deus abandoned the game dead community and extreme balance issues
early access review retro first person shooter once we fix the hackers and cheats this could be a little gem it takes me back to old first person shooter style which i like and this is free so you done have anything to lose just your time
early access review after playing this game for thirty nine hours i can honestly say this game is incredible its a perfect break from the hear raising first person shooters that we all know and love after playing for a awhile i have learned that there is no one character that is better than the other but rather characters that each have their strengths and weaknesses live played for thirty nine hours and ill play for thirty nine more i highly recommend this game its too much fun
the game mechanics and ranking is completely broken the same people play at the same time every day so people are in skill bubbles for the time that they play furthered by the game being free so people smurf on low level accounts and two people matched together low ranking even if one of the people is a high rank this completely destroys the ranked game modes and makes it unplayable anyone who says this game has a scene is lying if you are used to being thirteen hundreds at pm good game at am totally not the same skill level getting leo up is a hell not worth the time all the new chars are released overpowered on purpose and cost extra coins this int a one time thing and completely breaks game until they decide to fix it furthermore all the mechanics are focus around how your char is broken based on what weapon they have some do auto locking attacks other have auto combos some spam hard others charge half way across the map in one attack this int real mechanics this is just a bunch of game breaking things thrown together some chars will always lose to others based on the moves they are given each char with the same weapon pretty much plays the exact same the way the button layouts work it is very hard to use some of the attacks since they are tied into your mouse and keyboard directional keys most people just cry spammer when they are killed even though half the chars are designed to be spammers some chars you never see people play because they cant handle being auto locked the hit boxes are awful and some chars have no combos
early access reviewing of elysium roe is one of the best battle royal games i have played i really like the aspect of classes being involved in a game like this all three of the classes are very fun and very helpful to the game recommended the game to all my friends and all of them love it see a lot of potential
a word of warning purchasing the pc alone without the flaming cliffs three purchase does not include tutorials on how to fly the plane however its easy and you done have a job so youtube it worth the us russian jet that comes free is a terrible example of the game because its bad that why its free just bought the pc and the game is fun now if you re an a warthog fan like me just be aware there are different versions one is a simplified variant the other for people who done have jobs like you so you should be fine right shift light home right alt home it carl a page up xxx hold a page up hold afterburner release take to the skies rush a but seriously this game is excellent
definitely one of the best clicker games live ever played i bought all the things to support the developers that give me a few benefits but it feels like my progression might be sped up a bit too much with these bonuses i know i can turn them off but then it feels like a waste of money when you ascend and you have all those bonuses you can skip a huge amount of time every single time if you just start out you also get as much progress in no time as someone who didst start out with those bonuses i had played this for about five days without bonuses my friend bought the bonuses and was instantly on my progress so i also bought them all in all a very good in depth clicker game that id recommend to anyone just wish the bonuses from buying the extra things weren't so insane
team fortress two has been ruined by this recent update hopefully valve will bring back the old team fortress two someday team fortress two was amazing already newest update ruined it i mean like seriously why do you need competitive for casual cant we have fun without the confusing update the community wants the old team fortress two back
i am a long time player of smite i have one thousand hours of record game time and for me smite is the master race of mobs but every patch has become a nightmare i always get errors at launch and it got so bad that i haven been able to play it for the last two months and i even lost two already paid events during that time throwing fifty to thrash cant get a refund obviously crash report doesn't respond to me i am very furious i need help plus hire do something about these errors i am tired of downloading and deleting smite every month
early access review horrible launch very disappointed at their network engineers their outlook on have a solid optimization plan in effect while i understand that you can not predict everything launch being critical at ironing out the presenting issues of massive connections you can tell that the framework they re using can not sustain the large player base this is an issue of be at its core the framework they present to work along with the build of the game there is a reason proper made games focus on their net code firstly take notice if they will have to reconstruct the game engine or build one from scratch all of these issues are as bright a day to see for everyone as a developer someone who tinkers with be aside from what live said earlier the game is still meh live played jerry bless all of which still present to me that they have not even taken seriously to build their game environment basic shade basic materials assets almost feels like they've made this game with the blueprint design feature be offers and not a language the game environment feels empty and just basic as if someone just placed assets all over the world with no care and that it skill usage still feels very basic although i would say much better than before the rebuild of the game user interface clunky cheap feelings almost as if the user interface is still a prototype such an awesome take on the mount system yet they mess it up with having a stamina system stamina goes down very quick jumping kills it so fast its ridiculous i done know what the deus were thinking when they introduced this especially with the world being so big quality of skin effects costumes int so bad i enjoyed it not much content to do really dungeons or monster quest killing is just about all you re really going to be doing besides player versus player being end game which by the way i done see be enjoyable with such performance and network issues over all this game is still so incomplete i would consider the state of this game alpha to or alpha bless after all the issues you have had you should be letting us play this game for free you should provide us with proof that your game is in a better state rather than charging us for packs pure silliness i want going to buy this game at all but i said why the heck not let me give the deus a chance well i did steam has now refunded me this game is not worth thirty or forty dollars i would say these issues wouldn't be too bad with a free release let us test the game for you good luck on future endeavours bless in out
product received for free early access review really do enjoy this game its fun for me but since recent updates the game has simply felt pay to win and whoever has more tanks wins no matter what
team fortress two a great game transformed over the years into a shape that i no longer recognise nor love having quit the game for around a year whilst still following updates what i say may seem harsh but i say it because team fortress two may still have the potential to be a great game again in my opinion team fortress two has been neglected lopsided balance and long existing bugs left unaddressed for years whilst in recent months they have attempted to address such problems they ultimately left them too late visually the game has changed a lot mainly due to horrendous looking outlandish cosmetic items being added that didst even try to match the original art style not forgetting the various visual changes that may be intentional or not that have also decreased the quality of how the game appears for example on older maps lighting is screwed up as are several decorative decals found on those maps that are now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release i done want to list every issue like this as i understand they are likely this way due to either optimisation or updates to the source engine over the years that have caused such parts of the game to break the biggest nail in tvs coffin for me was the removal of pubs in favour of an overeat cheque matchmaking system completely changing how the majority would play drop in and drop out was one of the major appeals for me and it is one of the defining reasons i quit this game the more casual atmosphere of pubs was enjoyable and the options for man versus machine and even competitive center it center not the terrible competitive they did add were there for those looking for a more coordinated experience man versus machine was an enjoyable part of my playtime personally however as mentioned earlier the lopsided balance of team fortress two was only amplified here whenever they did change weapon stats they completely forgot to consider any effect they would have on man versus machine should valve decide to allocate more staff to team fortress two perhaps one day it will return to a state where i can safely say i love this game again however with the small handful that does work on team fortress two this is rather unlikely May
started on arm or games found it here for a desktop copy over twenty five reincarnations and counting i probably have four thousand hours idling on this game but it says something like three hundred cause its been up another one thousand six hundred now absolutely love the work done on this game and you can tell the team has passion for gaming as a priority in their design elegant simple yet subtle complex cant recommend it higher for an idle game since the only one that comes even close to this level of quality is the semi idle game shakes fidget
and has grown up and it has aged well all the great mechanics of the well esteemed tabletop role playing game with the perks of any massively multiplayer online role playing game i haven played never winter for that long but i know its gonna be great
early access review a combo combo game of a century with next gen graphics surpassing call of duties black oops three this game will soon be release on box soon with the new character a rude hi tori
i would usually love this type of game but something about it maybe the fact that you have to just wait for hours at a time to farm money yeah its boring do not waist your time
i loved this game but a lot has changed since i first started playing back when i first made a review for this game but now sadly it is a grind to play from level six thousand and seventy its a shame they made it such a drag from six thousand and seventy when level one hundred and sixty was a breeze plus it is such a boring grind to get good gear now i worked so hard to get the demonic gear live got which back then was one of the best armours to have but now when i play in weak i used to go into all areas and kill the monsters easily but now there is so many areas that are red because they are too difficult for me i really cant be bothered spending many many hours grinding for good gear again i still go back and play occasionally and i still like it but i cant play for the many hours at a time like i used to i get bored much quicker
i wish i could recommend this game if only you could jump on and assemble disassemble your gun of choice however you simply cannot you have to pay real monies to unlock guns like them block nineteen rem eight hundred and seventy and many others instead you start off tinkering with guns you may have no experience or expertise with for this reason i cannot recommend this game just charge pal like ten for the game and include all guns stop the gun control May
imagine that chess was only playable online and a single company was uncharged of promoting sustaining it but suddenly that company decided to turn chess into checkers and you cannot ever play chess again surely it would only and obviously be a matter of adapting yourself to the new game right i mean chess is just like checkers if you re not capable of adapting yourself to it then there are no doubts that you are a bad chess player and you should resort to playing chinese checkers or monopoly this pretty much sums up what is happening to data right now seven hundred is a big back to your face if you enjoyed what the game was before it
early access review finally someone did a true magic the gathering hearthstone maxim an old time mtg player think one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and hearthstone legend player and i admit the game looks really fun heres what became apparent after a few games hearthstone influence battlegrounds look and feel the same lots of battle cry summon death rattle tomb effects hero weapons mtg influence a targeted attacks blocks made by defender you have lands vigils creatures are healed at end of turn flying trample overwhelm instant effects played in other players turn mtg style mulligan is i love the fact that you can use a for attack all wish hearthstone had something like this
this game is fun even tho its pay to win since there are still some items that are earned not bought so i think this game still would be one of my favourites compared to a lot of other mos
early access review black squad plays out like counter strike global offensive except faster with more weapons attachments and the ability to aim down sight basic mechanics like system it center are almost identical to logos you run faster with your knife out and there is even a key bind for inspecting your weapon pros shooting feels good kills feel satisfying and meaty aim and reaction time are rewarded extremely sniper friendly sniper rifles are significantly more powerful than the asp is in counter strike global offensive extremely well optimized he supported very good graphics for a free to play game are super very player friendly free to play model vast majority of in game weapons are easily obtainable with normal currency decent maps people complaining about the small maps are talking about the deathwatch maps wide set of options decent builtin crosshair optimization multiple interesting and unique game modes defuse via assassination etc attlee anti cheat is more robust than vac pretty good net code hit registration seems very solid cons not enough weapons they will surely keep adding weapons deathwatch maps are too small grenade physics rental system are worse than so no ranked competitive system this may come in the future play this game it could easily be fifteen dollars but its free may
barring the artificial intelligence this is a brilliant flight sim i see in all the negative reviews complaints about complex controls this is not area where planes and helicopters model less than a quarter of the systems they have this is a realistic combat flight sim if you done have a joystick you are not going to enjoy this sim note that even game mode is more realistic than area to those who think this is just another free to play money grab each module has about the same amount of time put into them as each complete battlefield game maybe not combined arms pros extremely detailed systems modelling for the a ten a attack jet a and a although controls can be frustrating without a tracker very high detail graphics wise free updates add to the sim as well as fix things the engine is also updated sometimes for more functionality very large range of vehicles and aircraft to fight against cons poor artificial intelligence without extensive scripting in the editor they overuse afterburner and run out of fuel when they reach their target miss enter dogfights rather than outrun their enemies ground units can see through forests and buildings helicopter gunships fly high when attacking and almost never hover it center some aircraft have lower resolution textures that look ugly virtually unplayable without a joystick but that is once again expected
early access review realm royal at this stage has a lot going for it for anyone seeking more engaging battle royal games if you are not a fan of games like footnote or battlegrounds this game probably int for you but if you re looking for more in depth game play interesting twists on the still burgeoning hallmarks of battle arenas and better map variety then you will certainly have fun with this game what makes it good uses of classes and abilities allows for variety of play each has their own basic mobility move while you can go out and hunt for more abilities that plays to the strengths of your class not only is it good variety but allows for coordination with teams and duo the implementation of shards gives you good reason to keep searching chests and crates as you can go to the forge and make potions abilities and legendary arm or for yourself the forge adds risk and additional objectives on the map potential hot spots for combat mounts and how easy it is to use them some people might not like the ability to quickly get across the map as it might detract from the use of the fog but i think it just speeds things up and allows for more expedient ways to get back into combat what needs improvement sword dagger play its a little unwieldy to swing a sword the animation doesn't look very good if you re gonna put in more melee weapons add some flair to the fighting style of it armoury and shop nothing has been added yet as it is alpha but id really hate if it went like footnote and put everything behind a damn pay all otherwise playing the game without it is useless and boring better skinned weapons some of them get really ugly
early access review this game i installed because i wanted to meme it up with my friends in discord about playing this game this game was surprisingly entertaining and the people were really nice like super nice a game
picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting especially being free i was wrong the developers put a lot of work into this game the models in game are based on real world models every part is labeled with its correct name down to the smallest pins rollers and springs if you are detail oriented mechanically minded or simply curious this will be up your alley whether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function check this game out i done even consider this to be a game but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side there are pay aspects but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns such as military vehicles race cars even skeletons it center as for progression within the gun world its free the game consists of assembly dis assembly function games including a firing range and even painting the firearms you can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can without hasty clicks and without errors for extra points its very challenging and in adept at this using actual firearms the ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm even while firing reloading safety on off it center this is what i liked the most about it in the real world one can take apart an actual gun learn the names of the parts and understand the basic functions but to see the pieces in action while inside the gun gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together the models are pretty good looking too they a rent super high res but they a rent lowers either my only two complaints with this game the way one moves around the gun arts to get a different angle is awkward sometimes frustrating but its not game breaking bad not by any means just an annoyance at times some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be for example the a one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle butt before removing the rifle butt in real life the game penalizes the player if the pouch int removed first though this problem is more of a developers attitude of you have to follow my procedure even if its not necessary in the real world this is not game breaking either but very frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors overall i would recommend this game one hundred thousand nine hundred and ten
best a simulator as real pilot told us today i believe him its really the best simulator but hard to learn too that why its a best warplane simulator but there are minuses too tanks can drive trough the buildings for example in real world building collapses or something but not here but off course its a plane simulator first not a tank simulator
early access review the game was so nice i done know why people keep giving negative reviews but there still lots of bugs and the mechanics of this game was so hard overall this game is nice seven thousand three hundred and ten
a fascinating and extremely interesting and as the name implies creative sandbox game it goes to show that the people at playful corp really put a lot of love into this game as it is in constant development and always expanding creatives does have its limitations there are occasional technical challenges to overcome but overall the experience is great and the community support for solving problems is very considerate i can only see good things to come with all the options and beautiful blocks and devices and such that they are continually introducing its enough to keep your imagination and creativity sparked for thousands of gaming hours two thumbs up for this sandbox game
early access reviewing enjoyed creatives quite a bit from earning my way to newer and better recipes to actually having to go above ground for some materials its kept me hooked i also like the free servers and that you can set your world to just people you want to have in it via password i hope the free servers stick around and that when it goes to free to play the micro transactions done hinder actual game play this is a great game now and can only keep going i think keep up the good work playful corporation
dress up in your favourite colour as each soldier on the battlefield has an identity crisis as to who they are empty your wallets as the next wacky cosmetic comes out bear rage as the opposing faction outnumbers you in every battle find yourself battling on indra seventy of the time you play this game fly in detriment as ace pilots dominate the skies base design tactics you re out of luck if you want to find a good leader step up and do what other people wont the only thing truly worth station cash are the bundles done let medley trick you in this int a review this is commentary only hope the game gets a tad bit better each month
the storyline was alright but not really that engaging its we game so its pay to win the character creation is basic classes are basic with very limited weapon and arm or selection
early access review the game is great but id like to tell you my opinion then give you a overall summary some of the ships look like they are covered in foil and are all glittery which is kinda weird not much in the way of upgrades and its impossible to customize the ships in any way the crew members sound weird i thought i would be able to actually command a fleet of ships like at least twenty at the same time in a game but i can only use one and done get me wrong its fun but its just kinda underwhelming overall i would give this game a six out of ten mainly because customization and upgrading a rent great at the moment and would like to see a lot more variety and if they could add some more ships that would be even better
where do i start well first of all its a simulator i knew that i wouldn't go shoot twenty deer in two minutes but holy live played the game for more than sixty minutes and i couldn't kill anything after i started the game i found myself running up a hill for ten minutes running because you run like faster than you walk and you walk really slow when i got there i found some poop and a red arrow above it which pointed me to a direction where something should have been after another ten minutes of following poop trails i final found a wild boar when i looked through my rifle scope and aimed at the animal it said you need a license to hunt this animal couldn't be live it i shot it anyway to see what happens my bullet didst do anything greats then i found out that you have to buy the license for real money the rest of the time i tried to find another animal i had some sort of deer call noise can in my inventory but it didst had any effect what so ever so at the end i just rage quit this game takes a lot of patience like an inhuman amount of patience this is not entertainment
at the beginning i didst know how to dodge kept losing then just uninstalled the game about six months later one of my friends introduced me to the game again i was hooked very fun fast paced fighting game one of my favourite games by far keep up the good work blue mammoth games update now that the game has been out for some time now and i have one thousand hours on it it is still an amazing game and overall now that it is on the consoles it is even better when it comes to the future of brawl all
alright so live played a little bit of this game and what i find most about it is that its repetitive very repetitive will i keep playing probably but i cant give this game a good review as much as in sure all of you would like this to be a good review now when i say its repetitive i mean that the storyline is practically the same for all characters ill admit the game play is slightly different for some characters and the job changes offer a small bit of interest for all of five minutes but overall the game play becomes repetitive the quests are just meh and quite frankly the pay to have overpowered stuff tactic is poor design old the game play is repetitive the quests are repetitive the characters done feel different enough and done get me started on the in game real money shop i appreciate that the deus put a lot of time into this but quite frankly i done care for it this game rates at three thousand two hundred and ten from me and even that i feel is too generous
been playing he for over a year stop playing twelve weeks ago got back into the game in the last weeks downloaded the update the game play has gone down hill real quick it use to be a fun game to play it had its problems here and there but good game to play but now its unplayable i couldn't recommend this rubbish to anyone sad to see a good game go down the drain
early access review hours in i am feeling pretty positive about the game and the way it looks and feels i ran it on a entry level laptop to gents bob do performance was beyond good in frowning at you pub no lag encountered yet and no glitch except a door closing glitch where you get stuck if in between or you'll be thrown back inside roswell optimised small size brilliant environment design its free console die in a snap recoil is unforgiving player base is too small for enjoyment as of creation of this review huge maps feels empty too empty at average ten minutes or so go without any encounter
this is a nope game for a nope somebody i tell you download at your own risk this is a horrible nightmare causing game it also breaks your three thousand dollar computer if your not careful enough from claiming it in fear but if you want to impress your friends speed run this you wont no balls
slow to load takes a couple rounds of rocket league to load while not giving any indication of the progress and slow to run i wouldn't recommend this there are other games out there that albeit with lesser graphics provide a much better flying experience
early access review the first person shooter in this game is so awful that i cant go into any town areas as that makes it so bad that its as good as having your game freeze additionally when the game developers decided every class was doing too much damage they nerved each class by eighty and no that not an exaggeration naturally this made it near impossible to finish any story quests with more than one enemy not to mention any dungeons i might be able to put up with that but the first person shooter is the worst which they wont even a knowledge despite hundreds of players screaming about it on twitter it center done buy this game until after they've fixed such issues after that it might be worth it
great game with many heroes to pick from and fight against its definitely worth your time but do remember that hire studios the developers and publishers are abs lout cancer and most of their games are bad smite however is the exception and is good fun with friends or alone
early access review graphics are pretty although generic the game hitches a lot and you are forced into player versus player zones to do the main quest line you can use peace declarations to not get attacked but there is no grace period on the cool downs between when the declaration expires and when you can click another from your inventory in short if you re being followed around by some twit farming rep who twelve levels higher than you and fully decked out you re boned if you just want to click ground spawns to advance the story if you re into player versus player just dilly i guess annoying if you re not
a post apocalyptic paradise fallout shelter is one of my favourite free to play games of all time i can play this game anywhere thanks to its multiple platforms on the couch in bed while in eating and anywhere else i can think of it may not be like the other fallout role playing game or shooter games where you get to roam the wasteland but instead you get to simulate overseeing your own vault of dwellers and build the greatest vault the wasteland will ever see and if you get bored after playing for thirty hours or unlocked everything in the vault with max number of dwellers and semi max special just destroy your vault and make another one that what i did after playing for a week and live been playing for one hundred and ten hours now May
possibly one of the largest most expansive games live ever played holy great googly gains this is simply massive full on battles full on wars and a simple yet diverse environment to explore with variation tot he point where it feels like a literal new planet each time you re in a fight and all for free hell yeah
early access review embodies literally everything wrong with the massively multiplayer online genre these days if you are planning to buy this just to give it a try and see if it maybe captures the feeling of adventure mos in the early a had done this is another soulless on rails grind est to the level cap you one or two shot all quest mobs and never get in danger of dying while questing so there no point in asking other people to play with you you re gonna level faster on your own anyways of course that also makes all rare gear you get from dungeons and level ups feel meaningless too everything already dying in two hits regardless what difference does it make of and then there the auto run to quest objective feature because nothing spells out adventure like literally going on rails then there the super linear main quest that every massively multiplayer online these days has to have because that what people are asking for when they say they want levelling to be more fun cut scenes dear massively multiplayer online developers please stop making questing just a chore to get to the real game at the level cap let there be some involvement let me at least have to turn my brain on let people die if they pull too many mobs if the game is harder people will want to play together and form bonds more
so here we are again out in the wilderness days gone by and your hard throbbing member has yet to be planted into some raw juicy rear you sit out in your scrawny little watch tower when suddenlybluarghthats it all you've been waiting for that one handsome and muscular call from the woods you take out your deer homo caller and let out one equally as homoerotic call hoping that it will react to it you patiently wait out those painstaking minutes which feel like hours you look through your binoculars and you see something something in the bush that int quite right its the antlers those big pointy and majestic antlers piercing through the foliage your nerves are going haywire your breathing is out of control but you manage to keep your binoculars steady as you focus on the beast it breaks through the foliage there is is muscular sweaty and musky stag just waiting to be plugged you stow your binoculars away as you approach the valiant beast every step you take towards it makes your heart beat faster and faster you can see it you can smell it you can feel it and there it is right in front of you just a stone toss away you re ready you've prepared your whole life for this your senses are going through the roof you reach into your pants unbuckle the strap whop out your throbbing and well greased gun you clear your mind slow down your breathing and take aim bang everything quiets down there you are right on top of it you stroke your hand over the fur and gently carcass the antlers after filling it up with your munition and just as you re about to pull out a mysterious man walks out of the woods and looks you straight in the eyes it has come to my attention that you've been dropping whitetail deer with a permitted ammo to hell with you doc
i just cant stop playing this game great for pros but has a lot of use for casual players too with online play that is always different due to the huge variety of playable characters gods from various pantheons
the game itself can certainly be enjoyable at times but ninety of your time will be taken up by the long and boring grind for vehicles and their modules which most require to even function properly this is only made worse by a development team that continues to completely ignore and then openly mock the player base whenever they raise legitimate concerns italian tanks were teased months ago and still we have nothing world war mode is probably never coming development on naval forces is at a minimum and air battles have seen no meaningful development in years on top of all this almost all new content is top tier tanks for the already crowded german soviet and american trees whilst the smaller british french and japanese trees get nothing the deus done care about the players or the game they just want to squeeze as much money out of you as they can before the game dies edit thanks to the recent controversies foreigner have finally started to implement one or two positive changes so there is a dim light at the end of the tunnel
for someone who never played this title it is freaking amazing when you start to learn the ropes and get into some good fights in talking full air armour vehicle and infantry combat so seamless that sometimes you will just stop and admire the crazy battle ragging in front of you to all new players do yourself a favor and watch a few kids on youtube to get some pointers to get going in the right direction promise you wont be disappointed
if you can remember one thing from me remember this you must never lose faith in yourself if you done believe you can win then you'll suffer defeat not only in duels but in real life believe me that advice is more valuable than any card you'll ever own but i wouldn't know live not collected the best cards in the game yet believe in the heart of the cards they wont mislead you you too will soon come to know fear when someone says caber angel or red eyes got originally posted by even the only cheating live witnessed was someone who was using three caber angel ritual cards in ranked who i blocked and reported for cheating to kenai doesn't that limit take effect jan eight two thousand and eighteen that what i read in the report may you reported and blocked an innocent person because you couldn't read tips incur comma date of forbidden limited list implementation is january eight two thousand and eighteen January
i love this game the story is intriguing and graphics are awesome even on a poor machine module three is about to come out and more classes are scheduled to come as well highly recommend for anyone who likes mos and forgotten realms
spooky hours was reply scoop one thousands flowers of god spoke material relay good fan and one hundred fear so cannot complain by is not asking fro mon wed ten thousand spoor bora age than a spooky is me wife psi no trail jus two spoke two tip god
early access review was about to give this a negative review because i thought it had no servers thankfully i didst write that review and decided to give this game another go i got addicted to this game after my second chance got to rank seven in a day and the servers were not at all empty it just takes a while for it to find the servers near you now as for the actual game play ill list cons and pros pros the visual graphics are great for a free to play game not a pay to win game you can purchase custom skins paint jobs for your ship and two premium ships is what you can buy the two premium ships a rent that overpowering to put that into perspective of how weak they are my free ship that i earned with credits can kill both of them in a a against me the sound effects are pretty real if ships were a thing in space id say the sounds would be pretty close you can upgrade your current ship cons only one game mode to be fair it has another game mode but no one is able to select it so i think they may be working on that other game mode no customize city with the ships other than the skins you have to buy with real money you can put your own decals on it or to create your own cam skin of the ship to make it truly yours i done want a same looking ship as other players do i want to make it truly mine finding my location and finding nearby servers take too long it needs to be fixed May
out of point personal note very easy game when a understand and game can play itself when you choice to right crusaders and builds
trying to explore the map will result in forced returns back to your base camp deus tried to compensate for this small area of exploration with poor moving mechanics moving around is slow and annoying because the character is out of shape and breathes heavily every second of moving at a walking speed there are only two speeds slow and slower shooting mechanics are just of final verdict three thousand six hundred and ten
early access review this game makes me feel like in playing the original game all over again with a new twist hell the main hub town it brings you to after the tutorial is a three dimensional replica of the first battle on it even has the same character placement if you played on battle on so long ago like i did this game is a great blast of nostalgia that made me smile i highly recommend it for anyone who played the original from the standpoint of someone who never played the original games you may find this as a miss but give it a chance before you judge it maybe even go onto the battle on sight and try the original may
bad awesome games not like i wasted sixteen hundreds hours of my goddamn useless life in it as well as money i regret nothing edit now its twenty eight fort threes hours edit two now even after loosing my will to play the game because of a scam i still hold this game very very dearly i cannot hate a game live spent three thousand and forty hours on i just cant i still regret nothing lao
early access review quite cool how they made it three dimensional i just hope to god that they wont limit ninety of the items unless you pay for a membership game play needs a lot more work if they wanna compete with other free to play mos on the market cause its very stiff
early access review pros deus listen to feedback and implement them quickly true cross platform personal computer and mobile players get to play on the same map even a potato can run the game monetization is very fair its payne wait similar to war frame updates are frequent cons the game only has around three thousand and fifty hours of content atm many vol features are still missing and can make the game frustrating at times quests done give you enough experience to move between some zones so you are forced to grind not much options for graphics settings aside from one detail slider and a checkbox for bloom and of
product received for free early access review freedom you seriously have de up the original rob craft to the hardest of hardcore live been through most of these updates since i first saw the you cast feature it when it was a new game that was the in game i remember i loved live been pretty forgiving but every update by far has made the game worse and worse you guys are just as bad as feb was when they kept changing it after we all got used to it the first time i actually said this update is in awesome was when i found out about no more arm or tiers and it could all be painted and we still had the megabits you de me over when you updated the tier system where you couldn't mix low their with high tier and caused me to delete all five of my bots you then updated again and made it so all tiers work no matter how you mixed them so you made me delete my in creations just so in two months you could say hama you they work again and then i spend my goddamn money multiple times just to help make my creations my battles easier for me and for what just so you can flush it all down the drain on me and every other in player i done know what the hell you guys are thinking but this game is not the same game it was many years ago until you res decide what the rob craft is really going to be in done trying to build and battle when you guys keep changing it to where i cant use anything and have to change everything every in time you update
game is sexist your character is female and there are no options yet on being a male would still play to hear the screaming cries of the enemies i destroy with my amazing fast fingering technique of my mouse clicking
early access review hello all this is my opinion of the game take what i say into consideration before purchasing this game week one major issues was happening not anything new to a new massively multiplayer online launch fixed pretty quick to say the least apart from other mos i have played week two was of i believe player versus player started up got to experience it and want bad but some classes were overpowered and considering this game is focused on player versus player it didst meet a lot of players expectations but player versus player is hard to balance but player versus player was the only end game there week thirty four deus kicked half if not all emissary some deserved to be kicked and some didst emissary are post to give feedback positive or negative if the development team cant communicate to emissary then why even develop a huge potential game and very profitable if it was executed right game play i thought the game play was smooth although huge first person shooter problems for a lot of people including me i felt optimization could of been better for a early access game that was mostly done just a few minor fixes here and there but that was not the case combat was of kinda felt clunky even switching stances felt clunky to me combat was a slow fast pace mix when using skills but overall pretty fun taming brilliant idea that i hate to see go to waste loved this aspect of the game you could capture anything just about in the game hope to see other mos use this idea but make it even better although id how you could make it even better hama crafting it was simple i liked that not really into life skills that much dungeons were pretty difficult after a few patches but the loot was meh even for the last dungeon this game failed because of poor communication from deus you tubers who only play to lvi twenty and so forth but i can not recommend this game in its current state i hope to see it bounce back but i highly doubt it took to big of a hit
best free to play card game live ever played and live played many its very fast paced and easy to learn plus you can make endless interesting decks if you re a fan of the elder scrolls series then you'll love all the references plus you done have to invest any money into the game and still have just as much fun as a pay to play player however unfortunately top decks use the same strategies and cards which is a huge no no for a card game especially one introducing itself to the community pros fast pace free to play players can do just as good as pay to play good early on playability cons game is unbalanced at times top meta decks usually use the same cards and strategy
early access review honestly its a fantastic game its incredibly vast and much more lifelike then its obvious cousin i have only been playing for a week so maybe my opinion will change as time goes on but i highly doubt it i am a little overwhelmed with all of the recipes and possibilities the game seems to offer but overall i am absolutely hooked the game is fun i haven run into a need to buy pro to actually play and enjoy the game although many of the reviews live read seem to state otherwise guess we will see
mobile game that got ported to personal computer the worst thing is that you'll get automatic loss if you fight against a mobile user update feb achievements are broken and it seems like the deus wont fix them anytime soon most people fixed the issue using the data transfer feature but that requires starting the game on mobile first
this game is basically hearthstone with a sky rim setting but they added lanes into the card arena just to make it very range que and to attempt to differentiate it from hearthstone as with all free to play card games you get what you pay for unless you grind for hundreds or thousands of hours the game simply int fun enough for me to bother doing that if you want a simple free game but a rent bothered about winning get this one if you re super serious about being top ranked get out your wallet
early access review ten concept game play design are wins but end result is a fail for me in general its a good game easy to learn and play the diversity is pretty extensive good selection of elements as basis with added neutral cards allows a good selection for decks and then the possibility to multi class between elements brings in the real complexity of such games most of all is the simplicity with some beautiful deco and cards effect unfortunately this said there the cons side lets start with details description of effect and such you cant put much on cards so i do like the overlay for detailed info but there a lack of precision in those said details all you can read is always the same generic message they need to look into others games to really understand this part for last what really sinks them is the vigils concept they control the level and power of the cards but also link to turns unfortunately the fact that its not guaranty that you'll find since you need to draw them as you would other cards so you have fifty cards in your deck then you add twenty five vigils makes it seventy five cards one third of those cards are vigils the outcome is the side i hate from this game you can either get min max amount of vigils if you get a min amount its game over since you cant afford higher cards in opposite if you get too many on a constant basis your level does go up but you have nothing to play or defend with this leaves you with the fair amount throughout the game which is either win or loses but after how many failed turn due to unbalance vigils distribution
okay all jokes aside this is super in cool if you want to learn how to smuggle a gun through security but cant figure out how just watch this game show you how to break that thing down to a thousand tiny lego pieces then learn how to put it back together in the dark blindfolded by playing the click everything till it works reassembly of said gun super well done super cool very very useful if you want to learn to disassemble your own gun without breaking it first with or without gun ownership a great game to own an interesting game to play is to the guy who wrote not the best game to play in airports i have pulled this game up like two dozen times in the past year since i read that i have always thought of that post as i did so funny as to this day well played
this game started to update itself and the update came with a trojan called winery tip all which was detected by my antivirus software i trust steam but this incident makes me question if this trust is maybe misplaced needless to say never winter was uninstalled and will not be installed again
one hundred and ten bugged as hell get sad aim with holding breath centrally in the guy a want to kill shoot at rock near a and a done know why die because of head shot with so go try to reclaim items after re spawn get disconnected when or connection is stable a are forced to restart the game when a finally get to the place where a diabolo follow there is no longer any items and guy who killed a go re spawn with new items get killed by sniper multiple times try to re spawn and get or items back server shutdown please try later when a finally get to the place where a diabolo follow there is no longer any items and guy who killed a be lucky and find of spawner in world secure it in global inventory go ave server to not die from fifteen snipers go to car ride to airport quit vehicle but quit it two miles away from or vehicle run immediately to place where a quit vehiclelololololol there is no longer any of spawner send support ticket about this wait for response our servers are running fine sir they haven crashed at all go drop all items in lounge uninstall a lost seventy six hours for a game which have billions of bugs and support will only tell a our server are running fine i hope this game die and i find better game with zombies best regards gupta sparta ding ding ding ding din update support team just spit me directly in face i got disconnected twice because of their servers but its not fault of their servers and if you come on aggressive to us how do you expect to be responded to laugh out loud i got angry because of stupid bug in which i lost item but i done even insult them better buy new trash can than play this game
i knew this was just a conversion from the mobile application therefore my expectations for this game should have been low it is impossible however not to feel some excitement when engaging with new material from the fallout universe and excitement walks handing and with high expectations fortunately fallout shelter has to a great extent met those expectations why this game is so simple to play which makes it perilously addictive everything can be controlled with just the mouse for instance to assign vault dwellers to specific roles you just drag and drop them to specialised rooms that a right the pun was intended your vault dwellers have the up dec i al system just like fallout and some of the rooms have a preferred up dec i al a the science lab required high intelligence for example while it in to compulsory to adhere to the assigned up dec i al doing so will make you vault dweller very happy and happiness as you will find is very important the rooms of your vault weapons and armour will be limited in the beginning but your options quickly grow with the growth of your vaults population which can be increased in two ways you can build a radio studio to attract dwellers from the wasteland or in a more novel way assign a male and female dweller to a living quarters then sit back and let the amorous spectacle commence fortunately for those sick minded individuals out there the game wont let you force incest or exile a pregnant dweller as for the graphics they are of course basic but not repulsive or retro feeling in fact the endearing vault boy cartoon style pervades the game and makes each dweller quite endearing the power armour suits though look a little compressed and a little too comical the replay value of the game is somewhat limited which of course is because fallout shelter was intended to be the launchpad for fallout four this is evident in the missions which after incorporating some witty dialogue in keeping with the fallout universe fail to vary and challenge the player the management in combat is limited the same half dozen locations become dreary and the enemies equally so in short the missions can become something to run in the background in order to gain revenue whilst being more attentive to another task in your internet browser overall this game is definitely worth playing but only if you looking for a bit of lighthearted fun the serious gaming and long term gaming remains with fallout four or for more avid fallout fans like myself fallout new vegas
early access review ont if you done want to was it your time play the original it has thirteen years of work the company artie clearly doesn't know how to run this game too good with its cross platform this game is limited so done expect too much from it again if you want to play this game and done like it go to the original and then see
this game really needs maintenance in so many ways lang low res literally min craft tank connection via wireless last player to load ingram its better to play on phone not com why the hell did i download dis there world of tanks computers blitz
tbs this game has a lot of potential it is a pretty good game different enough from min craft the graphics are very good the soundtrack is amazing the night sky is just of so magical the corruption layer is hard as it should be and its very scary as it should be the enemies are pretty nice and fun and definitely more difficult than any enemies in min craft now lets look at the bad things the recept things can get pretty annoying because you need to craft something that can be pretty expensive to get something you really need which can be pretty annoying but nothing horrible there is no goal at all yes there is some hidden story in this but that really not what you could call a goal i mean you can set yourself a goal but i mean that pretty i done want to be rude but that kinda lame other than that this game has a lot of potential and i hope the next update will bring many more things not like the steampunk update that didst bring almost anything except for people who are able to purchase things for money
so let me break it down world of guns gun disassembly is a unique game if live ever seen one you start off with a classic kalashnikov and work your way up to a colt not much of a spoiler there but yeah the game is all about unlocking things field strip your gun to unlock disassembly disassembly your gun to unlock reassembly assemble to operation operation to game game to super game and super game to hardcore game you can guess what the first three are operation is using the various features on a gun changing handgrips firing it attaching a silencer or even folding a stock the games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint on super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints you might be thinking okay that easy well live spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one price wrong or forgetting what came first a few times the game screws you over by saying you need to do this first even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you example you need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on one gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod but this particular gun needs both to be on its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it on the graphics end of it the outside of the gun looks awesome one thousand and ten texturing on the inside though many parts have brush texturing this means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black honestly they re just shaped blocks at that point a mere representative no complaint unless your obsessed with he textures on the of the guns themselves tons of variety i find quite a few guns i like in their collection however i need to sift through a lot of guns i done cary about at all just to get to them sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock but whats the fun of that well ill tell you total access unless you got a lot of time and patience you wont get through this game without paying because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one sure the points increase as you move on up but the points needed per gun almost quadruple so it makes playing fairly hard to do also you cannot earn any points through the ranges i do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using a lot plus its just challenges and not free shooting you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish the graphics for the range also take a plunk going to counter strike sixteen issue graphics aka crappy world textures and okay gun textures there is also another few ways to unlock points two of them broken for me reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me first is coming back every day done laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row even if you only pop in the grab that bonus but make sure you come back every day or it will reset next method is by joining the group and inviting friends i managed to join the group but now it wont let me invite friends because the button for it does not function i have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work but this gives you some credits and a ton of experience points to use on unlocking guns but i cant use it because its broken last method is the quiz which has a high failure rate for me figures sizes test your ability to recognize the gun models the more you get right is the more experience points you get to walk away with get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for two hours the funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points it will however even though i got all the questions right lock me out for two hours its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz but yet i get none of my earned points it only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz if not it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button craziest thing is if i fail the quiz it doesn't crash at all i feel like they re trying to keep me from getting points cheek bastards anyways in reinstalling still voting positive for this game even though its got a bunch of cheek breeks coders
early access review do i recommend this game hell yes i have spent a good deal of the past few months on this game and i can tell you that by achieving one thousands hours of game play very recently that this game is not the kind of indie you expect the deus are always checking up on forums responding to concerns and helping in every way they possibly can to a several thousand person player base with fifteen deus running the place they've gone to exceedingly long lengths to make this game balanced and if any player out there gets into this game early know this all that fun you re having in the low tiers yeah it only gets better from there a i honestly am extremely proud to say that my favourite game of all time has won indie of the year and i cannot say it enough thank you to all the people that make this game fun re is love re is life
early access review amazing game i have never ran into a game like this team fortress two i really love the way everything stands out and has its own fun style in the world its like min craft but ninety nine better people could disagree but i wont in just saying if you try this game you will have fun and done get stressed out if you cut do or find something because the world is huge thank you for making this game it is an awesome game that i think will get into the famous route
early access review in currently on room one hundred and fifty and i feel like i can now give this game a recommendation this is a very basic premise that could almost be satire since it starts off with cardboard cutouts but the art design is great its quite sky it doesn't cost you anything and it only took me four minutes to download so i cant complain
this game applies to a very niche market and if you a rent prepared to pay you probably wont enjoy it that being said i think its a great game and its highly rewarding when you get kills the community is very active and you can play competitions daily as long as you are prepared to pay you'll probably enjoy it
this game is not worth the headache i got muted for saying that i was eating nacho chips and that is not the only time never winter muted me every week for nothing it feels like some kids is just clicking report on everyone and never winter must use a computer that just mutes you when ever you get any report on yourself i was a paying customer of never winter i put my own hard earned money into the game and i got banned for reasons that are completely unreasonable the game is so repetitive after level seventy that well it leaves you wondering why why do i even play this game never winter does not work on game bugs and the graphics are way outdated no wonder its a ftp pts type of game it leaves you so bored after a week cause that who long to takes to get max level
done get me wrong this game has a lot of good points but has one major flaws will start with the big flaw this game is is free to play and doesn't have a via level caps or premium areas its ridiculously expensive if you want to make any real progress ill give a few examples there are free mounts in the game which can be bought with in game gold these are very plain and basic mounts the best mounts in the game cost twenty five hundreds three thousand five hundred zen this translates to twenty five twenty five for a horse skin and faster movement speed which i can buy a whole game for you can earn astral diamonds can be converted zen six times a day so there is a way to earn the items well say you might make twenty thousand astral diamonds in a day which i personally want anywhere near doing but one zen three hundred and eighty and so to buy that horse zen you re going to need one million three hundred and thirty thousand astral diamonds which is sixty six days of play which is stupid downloadable content is ridiculously expensive considering its just items gear and mount high level items all require astral diamonds or zen the in game money is pretty much useless and can only buy health potions and kits to unlock the treasure chest at the end of that dungeon you just did not regular quests requires you to buy a key with astral diamonds game is too simple you get three abilities two passives two big abilities and a class specific sort of mode these can be swapped out with other skills that you unlock but heck give me some variety game was never really that challenging in sure it gets more difficult but i got to level fort three with very little difficult game looks alright for a massively multiplayer online role playing game very few look amazing game is very poorly optimized in running a titan a go of ram six core with hyper threading and all over clocked on a a screen pitcher three which is an absolutely stunning game graphically and rubs this game in the dirt always had forty fps in some areas this game makes me hit twenty first person shooter which is abysmal quests are quite repetitive guess ill get to some positives then no areas and mobs are diverse boss fights are pretty cool good to just pass some time if you've got nothing to play game has a lot to do by the looks of it and if you've got hundred of pounds to waste then heck go ahead very clear dungeons and dragons elements though you cant use the majority of your abilities there quite a lot to choose from if the developers want to improve this game make your zen exchanges rates better with real world currency make the regular currency able to buy more things literally everything should be purchasable with coppers even if you have to balance it by making it quite a lotto many sub currencies in the games a a seals astral diamonds zen coppers things like loot shouldn't come at a cost to just open
brawl all is the greatest game ever made its that simple using items in competitive play may seem like this game is for filthy casuals but actually this game is for intellectuals like myself that enjoy masterfully crafted games rivals more like brawl all that game in two herd so i a play dis gem now a the one thousand one hundred and ten May
the best way to describe this game is by using a quote from leavis and butt head leavis its called money us he its called meh money money and chicks yeah bulkhead thu huh that would be cool davis yeah yeah its like first the teacher gives us like some money and then we get to go score with all these chicks yeah member its pretty cool you should sign butt head huh leavis leavis and then after we score with the chicks we get more money and then like and then like more chicks cause we have more money and then we get more more more and then butt head slaps him money and chicks for twenty fifteen game of the year
is scary wouldn't want to get too attached to this smash like game i do think its quite different to smash especially in balance because this game has cause so many frustrations time to talk about the community not spammers skilled spammers regular spammers cocky eleven year old talking eight year old people that will ruin others games because their game was ruined the community is so toxic and that it makes everyone else toxic if you were to play this game play it on playstation four the best console the community is still quite new there so people haven really found out how to ruin your day everyone in gold lat who think they re good in the trashcan
i used to enjoy playing this game back in the earlier beta stages since then i have grown to dislike the game fractured space went from a free to play game to a pay to win game players used to have a level playing field in terms of ships but now a player can buy implants to make their crew overpowered implants can be earned through months or years of grinding for supply drops or by buying currency and getting the ones one needs it is truly disappointing to see this game turn to the dark side of free to play games because i really liked playing this game i would pay sixty to buy this game but i will not feed a pay to win scandal in addition to the above problem getting credits in game is incredibly grind a player may get fifteen thousand credits from a match but it takes upwards form three hundred thousand to buy a ship combine that with the five minute que time and the player is looking at a wasted day i personally have had one last issue with this game i do not know if this happen to any other players but i had all my ships reset a long time ago shortly after they added the black widow i believe i had owned all of the ships currently in the game and then i had to grind all the credits to buy new ones it was disappointing to say the least May
really tried to like it but has technical issues at least on my personal computer am wings not a massively multiplayer online is an online multiplayer tanka plane capture the flag war game you have a limited number of re spawns in the same match some maps has air tanks units i didst found a proper way to organize battles for people who does not have team speak is a free for all it runs smooth when it does not freeze nice models and sounds for a free game is of
early access review this game has a lot of potential what started as an april fools joke expanded to a amazing battle royal game but the hollows from the halloween update just remove them April
a great game for people that like to shoot zombies it really gives you the walking dead day hype feeling also great fro first person shooter rookies and the team play is really intense and it gives you the creeps at night while running through a forrest with zombies behind you overall score my opinion a seven hundred and ten keep up the good work folks
i think the game is great but its a little annoying that you have to be a member to enjoy the game if you re not a member your play options is limited it would be great if they made some more options for free users i would recommend the game if there were more options but right now i done
early access review very much enjoy playing this game its fun competitive and intense yet still in alpha i personally believe that this could be a great game i love how it takes some components from paladins champions of the realm and able to transform it into something new i recommended playing paladins first because you will gain an advantage over other players however there are a large amount of bugs needed to be fixed
its pay to win the grinding for free players is absolutely awful there multiple free tanks that are severely underpowered until you upgrade them thing that will take hundreds of games of grinding there paid tanks that not only are a lot better than free tanks but also stand out from the rest in a negative way with ridiculous models and decorations
early access review healthy item mall with only cosmetics locked behind paid currency free to play shooter with typical free to play shooter content bad players that look like they play with no sound good players with limbo like precision jumpers and crouches fingers to go to your servers we done need is here it center it center side note add more maps to demo pool to would learn spanish lang again
early access review my initial thought of the game for the first fifty rooms was that the game was not very scary at all that all changed as soon as i opened the next door because i met the first monster who scared the out of me nine hundred and ten
grind grind grind its just about grinding you have to play a lot to get powerful other than that everything is on sale you done have a knife or secondary gun your gun doesn't have sight you have to pay seventy five thousand for times scope sight if you wanna know how much is this the us a sub aching price is fifty thousand still cheaper than the scope i got bored that everything needs buying even your ammunition
he pretty good nothing original all in liars this game admit idly is not for casuals there is the door now onto the review this game is pretty much the best first person shooter ever as long as there will be people to play it combining massively multiplayer online and first person shooter with satisfying strategy elements the compromise with free to play is there is pay to play options but you are never required to drop even a penny join a squad re some boobs and boom enough cash to buy a decent sniper all in all the most important thing to remember is this game ages like a fine wine to any experienced gamer especially when you get god with the vehicles
great franchise ruined by free to play cup five for a track really sim in or race seven graphics is better but that want hard to achieve after five years race seven or everything else i wont write why free to play model sucks no there are other things which completely ruin experience too menu design is super ugly terrible broken and confusing big wheel design is super idiotic console thing what this a it is doing in pure personal computer game is beyond reason its one of the worst menu designs i ever saw and my eyes are hurt every time i have to navigate in menu because of terrible font rendering and then game doesn't see my game pad really it works perfectly fine in race seven controller setup is poorer from seven too i cant drive properly because of lack of many options from game has always online dry not recommended updated tried it first time after february because of sale game pad now works still super ugly and confusing menus auto shifting is broken it goes up auto but you have to manually shift down still only time trials update ii fifth july twenty fourteen sound is the best among racing simulations its just outstanding they introduced competitions which is great way to experience content you done own and if you are excellent driver you can win various things kudos for that i installed game again because there is fifty summer sale and sim in sent month ago some free rps i got eight hundred mostly for people who done play it anymore now some bad things you need to drive perfectly in time trials you read it right even if you slightly hit off road and i mean you didst cut curve your lap time is invalid a a a no solution drive as amateur in leader board challenge then its like old race and then there is a bug reported by others which put my personal computer into hibernation and then just restart it whf February
do not buy there is no controller support even this they claim there is cant remap any keys to do anything i can turn left and that it i can sit there turning left cant move nothing took four days to even be able to load the game
be wiz should have announce this game as free to play from the beginning to avoid confusion they have given people the false impression that this game is only buy to play i am sure if they stated this earlier people would not be as angry not to mentioned the other problems which people have been talked about i do enjoy the game play even with all the problems but one only problem is i feel being cheated by new as they turn the game into free to play which i would have not are purchase if they well inform us that this game is going to be free to play of well i quilted this game best of lucks and lastly i do really feel bad the people who are on the same boat as me take care guys
this is a game that requires you to smite stuff in the face over and over lots of smiting in smite smite this face and you smite that face you smite here and you smite there its smite
i began the game and i started to wander around because i had no idea what to do but after ten minutes of the slowest walking ever then i found some tracks i started following them and after twenty minutes i found a mound of deer poop and the kept following the tracks then i stumbled upon a pheasant the first live creature i had seen in the game i aimed in my rifle after scouring the controls on how to equip my gun and pulled the trigger nothing came out a notification that i done have the correct license to hunt that type of animal and that if i wanted to become a member to check the store so i walked around for another twenty minutes i ended up making a circle of the whole map and ended up at the lodge where i began then i quit the game that explains the time i have in it after looking at the store i came to notice that this game is pay to win and then i uninstalled it i wouldn't recommend this game unless it was bill gates because he could afford to buy all of the crap that in any other game you would purchase with in game money
while this game is an innovative first person experience with great graphical effects realistic characters and one of the best plots live seen in games so far i do have some points of critic one the storytelling is pretty linear and sometimes makes you feel like your in game choices done matter two the bosses are way to hard to beat while mapping
lovely game its an amazing game technically outstanding showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail especially in the all important multiplayer aspects the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying it took me a long time to warm up to but in helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends if you can spare the time play it
early access review with the last patch the royal game become a casual game all the best weapons are spawned randomly so you can be a best player but two hundred hits damage is eight hundred hits you cant do nothing
well foreigner net agent removed war thunder due to unwanted unasked and unneeded software being installed without my permission and the ability to remove it being obfuscated it looks like one these a spyware sending data even when updates not needed this stay on your personal computer even when game uninstalled i will suggest everybody to remove it what is quite problematic
this review is for those who are already familiar with mobs and have played data two or league of legends i will point out what makes smite unique compared to those games third person camera perspective unlike the classics smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character this allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability almost every ability in the game has to be aimed including melee and ranged basic attacks that right if you want to play the and carry in smite prepare yourself to be completely useless if you cant land your basic attacks same goes for everything else if you cant hit your abilities reliably you will not succeed there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed from the other perspective this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations many times i was one hit away from death but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements i survived playable characters heroes champions in smite are real gods from pantheons that were once and some still are worshipped norse roman mayan hindu chinese greek play as zeus thor odin loki and many other gods and mythical creatures hire studios does a mostly great job at interpret ting these well known deities into detailed playable characters and for those deities you done know there is always a lore section for every god so you even learn something about different cultures while you play may knowledge five different game modes one that changes every day unlike its competitors smite features many different game modes aside from the classical is here called conquest arena is no lanes team deathwatch siege is two lanes small jungle joust is one lane small jungle assault is all random all mid one lane the mode of the day changes every day and features fun setups like is on the assault map and everyone gets the same god all of these game modes have their own detailed and well crafted map in conquest mount olympus opposes a volcano in arena you fight in a grand coliseum in assault you defend the halls of asgard from the forces of chaos in siege you fight for supremacy in the lush mayan rain forests and in joust you re a knight for some reason it will be changed to a chinese themed map soon in addition to that smite features one of the best deals in a free to play game the god pack the god pack costs thirty and contains every god currently in the game owners of the god pack also receive the newest god as soon as they re released forever that means the more gods join the battle of smite the more value you get for your thirty you do the match why should you play smite over league or data if you love mythology and you like the concept of mobs but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones smite will be the game for you its highly skill based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional mobs do not have i played league of legends for four years but after i got arthritis this is a joke from playing add and kiting for too long i gave up for me smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that i can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional mobs never did i will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about smite i am not delusional many skins in smite are locked behind chests which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want it can be infuriating when a cool new skin for your favourite god is announced only to later find out its in a chest with fifty six other items hire abuses this a bit too much though we have the god pack so that balances it out eur servers can be very unreliable quality control at hire is either nonexistent or very bad some new gods release in a pitiful state either balance or design wise they have horrid animations amateur like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered some god designs are also very questionable sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their lore or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense did you know the spartans put the statues of ares the god of war in chains to restrain him yeah that cool but only a small footnote in his lore well what hire did was base his whole in game design on that little fact he shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate arm or with broadsword and shield the shield has a demonic visage on it where the fire comes out does that sound like the greek god of war to you not to me but these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience live been playing this game for more than a year and only looking forward its free in the end so why not try it out and look for yourself
if you can get passed the micro transactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately then there is tons of content and game play time you can get out of this it is not pay to play every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and its really fun once you start to get the hang of the game pros can be played in a massive group or solo several to farm for per class large community for help a steady learning curve you will get better a pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths you shouldn't have many unfair deaths that make you rage quit con spam bots have to pay to unlock more character slots ant been many major updates for a very long time this game just int for everyone but its free and definitely worth trying out in not that into games with third person view but i have hundreds of hours of this game on the room website
live tried this game a few times but its always been awkward and clunky as if weird mechanics have been kept to make it feel nostalgic and how it used to be and if you done have a large screen the had just feels way too large combined with a mediocre community and a lot of anger and complexity its only really good for hardcore mob fans newcomers should play literally any other mob
early access review cool looking game ill try it of of in restricted to one class until i get enough experience points or i could pay to become a sniper spent many hours grinding my experience points so i could become a sniper finally became sniper of what i have to buy that sniper rifle that dumb i better start grinding or i could just pay real money finally earned enough to purchase sniper rifle whf i need to grind for money to buy ammo for the sniper rifle or i could paying for it with real money this game is a huge money sink nobody wins not even those who pay to win even people who want to play as a tank driver or pilot have to keep paying for new tanks and planes
early access review currently the game has a lot of large glaring issues with it i am not talking about server stability or queue times as that is the norm for an massively multiplayer online launch there are a lot of issues in the game still in the basic areas like optimization combat feeling disjointed and overall feeling of clunk ness with the game as a whole i understand they added the combo combat system to the game to appeal more to the market but currently it feels very wrong action combat was a feature when advertised to the nae market and currently only one class has the action combat crosshair in game and admittedly the deus removed it from all the other classes i think this game has a lot of potential and it being an older game with some reworks makes it even more it seems like they truly wanted to revise and reinvigorate the game however currently it just falls flat i hope the deus can do something to make this game really shine but there is a lot of negative information about them circulating around right now so its a grey area i cannot recommend this game simply because promised features that were shown and used previously are completely absent without any notification from the development team i have hope albeit very little that they can make this into something great
nice specimen of incremental games with lots of builds to try and not pay town at all however it definitely need more steam achievements in my opinion most trophies except easiest ones should have steam achievement linked to it
i may not have a whole lot of experience with this game but from what i played it just feels like a clunker version of hearthstone if you re looking for a game like hearthstone with a unique twist try pvt heroes out instead of this May
early access review this was my new favourite game to play on steam heavy emphasis on was id why the deus had to go and screw this game up by putting women in it until it goes back to how it was uninstalling
fallout shelter is a free to play simulation game styled in the fallout series world the game tasks the player with building and managing their own vault fallout shelter and dealing with collecting resources as well as invading enemies you take the role of overseer the leader and coordinator of the vault your job is to make the inhabitants happy through meeting their needs power food water as well as tasking them to work in the correct areas dwellers inhabitants produce resources for their respective jobs at a different rate dependent on their special strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility luck most of the game revolves around this concept of balancing resources pros fun game play until you hit a certain point free to play visual style is enticing and fun to look at items and pcs from the fallout series are in the game cons lack of depth ends up being very repetitive unnecessary amount of micro transactions lack of end game content cdr simulator based in the fallout series world game play gets repetitive and lacks any end game content or a goal fun for a while but loses interest fairly quickly is on a side note the games files are stored client side meaning you can edit your saves and adjust the times on your computer to affect your vault
early access review played for a bit game was so i uninstalled couple of hours later the in war thunder launcher appears on my screen and starts downloading war thunder turns out it also installed a completely different process that you have to delete manually nice
early access review an overused concept with some welcome additions to that base formula that allow for an intriguing if not all too familiar experience the actual game itself is littered with bugs which is to be expected with the nature of alpha builds all in all the experience is enjoyable but still nothing special although the recently increased and already very rapid and active development that is based off of the feedback from the community is a welcome change of pace from a competitive shooter that is not seen elsewhere and leads to hope for the future of this game as a whole overall i would give the game a six thousand five hundred and ten in its current state
early access review a fun alternative to pubgfortnitehzpros free character customization with sliders decent graphics runs smoothly expressly when compared to pub decent gunplay expressly when compared to pub better equipment management the game automatically equips modifications has easy scope switching and is relatively quick to gear up in travel perks gliding skiing climbing nice car physics ability to spot mark cons map in indonesia thai version was superior too large of a map means more spread out battles still faster paced than pub a bit awkward but not as clunky as pub or he cant jump when snowboarding the competitiveness of the game is watered down by the fact a helicopter allows up to four players to win so there is no last man standing showdown when compared to available battle royal games this one would probably be my top pick until blackout releases
early access review started out rough but they re churning out patches really frequently and it seems like they genuinely care about the community feedback i wouldn't recommend it now unless you want to be there during the optimization process but six months down the line thill be a great massively multiplayer online if they keep the ball rolling
early access reviewed it so the game gets launched finally no more its still in beta forgive them they are experimenting anti hines when i started the grind want terrible when i started the game play want terrible when i started the ping was terrible but i had no problem with that now the grind is unbearable squad twenty forces you into a prefixed squad and cant change classes unless you made a personalized one and are playing on it which its more grind a and if by any chance you play in latin america have my steam in english though then by reno all latin america speaks brazilian old review until reno destroys and push out of the window the infamous squad twenty system
lots of potential but a real disappointment the real time strategy side of the game was its point of difference over similar games like day of defeat or red orchestra rising sun however the developers have neglected this side of their game and focused on game mechanics that milk players of every last drop of cash milk i have around eight hundred hours played you used to be able to run the game in a browser without using steam and have come back to the game several times the game used to have flaws but was fun the biggest changes i noticed when i came back to look at the game most recently was that the grind has become huge and that the matches i played were not fun prices for all equipment items require hours of grinding this grinding is not fun i doubt i will be coming back to play again even though i have most of the top end equipment over thirty soldiers spread over three factions and a full array of generals and ats assault teams on them it is just not fun to play any more
early access review done write reviews at all but for bless online i wanted to take the time and do that i bought the game and i was hyped about it i understand that in early access things can go south but for this one things really way south i no longer have a desire to play this game for numerous of reasons that were mentioned in previous reviews the game is great but the management is very poor not to mention that most of the players quit playing this game
i differ from most reviewers that live read my gripes a rent against the cynical pay to win design or anything like that i utterly loathe the art and the game mechanics people say this game looks pretty i i am truly flabbergasted by that as i think it is the ugliest most generic looking piece of garbage and the game mechanics are superficial and in no way interesting id stay away from this game a long long way away
this is one of the best games ever made and when played on hardcore it is one of the most difficult challenging and rewarding games of the modern era a triumph over most games of this generation and a callback to times when every player had to learn the game they were playing in order to succeed rather than being catered to and handheld except this time you have an interactive community to help you along the way as the game features trading partying player housing and an interesting global chat and what a journey it will be the atmosphere of this game feels like a blend of dark souls meets diabolo despite the graphics being pretty simple there a ton of heart and fantastic art direction flavour paving every step of the way there literally thousands upon thousands of ways to build your character despite this ninety of the community just plays co builds hyperbole the best part the game is free aside from some purely aesthetic micro transactions which look very nice no pay to win here until you need more stash tabs i a storage space the community is one of the most diverse for better for worse communities live ever encountered and the depth of this game is greater than most morphs despite this genre being an online arg the difficulty scales to an absurd extent you can never truly face roll every aspect of this game unless you play co in which case please uninstall your not a good player stop uploading twinned boss map clear videos to geddit nobody care except for other co players and there just so much depth and repayable value to this game that i really cant recommend it enough the endgame on hardcore is insanely fun and often times heart racing with immense risk and reward being omnipresent throughout the experience the more you play this game the more you want to play it and that is a surefire sign of both an addictive problem and a masterpiece on the negative side of things the early portion of this game is a total intuitive massif you re unfamiliar with the arg genre or even if you re somewhat familiar with it the game will likely feel far too overwhelming to bother with it doesn't even bother trying to tutorial be you and while the exploratory independence the game gives you is ultimately empowering its a little too vacuous for genuinely new players several of the games mechanics character features are amazingly in depth and custom table once you begin to grasp them but unfortunately they also come off as very hard to understand initially and even once you begin to understand them you'll likely fail to fully realize what you can do with them for quite some time none of this is necessarily bad but it could certainly be of putting to a large demographic the pace of the game is also painfully slow early on this is especially true if you have no gear and if you re new to the game most new players and even several veteran players done know how to level efficiently and waste a lot of excess time doing certain pointless side quests picking up every useless item killing every mob doing irrelevant side areas it center bluntly put combat will not feel satisfying for a while but when your build starts to come together and the enemies start to possess actually significant mechanics boy of boy does the world ever turn upside down on top of that the true game doesn't kick off until merciless difficulty by which point you'll already have beaten the campaign twice and this is presently very intuitive to newer players so a significant portion of the player base ends up beating the game in their eyes on normal and then never returning even though the real experience hast even begun yet although regardless at least these people get to experience the boss fight malachi which is something you'll probably not soon forget however id still implore anyone who might turn away from the game because of these reasons to just trudge through it because come merciless difficulty come maps it will all prove to be deeply worth it once you get your first good unique item once you five link or six link your first item it center it center you'll have nowhere to go but up that is until your character dies and you angrily uninstall or re roll a co build screw co builds they re killing the game and trivializing the content alright egg you caught me this was all really an elaborate ruse with the actual intent of this review being nothing more than a rant about co builds co builds are utterly face roll and negate all strategic thought difficulty mechanics and build variety involved in this game also nerf lightning coil and blade vortex got
i can see myself spending a lot of hours on this one in a sucker for games like these i done have that many hours yet so in unsure of how much fun its gonna be in the endgame and if they still are working on the game with updates and such every time i find a game like this it dies a few months later with no new content for now tho in having fun i like that you get a lot of chests from the different campaigns and the free five hour chest also nice that you can buy cards for in game gold i also am a big fan of the fact you done have to sit around and wait for energy to do stuff like in similar games
early access review game is amazing better then all other battle royal games the graphics are amazing but still relative easy to run love that its only world war two gun i do recommend adding anti take rifles the small amount of players in a battle make the game more fun as a done run into people every ten seconds i highly recommend this game
this will be my first review i have ever done and it is because this game deserves it i loved hearthstone when it first came out but i feel it was very cookie cutter this game is much better much more strategic and a lot more fun definitely give it a try its free
product received for free early access review look at the pictures on this page full of lies art bots continuous stream of nan beams megabits why are free am doing this for money who would pay them if everyone hates them also if you like tank get a mech if you like going fast well get a mech and put some rotors on it if you like to be as agile as a bunny get a mech its even more agile than a bunny see the first promotional images mech mech more techs and techs but what if you want to fly instead if you like tank get a drone because it can flee with only five of the health bar remaining if you like going fast get a drone if you like to be agile you know the answer the funny thing is even though the deus love drones there not a single one to be found on the promotional images maybe they know that its cancerous but they done want it to go
immerse yourself in a retro post apocalyptic world while experiencing state of the art modern advertising this is a beautiful game with ugly psychology this game is beautiful artistically and has great immersion even on personal computer for someone familiar with fallout its great to see an entire game designed in the style of vault boy end positive discussion here reward in rushing is the message that is routinely reinforced as you play rushing a room is a core game mechanic and something of a miniature gamble that you engage in to make progress you rush to get resources rush rush rush rushing brings rewards that is what the game tells you rush reward rush reward you must rush to get rewards that is what makes fallout shelters pay delay scheme so lucrative the game conditions you to rush then frustrates you with delays the way to move forward is to pay for nuke cola speedups remember please that according to fallout lore vaults were social experiments done on stupid people for this game remove vault tech and replace it with bethesda this is a game that plays you in a patient player i haven spent a cent i know the game behind the game so i laugh at the things mentioned above i also enjoy the limit like challenge of balancing the little economy i send my guy out on a twenty four hour mission and come back later but this game does indeed treat you like a rat in a skinner box its missions could be played by a foraging rat no joke i down vote this exceptional game because the over aggressive and psychologically exploitive system is not something i will encourage yes i will continue to play the game i find the real challenge is beating the game company itself in the payt play game when you play this game remember vault one hundred and fourteen interview eighty seven interviewer this is vault tech interview eighty seven for the position of overseer for vault one hundred and fourteen the candidate has refused to give his real name and has only provided the name soup can harry soup can harry that right i int telling you nothing my name is the name i call myself not the rank and number the government brands on me no sir interviewer fascinating mister us soupcon would you mind telling me why you re distrustful of bethesda soup can harry live seen what they do gum up the works with red tape and bureaucracy take every hard earned cent and use it to fund their illuminati free mason sex parties in a free man i should be able to live as i see fit my taxes pay for them streets and alleys and dumpsters ill sleep where i want interviewer sir according to this you haven paid taxes in many years soup can harry i seen the back of them bravo boxes not for consumption done you tell me what to do ill eat what i want interviewer sir you may just be the perfect candidate how would you like to be the new overseer for vault one hundred and fourteen soup can harry i int wearing no damn tie or pants may
after one hours finally download it suck game yeah you wanna me register an account yeah you got it but cap cha want come up my insight and always reminds me you fit into wrong cap cha damn i did see any cap cha at all
god game player versus player cheaters get dealt with i know from experience bothers done get any problems i know with experience also the most popular bot for this can be cracked easily since they just use auto text to compile it alone thing they should do is actually make a desktop client like i done want to play a mobile game on personal computer of and you can have two steam accounts linked to the same duel links account a a i can bot on my duel links account but on another steam whilst playing counter strike global offensive on this steam
well i done really know if its bad or not now the game it self is great crisp vibrant graphics it runs great has great detail has amazing potential it is great but the docs of the docs so in a teen that likes military history i really like all things related world war two vietnam and present day i really am fascinated in tanks aircraft and ships now i own asp and like making passenger planes but sometimes its fun flying a jet with real physics but i wish i didst have to spend freaking seventy so i can fly a plane over a beach now i know you have to make funds some how to keep the game going i get it my favourite military jet is probably the a people say its ugly with its stubby nose and is weird jets blah blah blah well i think its a magnificent sight who doesn't want a plane build around the gun but alas because of the ridiculous amount of money for one plane for a game i cant fly my dream bird do i want to drive a tank yes but i cant do i want to play out normandy yes but i cant do i want to fly a a yes but i cant in thirteen living in a small town so there is almost no way for me to do something like mowing lawns because some ones already doing that type of thing i cant get a job and i like to save my money instead of use it for a plane on a game i think the game is great but eagle and fighter really got to get there docs strait because if the ridiculous pricing i cant buy any thing making the game real bearing real quick making me think of the game as just good instead of fantastic i know they need money but seven thousand and eighty for a beach and some planes and tanks is just stupid i done mean to be rude but i could buy something that could last a life time were this could be wiped by something wrong with the game computer it center be really nice if they could put the stuff at a lower price and make stuff like the a and the joint forces pack i done know free it a great game but its hard to like it if there is really nothing to do which is sometimes the case
world of tanks world of warplanes battlefield command and conquer renegade all in on hard to learn hard to master a truly awesome game and one of its kind the only mops out there
horribly unbalanced grind is horrible starting to become more and more pay to win as the years go on horrible community deus refuse to acknowledge the problems in the game and just blatantly unbalanced in terms of tanks and arm or the game play is fantastic it is much better than wot and has a lot of variety the game looks great and the tank and air game play is fun and challenging if you can put up with all of the other stuff then the game is for you if you re like me and actually like to win a game once in a while while playing your favourite tanks in the american line then this game is not for you
smite is my jam although too bad folks done have manners through the inter webs foul language and poor sportsmanship you re just foul smite fans however the game is worth it support hire
this game is so bad that i would literary drive all the way to the store buy the real game then drive to my friend to play monopoly with him girl weather than playing this game it is rigged as hell and so bad that the rolling cubes are in pattern that repeats it self and the chance card are mostly bad do not play this game ban the developers
played probably over two thousands hours of war thunder on my playstation four and my steam account foreigner really only cares about money bags and made the game a lot more recently cant recommend this game anymore
product received for free love this game but in very annoyed i start the game and its cut off on both ends also i cant go to the games settings at all to try and fix resolution for it i tried the launch method for windowed and resolution and would not work what is up with this
ever since the latest update the game has been the loading times are longer the refresh rate of the screen is slower and most of the time the game doesn't even know what to do plus the servers keep on crashing one small thing that bothers me so much is the fact that we cant even test drive the cars anymore how am i supposed to try out a car before buying it if i done even know how its going to feel
at first when i saw this game i saw a min craft ripoff as it stands min craft is losing its thrill and so have all the games like it but when i played this it was like a whole new world but with blocks it has a lot to do and is a lot of fun to play when i feel like relaxing and playing my laptop i recommend you give this a try and not assume like i did when i first saw this game
very crappy matchmaking opponents too overpowered bad graphics no first person view long loading screens a polite and awful rude teammates that call you in many bad names even my grandmas toaster has a better frame rate and it also makes you crunchy bread heroes are called just like porn stars for example queen of pain crystal maiden bounty hunter silencer witch doctor or just sounds a little bit too homosexual lone druid razor bat rider natures prophet beast master and tiny last but not least is magnum this hero does not only wield a name that destined for a huge but his horn also looks like one too sadly heroes appearance is also poor keep looks like a rabbit that smokes weed before every round to is just a light bulb kuna is the hitachi rishi a from teen morph ling is just water i think sven and juggernaut are twins storm spirit looks like an average asian man only he loves drinking energy drinks and watching tentacle porn too often natures prophet cannot even smell flowers because he has no possession of a nose ogre magi has the nicest whether beat even cuties like miranda and wind anger faceless void lets just call him eyeless dickhead all females look lets just say pretty bankable and add magnum name says it all lastly id like to say that all maps are identical which makes game boring after a while and games ending is too predictable all items that i buy always disappear starting the next round and i hate when games done have easter eggs or other skins for characters if you have read this until the end listen to me listen to the voice of reason turn off the computer go outside and discover all the things the world can give to you if you done well welcome to the data nation
used to be a good fun game to play either by yourself or with friends but then greed greed ruins everything so when i last played this game it was a fun as heck free to play wii do fighter game with an excellent matchmaking system was not pay to win and was well optimized with great graphics but then i heard what they did to the game and died a little they revamped the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of tears that are sorted by your level skill and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength this lead to said powerful planes witch consists of paid planes too to leak into the less powerful planes matches and causing the less powerful planes to not have a present experience after hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review i am not happy this game used to be great but then they ruined it old i would not give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system if they fix the system
early access review the game has some issues when it has a glitch that prevents hyperspace when the game starts and requires a rejoin as well as some ping issues when other game pings run better than others possibly lack of many servers but besides that it runs smoothly even if its at a low first person shooter you can see everything going on and the graphics are amazing as well as attention to detail one thing i look forward to seeing in this game is more ship damage like an ability to ram a ship in a weak point and tearing it in two i look forward to continuing to support and play the game and its potential for the future
i own more hats and cosmetic items in this game than i own clothes in real life after two thousand hours spent blowing people up setting people on fire beating people to death with my bare fists pushing a large explosive device in a mining cart along a track trading hats for pieces of metal and being riddled with bullets by a heat seeking automatic turret i think its safe to say team fortress two is a pretty fun game never gets old fun to team up or even duel your friends and there always more content around the corner free play it will give you a good laugh at times and other times make you want to throw your monitor out the window in blind crimson rage
early access review have to agree with everyone great game so far it is an alpha and it can be unstable it crashed twice in an hour of play and there a rent many upgrades or customizations to ships but its a lot of fun i remember another reviewer saying its unbalanced i actually disagree each category of ship has a very distinct feel and great strategic potential the problem is that most people playing this game right now are just like you intrigued gamers just trying it out a bit because of this no ones coordinating and no ones really trying to win you also cant currently change ship types in game so if the other team is full of assassins and snipers and your team is made of nothing but flagships you re going to get your butt handed to you but if you happen to get on a balanced team its pretty fun get it try it out love it anticipate the future
holy other goodness gracious slapped on a goat this is good of course there are a few bad parts which i shall start off with the shadow arena portals should be a bit more common it took me fifteen minutes at the least to reach the user and i have yet to find on the enemies and dungeons should be more varied with better traps and different attacks for instance or maybe a levelling system for the enemies varying in levels so you can farm from the smallest to the largest bosses need to be varied and more stronger as well now onto the great part the game runs smoothly most of the time the quests in the top right teach how to do most things the free random loot you can get is great the fact you can make your weapon look like a different one and keep the good stats is amazing i haven seen any other game do this my friends can teleport to me music ear candy
the best hat simulator to date this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearable in a variety of styles and colours with the ability to trade purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack you can finally feel comfortable knowing that you've wasted your life and once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items you can show them off to other pathetic losers in game you can also express your poor creativity by naming describing and painting your items with a large array of bland depressing colours become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make minuscule profit off of hour long trades of and you can also shoot stuff a must buy for all basement dwellers and fat losers one thousand and ten
early access review hey free am in sure you guys got money earned from rob craft right and it cant be only a little amount right and rob craft is a good game everyone hope believe that right then plus fix the in trash server and you will see the comments and make improvement right
early access review love this game especially since they made it less of a grind it still takes a long time i unlock new guns and yes i do consider this a pay to win game but its the good kind of pay to win game if the other guy bought a my you could still easily beat him with your starter weapon if you are better than him really the only problem i have with the game is with the overpowered my carbine you do not need any skill to use this it has the fastest fire rate no recoil its accurate and a four shot kill i can easily spray enemies down with this gun from two hundred meter away even if they have longer ranged guns
this a must play and its for free i have played the the other never winters the classic action role playing game so vague you end up wandering in over powering lands this game was made so you could go go go it takes away from the openness a bit but this gives you a fun start helps you to come back for more once it real gets tuff
i think the development did some research on objects that can scare humans you may not like the style of the graphics but this game is the creepiest horror game i have ever played all of the sound effects can scare you especially the cardboard in different level different monsters will chase you which makes the game more and more creepy therefore ignore the style of graphics and download the game i am sure you wont regret trying it although you may regret trying it because it is very scary game for all horror lovers download it no tips if you are too scared turn off speaker and play May
early access review its free for a limited time so get it quickly the game play is awesome a tough there are not that many game modes yet but more will be added and the graphics look pretty neat its everything i ever wanted i highly recommend this game
early access review the learning curve is too deep in usually good with learning curves but could never figure this one out so if you art good with very difficult things then done play this game cause it is difficult also none of the elements balance out each other the main story is so difficult that on the second deck i wanted i couldn't beat any of the bosses you take your pick on why this game is bad
early access review am an david collectible card game player high level gwent player and constant legend rank elder scrolls legends player so you can believe my review this game lacks creativity within its decks and their is only a few top tier decks from what i can see the game is not pay to play but its pay to progress so done expect to be at the top unless you have two hundred hours for grinding or two hundred dollars us the game lacks variety in its play style i versed the same decks copy and pasted so long story short it is full of net decker i despise net decker who lack creativity and go for what is statistically overpowered rather than fun unfortunately all card games suffer from statistically overpowered cards but most get fixed eventually eternal cards for over a year have had the same broken cards at the top with no editing to their power levels the developers are dir wolf and i now understand why dir wolf has recently been replaced by a new development team for the elder scrolls legends they re incapable of making a balanced game but maybe its intentional for money grabbing i would say ditch this game unless you have a small brain with a long attention span for boring games and love brooding over new players with your pay to play net decked build i say seek a different collectible card game eternal one hundred and ten i got one point for having yeti cards other than that their is no selling point the art style is tragic too colourful seems to be illustrated by an obnoxious kid with too many crayons
fun to play with friends at least until your team mates start being toxic and tell you that you re doing the worst and they'll report you for no reason unless you disable chat i do not recommend the community in game is toxic as hell
early access review a thumb up for this game yea i know this game have a lot of bugs but its normal its a are alpha why i give a thumb up because this game get very often a great update free am the deus are very often on the forum and read our wishes goff topics and robot creations this is not a matter of course but they do this and i like this key back to the game pros many updates for creative user is this game a good choose the developers free am are very often on the forums the fights are short you can play this when ever you want the weapons are really balanced if the servers down free am are so nice and give promotion codes one day premium over wolf work with rob craft the game is very fast to download the traffic is interesting contras a lot of bugs the chat is to colourful for merry for my bad english ramon aka hamsun mike
perm death with a shop next to the spawn point let that soak in i would play it but i done feel like dealing with that dynamic right now free to play though so i wont knock it but pay to win if you re impatient
hello am a passionate defense of the ancients two player i generally play at least sixty seven hours of defense of the ancients two everyday and i am trying to improve myself day by day i have never used any cheat programs recently live got a lot of reports from data two community i can see the reason of getting reported every game of defense of the ancients two because of that i get a lot of reports from enemies and my teammates i done even abandon any game i am a human being too people get angry i get angry too but most of my games i try to be chill when there is no support i pick support when nobody buys courier i buy courier even if i play offline in that game every two week i play two hundred thousand two hundred and fifty hours of defense of the ancients two i really love to play this game i buy compendiums data as well i like your products so i believe that a misjudgement happened to me just because people done like my playing or i play good on one hero doesn't mean they can report me i would like to see if you guys can investigate my six months ban in looking forward to hearing from you thank you in advance have a great day
you may notice that i have zero hours on record playing digital combat simulator world that because i play it through the eagle dynamics digital combat simulator world launcher i had that originally with some downloadable content before steam offered it as far as i know digital combat systems is the only software company that is dedicated to making true to life simulations if your into flight simulators and you love the military planes this is a must have the downloadable content that you buy for this is well worth it these are not your run of the mill games the learning curve is quite high but if you dedicate the time to learning the sims you will know what it feels like to be a combat pilot hell it took me multiple nights of playing just to learn how to start up the a and you think that its easy to take off in a a mustang that what i thought too until i went turning to the left on the runway smack dab into a building i didst know that you need to compensate for a factor hell didst know what a factor was until started playing this simulator what in trying to say is that when it comes to simulators for the personal computer it done get any closer to the real thing than it does with digital combat simulator simulators may
this game is a a a a king joke this is not random this is just laughing at players face you cant do anything you done have a chance to even show some skills this game is just a a a king you so hard that you done even have fun playing with your friends just buy normal monopoly some beer pizza and meet your friends cause games like this a a a a a are taking your life away in polish jan a a a a a a a a a co zap a a a a a a a
interesting concept but severely lacking in any support or instruction for brand new players i was literally dropped into the game world with no idea what i was supposed to be doing and no tutorial or guide missions or anything just dumped in the middle of nowhere with a flashlight after wandering around for a while aimlessly with nothing happening i just gave up and quit the game also i found zero ave servers despite the game being set up to be able to have some you think that beginner servers would be ave while players got used to the game mechanics but apparently the deus couldn't be bothered doing that either great concept decent graphics for it but massively lacking in any kind of new player supports common to pretty much every other game on the market huge let down and in its current form is not worth bothering with ill come back and try this game again in the future after the deus have had time to expand it and upgrade my review as appropriate
i installed the free version on my computer using an oculus rift none of my controls work on my box game controller or my motion controllers i cannot stand the fact you have to use keyboard and monitor also i did finally get into the menu and start a flight but none of the buttons worked it states this works with oculus no it dost
early access review really enjoyed my first match of this game it reminds of me star conflict meets league of legends capture the points kill the enemy capture the main base super fun very colourful and pretty intense
smite is one of the best mobs i have played besides data two the majority of the community is very friendly and helpful i would recommended smite to anyone that is new to mobs it int easy to get the hang of but after about one hundred hours you should have a good understanding of the game
live played this game for a while now i think about twenty hours at this point on different worlds my world my friends private world and a public world i haven even fully explored everything in the game yet though i do have a good understanding of the game limo laugh out loud and id say this is a pretty good free to play alternative to another well known block mining game cough min craft cough pros free to play lots to do addicting easy to spend hours in a single session playing and losing track of timeless you be very creative the name says it all local play with friend huge worlds to explore cons sometimes there lag when moving or maybe that just my bad computer laugh out loud it doesn't really take away from the game limo but its noticeable you have to pay for the pro version for certain features i especially want this for the flashlight by in terrified of the dark mines however these features a rent necessary for the game and you can play the game entirely without it but if you re a free to play player you cant make a new world this means you can only play in your starter world a friends world or a public world i kind of wish free to play players could at least make one more world but if you want to create another world for whatever reason you need to buy the pro version however its a one time payment and its not too terribly expensive so its not that bad my rating seven hundred and ten
this game started out very promising it was a fun grind with lots of different permutations of options in terms of towersupgradesbloons however when you start playing battle modes and go against anyone above one hundred win two hundred they just spam you with either blimps or in zebra blooms blimps you can sell your and buy stuff quick enough to stop but when they spam regent zebra blooms its game over one hundred of the time live lost thousands from hundreds to actual two thousands and four thousands bets against these stupid spamming kids there is literally no way to counter it no matter what i do i done try to do it to others because that dirty and i say late game and mean it when somebody says late game and then zebra or blimp spams you early you should have an option to block them so you never have to play against them or with them again there should be a report option for the idiots who say late game and then done late game honestly its the dirtiest thing ever its like saying you haven looked at your cards in poker and having the nuts or saying you'll quick scope battle someone in cod and then knifing them or pulling out a machine gun i done know how you sleep at night if you play like this but hopefully with a knife through your in skull when someone you spam out like a noon tracks you down and kills you in your in bed in in tired of losing all my money and having to wait eight hours over and over for spins because in way ahead and some in kid spams me with in zebra to good game if you want to break your mousekeyboardclosest thing to your computer monitor however if you re a rational human being done download this game even though its free it will cost you more than other games because of the rage it induces not to mention there are a bunch of trolls in the comments and in most games absolute trash you only get to pick three towers which is meant to be tactical but leaves lower levels stuck on certain towers having not had the money to purchase higher level tiers yet and forces you to pick banana farm as one of your towers banana farm forced meta is just in gay
a quite frankly fantastic hunting game that deserves to be played because of its rich content and unique experience but utterly ruined by the pay enjoy model this game is atrocious when it comes to nickle and dining its customers everything that is not a rabbit or a specific kind of deer will cost you money you will find no enjoyment in this game without paying money and that is its biggest sin rather than making this a fun game where you can pay for boosts silly clothes and extras they made this into a hunting game where you cant hunt ninety of the animals in the game without paying a monthly fee disastrous and crippling to what would have otherwise been a fantastic game heck if i had bought this at thirty for just the single player id be a happy customer however in not sinking over sixty a year into this game for occasional play this is a game you play when you want a switch from things want to relax or just want to see if you can finally catch that animal you saw a couple of weeks ago it is not worth the bloody massively multiplayer online like subscription fees in any sense of the word do not buy anything because this game doesn't give two a about your enjoyment and if you play be prepared to be bored out of your in mind after your twentieth mule deeps done be deceived by my steam stats i have played this game since twenty twelves into twenty thirteen and early twenty fourteen and got thoroughly sick of it each time that i just hit the uninstall button after killing my thousandth animal that i could harvest because i needed to pay money for a license
early access review at this stage this game not even working took me about fifteen restarts in order to get this game to load when it final loaded i was running it at fps on low settings on high end gaming personal computer
creatives is incredibly fun for those who enjoy the farming and building genre at times game play can be very repetitive and early game play leaves you feeling incredibly underpowered that being said once you start to get some decent gear and understanding of the game it does become very enjoyable the devices and mechanisms can make for incredibly fun and entertaining buildings and the massive world is fun to explore all in all a very fun experience
early access review awesome game live tried a few magic hearthstone gwent it center this is the perfect balance between hearthstone and magic love it been playing on steam and my iphone and i cant stop i haven put one dime in it yet and still get hours of play in it i strongly recommend this if you are looking for a good collectible card game
early access review lazy developers and a smart crew tat keep saying its all good when its not abusers or exploiter free pass they say days block aka vacations is enough for this people if they get it at all economy flooded with their gold pal transferring items flying in player versus player and the worst is the optimization
to everyone saying it is optimized you can configure the in i yourself and the game runs great hopefully they will address this to improve the experience for those that do not know how or are too lazy to do this themselves they also fixed the issue of players getting stuck on the splash screen on the official early access launch and it was only a problem for the two days for those who repurchased and we were compensated for that with twenty of in game currency live also had a solid connection since i started playing with no lag whatsoever so i done know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag as for the game it is a blast combat is fluid intuitive and makes player versus player really intense the open world factions based like wow player versus player is always a good time cant wait for the upcoming player versus player content in the next week or two side quests are actually fun but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically receive a quest to kill that monster pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster you also can gain dungeon points doing these pet system is awesome hilarious and adds quite a bit of depth to the game there are a crazy amount of pets mounts to tame you can upgrade pets to gain different abilities and the same goes with mounts you use other pets as an ingredient but it can be a little grind it is an massively multiplayer online talents are really fun and what you craft is actually valuable worthwhile there is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting gear can be upgraded and infused and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more boobs it also looks great and there a rent just a ton of redskins of similar items there could be more sets but what is there is very nice i just hope they add more content like they say they are going to as i will be here for awhile only complaint is nerf guardian and add more stuff classes levels end game content hope the community doesn't let such a beauty die id love to see this game flower into its full potential
in gonna go detailed on this one sorry for bad english this is my opinion of data community when people supporting the team as a support her first ten minutes enemy dewar sward ward ward ward ward ward ward again no response in three second stang ina no support when killing an enemy i kill steal i need money duh do some supporting this one really get in my nerve when i take bounty run carries good game in not gonna be fat when i try to be a nice carry when picking heroes me picking wiki here can someone support all pick age first two minutes eye lion can you buy ward why me you think in a lion and i have to support mid game wait i need farm and plus done farm you not playing family relate game you not fat stupid you had one job farming but i thought were not playing farm shut up good game not when i try playing mid when enemy first blood young mid ill report when you decide to farm a little more and la stupid report this mid not zero respect for the newbies keep calling them boobs done play uninstall data wont change a thing anyway toxic deadly not inspiring full of hate words community done try this game if you cant control your self there plenty game in steam that with great community game the game itself are great you can choose one from fifty heroes with different skill set and animation what make data two fun and addictive because the knowledge skill about data that you got from experiencing a lot of playing or someone taught you used to defending your ancient or your he and destroying theirs while doing this you can and must collaborate with your other four teammates with different heroes and skill set to try make the best offers defense really really enjoyable if you play with your friends or family well guess now what if you got a toxic teammate done bother banking together make one mistake may get you reported and mocked tips if you want enjoy data for a long time make sure you have friend family playing it too if you ever play a single game and you met this stranger with fun attitude forgiving yet teaching know ways of data commend them and done scared to ask if they want to be your steam friend because kind like them are extremely rare its like getting mew in community play it with friends or family overall for me feel free to comment on agree or disagree i will respond remember done be a hate in data two may
smites characters is actual religious gods you play these religious gods you can learn their lore you finally figure out how to pronounce their names you see how bands sexy gods are this game is totally on the top three mobs and it has a low key educational value as well
product received for free you shout judge the game by what people say even if they spent six years and so on on the game the games free to play with years of worth of content for you to explore i have been looking for an massively multiplayer online to play that worth investing my time time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap i have six hours on record i wont lie to you game is good try it it has everything an massively multiplayer online needs to have and more the game int ruined by what people say it int pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing if you are looking for that classic feel look no other this games got history it has attribute and it will consume you just give it a go you can always uninstall for more information about subscriptions it center here help equal
i will never recommend this game the matchmaking is super bad if you are a low rank like me the other players start bulling you because they are diamond gods the system done match you with players of your lever is do bad the players start saying to report the person because is new of my friend got reported so many times because he didst select the god they want it and got suspended on smite las update suspension wave smite only answer to him in small word you got reported we will suspend you without checking if the report is truth or not
early access review ill echo what many others are saying no just no i am well versed and used to bad launches of server issues or what not of an massively multiplayer online but given that bless has been an ongoing project since twenty twelves and released in three regions prior to steam there has to be some semblance of experience after all these years trust me save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west promotion marketing they advertised this game as local optimized and new combat mechanism upon days early of early release this is not the case by a long shot they marketed to your hype and released none of it matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas i get the language is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate would be done better optimization is just not there you have to edit your own in i files if you want a semblance of performance out of that unreal engine do yeah a dinosaur new combat after many complained about the new combat being removed except for workers to polish it more this this is not being transparent after happily stealing downloadable content money to make it clear if they said it in advance many would be been of in waiting emissary event was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release emissaries were you tubers to try represent or even help hype the game many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to deus apparently some drama went down with them too needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status early day launch needless to say that it was a waste of time one thing is to wait in queue another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line wait which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option that is issues as of this post its still iffy believe it or not a user in geddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didst connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation collectors editions items are all character bound no way to move them no way to given them to an alt with the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join good luck your pack just got wasted am of with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason also the lumens in game currency was character bound they said to be a known issue while you couldn't use their shop if you wanted more problem here is they never communicated whats a known issue and what int see a trend in game they warn you its nonrefundable yeah right people got their money back nice try servers they continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time am no tech expert but amazon servers were used for wow legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen so while opening new ones are nice it splits up remade guilds and your precious already burned founders items poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here planning of only one server is oceanic south america north america carr bean get the point road map they have a vague one laid out most of it is the same from the three other regions but as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under steams early access policies to bide themselves some time therefore many of earlier region content was striped away heres the thing when you meet a person and give that first handshake that first introduction it says a lot about who you are be wiz who are you becoming new overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work do you know what they did differently open forums discussions podcasts whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with transparency war frame and of are to name a few here you have been hearing feedback yes but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say i heard you come out of that closet face us more often and get that feedback and just talk talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of for emissaries that are jumping ship also lets say your afraid you done want to face an audience then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with in short i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you be wiz make a change its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention at that point what happens to you should you prove to turn this around and do better then ill update my review just no until then moneys is better spent elsewhere when you could've made this a beta to help you test instead of a no refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried original post may the edit and follow up hmm where to start i still wouldn't suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone make your own informed decision for what thirty thousand one hundred and fifty is worth to you soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the games release from there a few patches that as i mentioned above catered to whomever yells the loudest some of these changes are being thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider he mob nerf not to mention that each patch note doesn't include full disclosure still for example first two dungeons used to drop gear guaranteed each boss now it doesn't to match end level dungeons where you have ring of a drop rate for ring of it being of your class events boy are they throwing events left and right the last gather rafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or al bank content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible i for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised do was actually asked of them and yet they weren't sure about it further confirms as a vague road map as i mentioned above dupe items scandal it was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed it demonstrates a rolled back build further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content not a full rework of went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell as for those involved in the duping few days ban and items were kept so they say apparently they are listening to feedback through their discord and with some emissaries i fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within two weeks performance has been the key main factor in all the regions performance performance sixty million later performance they already stole your money and mine with lack of transparency whats a few please wait more soon to make you more gullible sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience twitter geddit the fault was in the deus team mostly for releasing a game where class could shot things now that adjustments make sense no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo links system works its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down read practice but they seem addicted to preference already latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition they show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound this on its own is unnecessary to founders gold is account bound and am willing to bet that an issue on the code unintended yet the in game dollar currency lumina is not may
all these casuals with less than twenty hours playtime done know anything at first you might think why would anyone play this game its just another clicker game that where everyone is wrong how many clicker games have anime girls that moan none how many clicker games have a custom table waif none how many clicker games have enemies that all have boobs once again none this game is definitely on top of the list of clicker games moans and boobs ten outta ten best game ever and as for those saying they regret the fact that people can see that they played this done be stay proud you played this amazing masterpiece
early access review to sum it up pay to win you start off playing training missions and for the most part is is quite fun the games mechanics are not on par with other world war two shooters out there such as do source or more importantly red orchestra two but you re willing to look past that because of the overarching goal to win the war and the fact that the games progression gives you incentives to keep playing unfortunately its when you rank up and step out of training missions into the campaign missions where the game comes undone whilst it is refreshing to finally see the game as it was meant to be played that is with multiple goals and not just the domination game type in the training missions you'll often be outnumbered or outnumber the enemy team and crush them not only that but you'll start playing against people who have spent inordinate amounts of money on ridiculous weapon mods that will one shot you and they'll also take a the amount of damage of a normal person due to some insane perk they unlocked via money yes you can grind to attain some of these advantages but it is a long and arduous grind not something the average person could hope to attain in willing to have some iffy balance in a world war two game seeing as in real life battles are not always fair but when you get the drop on a guy who is peddling a bike you put six rounds into him and then he jumps off his bike only to one shot kill you it is incredibly frustrating something that i very much get in a to match is the feel of war bullets whizzing over my head soldiers writhing in pain artillery raining down close to me all these things are just non existent in he half the time you wont even hear the shot that killed you the audio in general is awful pros progression is definitely there you feel like there is an overarching goal to win the war cons wonky mechanics not as good as other current world war two shooters on the market pay to win or if you are not fond of that term pay to advance awful balancing no visceral war feeling recommendation go buy red orchestra two
matchmaking is not that bad but there is room for some improvements specially in ranked duel also this is not pay to win by any means sure there are some paid events here and there but they done affect game play at all and the community is not toxic compared to other games like counter strike go if you end up playing this game please please please done inst lock i admit i used to do it a lot one last thing loki cancer just done pick him of
early access review horrible game even more broken than magic combos ranked matches you bronze with golden and above ranked players make no sense they have better cards and better knowledge of the game cards you didst even know existed its ray bad
free to play but pay money if you want to win online matches the online mode unevenly ranks you into matches with people who have been playing for at least two years or more or just people who have paid money to have better cards the only thing worth doing for free in this game is the story mode and then uninstalling
the release of the elder scrolls legends on steam is great news for fans of collectible card game competitive card games and the elder scrolls franchise first and foremost it is not pay town each and every card can be crafted with soul gems equivalent of hearthstone dust now those of you migrating from hearthstone might bring up grinding fortunately very less grinding is required and here are the reasons why one you can play against the expert artificial intelligence in practice mode and get fifteen gems for each win this is hard capped at three hundred gems per day with this rate you can get a legendary card in just four days if you are so inclined for comparison in hearthstone it takes you a month to get a legendary two this game will award you cards gold just for levelling up your character the soul gems awarded to a player at the beginning are very generous and can help you craft cards needed to make a budget deck i have been playing since just three days and already have forty four of the cards three you can always play the solo versus arena to get higher rewards depending on how much you win three wins will net you more than you invest reasons why you should play test over hearthstone one less ring more skill there are no cards with random effects yet and the game is actually surprisingly balanced having no overpowered class or archetype as such two with the way blizzard is approaching expansions in hearthstone you will have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to even play slightly competitive four thousand and three the rune and prophecy mechanics discourage aggro face hunter face is the place decks which form much of the meta in lower ranked games effectively making low ranked hearthstone games stale four an free to play player can actually compete with wallet warriors providing hesse is willing to be patient for a while not hearthstone patient laugh out loud there are many free to play players who have hit the legend rank absolute highest rank i see a bright future for this game hearthstone always left a void which other cogs failed to fill this game just might be the one
pro anxiety inducing game play which is what a horror game should have interesting visual style good comical moments lots of jump carson walking simulator really with there was more to this game than moving from room to room running from misc ladies perhaps puzzles or obs tical that increase difficulty when the slower monsters are fallowing you however for what it is spooky house of jump scares is great interesting enough to keep you captivated for long periods of time
this game consists of many half naked waifs and domestic violence disguised by the waifs moans be it pleasure or pain who cares right its quite incredible because you can beat your while you beat the waif a whole new level of next generation gaming is now realised thanks to the perfection of laura clicker you can even expand the realism of this game by cuddling up to a body pillow of a hot anime grill and enjoy an evening of domestic violence and the moaning waif together this game is flawless i give it a solid ten because of its perfection and not because of the stiff i got
the developers ruined this game they can to a program a simple hit box properly and multiple other things they removed the dodge for most cases i have a suggestion for the developers stop making new legends and fix the problems already existing within the game if you don to fix those problems those problems will be in the new legends you people make the developers obviously do not listen to their player base since people have complained about this and still are what a in joke
early access review this game real need a report function and a way of muting players when you have to play with little kids that think its funny to spread racist and nazi all the time it can get very annoying
early access review this game needs to have some sort of practice mode because if you re new and just starting off you cant compete against everyone else who has been playing for hours already and has a better handle of things with a decent learning curve it doesn't make sense to practice waiting a few minutes each time to find a squad and deploy only to play for fifteen seconds before you get killed how am i supposed to practice and get better and whats the use of spending more time setting up and entering a game as opposed to actually playing it when you get killed almost immediately no use i heard there was a death match mode previously that was useful for practice and getting better but they apparently removed that so in moving on to a new game bye
early access review more optimized and more fun than pub with lots of unique ideas that make it stand out from other battle royal games this is the most fun live had with the genre and in glad to see roe is getting the recognition it deserves by placing in steams top ten as of late
waited for this game for six years since it was first previewed and couldn't wait for it tried it in russia korean rebuild and japan all of these versions were better despite the optimization issues and slow combat japanese version was actually of in the combat just needed a slight increase in speed then came the a version cheats were everywhere and dupes still existed from previous version regions that were known about for years optimization was still never fixed cheaters users received slaps on the wrist absurd gear time releases made the factions imbalanced quickly server merges made it even worse despite the company knowing that it would be this way the people representing the company in the discord were terrible childish dismissive to legitimate complaints about not only the game but other staff members rules not enforced in person would be kicked after five minutes of voicing concern over the game yet someone with a racist slur in their name was brought up to every single staff member and it took five hours before someone would do anything about it after bringing it up a second time overall a terrible experience in game and interaction with the company in the discord i had minor issues with optimization but dealt with it for awhile finally decided that they weren't going to fix any legitimate complaints and that this version was going to suffer the same fate as all of the other regions any new version that came out would get the spotlight and the previous ones would be forgotten about this version is about to get the same treatment because of the box version that in the works
early access review unless deus wont make crappy decisions to speedup alpha to beta release process under the pressure of investors it could be made into some glorious spaceships player versus player game eve never been
early access review all the memories of playing brawl on wii years back came flooding in super fun game with awesome characters downloaded it today and live been playing for four hours straight now i wont lie tho i think the game is awesome but there are some cons as well as its many perks perks easy controller very alike sub which is good to me room for mechanics interesting characters copy graphics fun modes to play with friends consol have to save up a lot of gold to buy one so called legend and the only ones you can play for free are the ones who are on the weekly free rotation a bit buggy some times for me atlas only way to get skins and new weapons is to buy in game money for real money and yes there skins not to many characters to choose from few items to use in matches but as i said i wont lie and i enjoy the game really much the flaws are something i personally can live with recommended
i played never winter for a long time i go tot where i would buy via every month because it made things easier like being able to pull up a map and go where you want no matter where you are i did not have to pay to play but the option was there if you want to i played a long time i have taken a long break and am back playing again its a good online role playing game and i made some friends when i played before its really good for a free game i recommend it and the game can be played without buying anything get together with some friends and play together that will be more fun
i done get this live been waiting to connect for over an hour once i load the loading screen it says disconnected from the server all the time and four times i finally got to join and it says you've been killed by a zombie whf is happening
imbalanced tank fighting german tanks seem to have paper for arm or its a common joke that this game is biased to russians but the reality is that it is true the grind is a pain to follow and you'll end up being targets for people who have premium tanks have grinder for hours without end just go find a better tank game cause this is no good
a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
early access review seems interesting so far id need more time to play as the game develops the concept seems good in theory the flight controls do seem a bit sluggish to me id enjoy them more if they were closer to actual space flight lateral movements a rent possible the controls behave more of a earthbound aircraft than spaceflight
for the first four attempts at playing this st the screen went black just at the part you never wanted it to full of loot night coming in and out in the open you would be forgiven for thinking this is a plot or i just got hacked and when i did get back into the server yea i was dead but spawned one hundred yards from my loot and graphic glitch then total crash of my machine not fri in happy with that at all of and before you get into spouting update your system and drivers well they were just updated the day before trying this and live been of for the last six machines i have built re another black screen from nowhere but the play went on as i could hear the grunting sponge heads close to me however i did recover the screen ont ask i hit multiple keys to get it back somehow the another lockup black screen again and finally i got the screen back only to find i had been kicked for not playing laugh out loud what a load of but then the fifth time i got to play for a further four hours without a glitch hack lockup kick or any problems at all i think the ten year old hacker had to go to bed for school the next day only kidding there guys but when i did get a good run at it i got the feeling it was an aftermath clone with some good improvements like the shop and the bar and such seven hundred and ten i give it seven out of ten mostly because its free to load and play with a little more attention to removing the graphic freezes the author could ask a fair price for the game its worth a go if you can get a few hour play without any problems of bow i didst change the server or the country eur in all the game play
early access review this is a great game for an early excess who ever reading this buy it so there will be more people to play with against a it has pretty simple controls and doesn't have that many buttons or things to consider you can jump right in after tutorial and have some fun if you are looking for a game that is more complicating taking into account of many aspects within the game like eve then this might not be the game for you hope to see more from the developers
everyone who reads this have played offline online diabolo ii beaten in minimum five times and still having though of returning for one more round also most of us migrated to diabolo three after playing it of numerous hours and seasons we can say this with pure honesty this is what diabolo three should have looked like end of story rip diabolo
fun game with some interesting ideas that falls apart into a pay to win mess if you really try to play it like a traditional most has a massive amount of content both from the development team and use generated through their map editor and really you could do a lot worse if you re just looking to waste some time and have some fun on a free game its fun even if you play it as a single player action game i rate this game three out of five pay walled races
early access review an offer great fun at zero cost if you play the game for the dailies and in between other activities games you can be competitive and or have fun has a short single player campaign that works more as a tutorial from holding your hand on the first steps to chasing after you with a a flamethrower campaign includes rewards from single random cards to entire starter decks aside from the campaign single player offers a puzzle mode for mediocre rewards the main focus of the puzzles is entertainment however a lot of the puzzles offer insights on obscure mechanics that otherwise would take a lot of experimenting to figure out the gauntlet mode also under single player is what the name implies go through all the bouts with an increasingly difficult artificial intelligence to receive gold the free to play currency and card card packs it is free to participate in which is reasonable given the rage it induces with bullshit artificial intelligence at higher tiers for people that are there for just the gold it is very punishing as a single defeat takes you out and not until the fifth out of seven victories will you start seeing any worthwhile rewards the forge mode is a cheaper draft mode against the artificial intelligence as it is cheaper the rewards are also inferior accessible to new players and good to fetch faction specific color win or lose you get to keep the picked cards forge mode forces you to use a two color deck so you can limit what you get with the first few picks if you win all your fights you should get enough gold to participate again even a bit of profit under the player versus player flag you have the casual and ranked game types which are common in most games these days there is a season reward for ranked and draft more on this game type below casual and ranked are free to compete in there is also an event mode under the player versus player section which varies i do not recommend participating unless you have a good collection otherwise you'll just be feeding other people getting reward packs at regular value and wasting precious currency that could be better spent under forge or draft a very generous draft system you pick forty eight cards out of four packs paying a bit extra for this opportunity twenty victory or loss will get you the forty eight cards but do try your best as rewards a rent shabby at all and if you score nice on the rank ladder you get even more rewards even being bad if you participate in five draft sets you will get at the very least an extra pack at the end of the season topping this off you have daily doable quests that can be exchanged once per day for a different quest also you have periodic theme quests three days i think where you get a free theme deck and are asked to win five times with a deck with those colours not necessarily the one offered it is a very good game do yourself a favour and go through the basic campaign and play twenty three matches in each game mode before you come to a decision
despite all the reactions you'll get from lovers and hater this game is free play so i do recommend anyone to try it if you like it then continue playing it but if you done then no harm is done and just uninstall it from your system its that easy cant get easier than that well you can just not play the game but do you want to do that without satisfying your curiosity remember human is curious of nature just like cats except trying this game wont kill a personal opinion of the game i like it and currently liking it a lot since its based on one of my favourite past time dungeons dragons doesn't matter any edition coz in a fan of all of it if you re a real and fan and not a and purist who tends to stick to just one rules replay then this is a game for you me be just until you finish the main storyline or get to level seventy with one or more characters
certainly a building game i enjoy i have high hopes and cant wait to see the improvements coming soon i think the best thing about this game is that it is a great free to play in that its fun to get good packs and build cool things while friends can still come and play with you very popular game with my gaming group brick barons want to see what i did check out my base at dark servery dark and teleport to do the creative or look up my adventure lab escape artistic adventure by do the creative pros create epic cool bases and fill pm with loot many friends can join with little problems pay money to get stuff invite friends to your base for frees around like logic as in turning lights on or opening doors and such cons you have to start over for every server or world sometimes blueprints are consistent and that is nice reporters can cause lag like a lot limited free to play settings kind of forces you to play servers instead of your own world on creative grind its a linear grind not a lot of creativity there i would like you to see this link for a large list of suggestions i done make these for every game i play i post ideas here as i get them tips steam community
i have been trying since the first week of june twenty eighteen when i purchased these items to get the world war two missions to work for the pm i purchased the normandy map and the world war two asset pack all i get to fly is free flight dog fight against a couple of bus i have tried to fly bomber escort find ground targets it center to no avail have asked numerous times for help from norm eagle dynamics support but this issue is never resolved have asked for a refund on the normandy map and the world war two asset pack and was told that it has been to long have been asking for help from the start no more purchases from me until this is corrected will now seek legal assistance just for the principle of it at this time i do not recommend this game due to the lack of support will edit this review if satisfaction is received June
no reason to have this on personal computer play the original wot it is also free and is better in every way and the graphics settings in wot do go down if your personal computer can play this it can play wot on low just fine
a mediocre mobile game gorged with such grotesque micro transactions as premium ammunition premium consumables paypal locked vehicles and equipment paypal locked upgrades payt skip grind monthly subscription benefits and paypal locked cosmetics keep your money and your time away from these gold digging wretches and play something less willing to throw away all dignity for the contents of your wallet
the only game that makes you your pants if you see a flying object the only game that lets you shoot down planes in a as aircraft and makes you feel good about it the only game that has the satisfying feeling of actually destroying something the only game that lets you eject when things get frisky this int a game this is a simulator
its very much a mobile style game and it has micro transactions but you done need to purchase anything to have fun in fact the depth and options in this game put a lot of these self described triple games to shame it may not be right for you but its free to try quick learning curve if you like strategy puzzles role playing game sims theme parks and a builders you will find something in here to enjoy in running win ten with no issues on a top end rig pleasant surprise five of five guys May
early access review well its really not bad but its not that good either i did enjoy my time playing it though however i can see how it would get dull pretty fast worth a try you got nothing to lose
good when you figure out the controls or when you figure out to configure your controller but its free and of course you have to pay for some cars you want but that your decision
early access review side from all of the bugs that usually plague mos during launch i a server queues lag and disconnects the game is really bad right off the bat i noticed how horrible the graphics were for everything besides the characters and beasts armours would looks splotchy and blurred while edges on many objects were not smooth at all the voice over choices available for character voices seemed as if it was just the same person repeating words with the sound being slightly distorted to make it different while creating my character i found that there were a lot of missing features and options that would have made it stellar features such as the ability to change the fur color using a choice of basic spectrum was outright missing color such as black silver or white were all simply missing from their color palette i guess the deus have never seen the color black on fur before another thing that threw me off was that every customized character image i managed to save was faction locked which is infuriating in itself if one wishes to remake their character on a different server now on to the abysmal game play the movement system uses the old hold rob to turn the camera with was for moving the character around that would have been tolerable if only there was an option to remap key binds there want even one as far as i could tell after searching through the entire user interface old bless online is another massively multiplayer online flop overall rating one hundred and ten
early access review if you done mind playing with hackers and find a good server without any in then this game is fantastic fun if you do mind this then done play also if you do play only aim for the head as hitting the body will result in your death all custer disables are pad for with real world money replay is fast like cod and you buy weapons like in csc so be it the graphics are a little out dated but all in all a fun little first person shooter
the developers of rob craft are now just money hungry like my friend told me rob craft is now pay to win crap the developers are now just money hungry to actually have fun you have to buy premium which is expensive this game is crap soon to conclude this you free am your business model is i am not playing this any more you free am in done edit almost two more years after writing this i still think this game is literal and a bad free to play game
early access review never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you ever gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye never gonna tell a lie and hurt you ever gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you ever gonna make you cry never gonna say goodbye never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
early access review balance int done right i got instant killed every time by the pro to seeker weapons are also too expensive plus with this new pro to seeker and missile launcher and aero flak there literally no point in playing air vehicles matchmaking also sucks i done actually like the new update where a can install multiple weapons on a robot it makes every robot almost identical well i haven played this game for long so i may be wrong but i wont recommend this at all in my opinion good concept but not done right every free to play game ever most of them May
early access review today ill be reviewing rob craft or what is left from it after the amount of updates to make deus more money so to start this off rob craft was a great game i played it a long time ago when there were tiers the system worked like this you buy an item the item has robot ranking if your robot ranking is high enough you advance to next tier where only bots from the same tier are or from higher if you had a party the way the money worked was pretty straight forward you can buy with real money special points which can get you anything from tech points to the weapons you cant afford but as much as i can say it was pretty balanced and not pay to win the system is currently really terrible because of multiple reasons pretty much you can share your robot done take this the wrong way its a nice touch that you can try other players but this pretty much killed the must for building your own so much stuff was changed tech tree was completely removed so now everyone can buy anything this means you can get against yourself five lock on missile launchers that are pretty much undo gable unless you have an obstacle between you and the robot that shoots them the thing i loved in old rob craft was the amount of free premium codes there were so many premium codes for free to help you climb i feel like its rare to have any currently the most terrible thing however is that you no longer drop raw money from battles depending on your position in ladder you get a box that varies on rarity obviously the better you play the better you get to get most money deus made it that you get forty eight items but half of them are only for premium users what has actually happened to me was getting multiple legend aries why is that bad they were all in the premium only section and i didst have premium to or the deus ruined this game from its original version which was playable without tons of pay to win content
early access review cdr rob craft was once a fun game but it int anymore be played this game for a long time i played it for a while before linking it to my steam account and some more since for a long time it was an awesome game with awesome features and a great overall concept the development team obviously cared about their players at some point within the last two years or so that changed rob craft is now a bloated unbalanced pay town mess the deus spat in the faces of veteran players by removing many of the features that the players had relied on tech tree and tiring system and replacing them with confusing overhauls tailored to their new paradigm i attempted to live with the changes i revamped my old robots to fit the new changes but that didst really change anything the players who had been playing under the new system longer simply had the advantage of better invested resources i couldn't go back and invest the resources i had already spent on things that are useful now that weren't before the changes put veteran players at a disadvantage have produced awful game play i cant recommend this game even for free
this is why steam needs a neutral review option the game was at one point my massively multiplayer online of choice but overtime it faded making bad decision after bad decision after bad decision i still look back fondly at my times in this game and the only reason i have three hundred hours is leaving the launcher open on accident in reality i have what may be thousands of hours in this game and can tell you that if you want an massively multiplayer online world were there is a great amount of lore then try it if you want difficulty then look up project nineteen ninety ines which is based off of ever quest one a much better game it will always have a special place in my heart but its more like a bad romance where i have to leave it but cant help and remember he good times May
live read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguing because they look similar because both characters have red headed swordsman female elf archers and purple haired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other but where the difference ends story the story is that a stone called the al were stolen by bandits and its up to the al search party to get it back the story moves on to each village to move the story the al stone story ends at alter when you finish the quest turning everything back to normal then story goes to feta with an demon invasion the story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or auto characters there are currently nine characters on both versions what surprises me about them are that thirty nine characters included demons chung ara han and telesis the character are els word rena aisha raven eve lung ara han telesis and the insane add i like add the most because of his backstory game play and personality reminds me of laser corm from smash games i feel mad for raven chung ara and add raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who a can fight in the first dungeon in alter chung dad got possessed and almost died from severe injuries ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon final boss of camel and add family got killed not by demons sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation the backstories surprises me with any way thank a south korea game play by combing your enemies to oblivion through special actives skills when a reach level fifteen you'll be able to choose multiple paths three for els word rena aisha raven eve and chung two for ara and telesis and currently one for add at the time you will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend two hundred ching and you'll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the second job at level thirty five either quest line or pay four hundred ching you re pick what i really love about els word is he final dungeons the final dungeons supply you experience for you to level up and a challenging boss there a dungeon called heirs time and space which actually a boss rush mode live seen videos of player beating it with they re best time there are also secret dungeons when a get to the level cap seventy however there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields when all of the stamina runs you cant dungeon until three thirty am pop the match making is absolutely broken my level fort two els word is set with a max level telesis you start playing player versus player at level ten its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later community the only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms cash shop i cant get enough with the cash shop costumes check quick slot extensions check pet and mounts check inventory expansion check final verdict i love this games with a passion i have over five hundred hours in to this game and my highest level is a add combo monsters to oblivion the gam play is good player versus player is below average the stamina can get annoying but who cares ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ten

business tour overeat business tour pub business tour call of duty business tour battlefield business tour the witch business tour dark soul business tour any game would recommend it
a yes one of valves in house gems team fortress two is a timeless classic that i would call similar to a fine wine it only gets better with age with the community still going strong and always new content its no surprise that with its goofy art style and genre defining game play that team fortress two has been going strong for eleven years heres to eleven more
fairly good game that can pass the time quite nicely however its a shame about all the downloadable content to get the extras but overall a fairly good game if you would like to study the inner workings of guns
early access review the launcher has a bit coin miner imbedded in it and it tracks your in so done get this in orders are bret rid of it by searching how to remove a given agent
from what i understand the free play portion of the game has become more expansive with a rotating roster for free locations and licenses i personally pay for the game bought a starter pack to get a few months of unlimited licenses unlimited ammo and a bunch of permanent weapons i have really enjoyed it i even added on a few months more and enough virtual currency for an additional firearm i was curious about i haven been counting but my guess is live paid around fifty or so and already have about one hundred hours of game play not to mention i have multiple months left on my current subscription with the experience this game gives you i feel like that is money well spent not the biggest bangor buck comp comp but definitely worth it no its not going to provide the consistent action of doom or serious sam you spend time tracking luring and stalking animals that respond to the scent with wind auditory and visual cues that you provide can you spend three hours tracking a bear that you never see because it can hear you before you pick up on its tracks yes can you spend two hours luring turkeys before you find one that fits your mission objective yes are there missions where you re supposed to just spot some tracks you betcha is it worth it i think so live never been out hunting in the real world so i cannot attest to the accuracy but i do enjoy the experience this game provides as well as the patience it teaches me
early access review the exact sort of game i was hoping hearthstone would be as my play time indicates in somewhat into this game and it doesn't even include mobile time while it doesn't have as much depth interaction as magic as if any game even comes close the mechanics it chose to remove ended up being a very smart move for a digital game removing the excessive places to cast spells makes this game play so smoothly and the mechanics of this game finally embrace the digital platform in ways other games failed graveyard mechanics cards that remember their buffs even when put back in the deck not having to reveal your entire hand when your opponent is looking for only units to discard with a very generous reward system in place this game is very worth trying out you just gotta survive the overly long tutorial
its a nice game but the controls if you play with a mouse is a buggy nightmare plus there a lot of complaints about the corrupt saved files you want to play this game install blue stacks and play it at its full potential without those problems steam version is garbage
i really wanted to like this game and i enjoyed a number of elements to it but there is a lot of inconsistency between within content combat for example is good not great on quests in the wasteland but is an absolute dumpster fire in your base any time anything attacks your shelter it is just such a nuisance and it happens a lot i love the fallout franchise and art style but for me this game ended up as a hard pass
early access review do recommend this game it is a lot of fun i have played adventure quest worlds adventure quest worlds for more then five years i loved that game it was five thousand and ten now this game i give two thousand and ten because it didst have all the stuff that adventure quest worlds did if this game aqua three dimensional gets exactly like adventure quest worlds just that it is three dimensional then i think this game could be one of the most famous games of all time but of course it is still in a early access so it int done yet but i think it never will if it becomes like adventure quest worlds there is some stuff that has to be better tho sometimes i get out of the map if i walk against the wall or up a hill but only sometimes now very often tho but a got to be careful however the game is super fun it is kinda boring at the start of the game because i didst understand much what to do and stuff but now i have played this for like twenty hand in lvi eight it took a long time for me to understand what i could do to lvi up faster and where to go to get better weapons than the ones i got from the story mode so done do the same mistake and the graphics is good for a role playing game game it is supposed to look like this and i have set my settings to highest and i got thirty first person shooter all the time almost all the time i get forty first person shooter sometimes but not very often so if a like role playing game games and a loved adventure quest worlds then a should try this out it is a lot of fun but there int many classes yet only four as far i know warrior mage rogue and guardian but i strongly recommend this game and bow playing this with friends is one million times better thirty three
amazing addition to the bad games its even better than the mobile and flash version i think that they may have made it to overpowered with the weekly competition i have every tower and blood decal and i have been playing for like four weeks the competition is a very easy way to get medallions may
early access review this game was awesome when it came out i mean its just another battle royal game but it was refreshing something that want pub or fortnight they went and took out classes made chickens faster than us in bolt and took away duos would not recommend fix your game
good game very much like min craft with better graphics you done need a great computer to play on high ultra settings the only downfall is it gets pretty boring playing alone or once you've established a base with friends and like all free to play games you have to pay for things to spice up the game but the game is still very playable without spending money
this is one of the best games i have ever played if you love time consuming games that are methodical this is for you if you like games with goals this is for you if you like resource management games this is for you it takes a lot of time i mean a lot there are so voodoo many achievements some hidden some not to get and each new run of the game is different i love idle games and this is probably the best one out there especially for the price its free try it out nothing to lose
early access review started off as a great game then the patches games this patches the game breaking patches that destroyed what made the game great and popular now its mostly dead
early access review only recently got a personal computer that could run games decently without overheating like a mother i was in the market for a good first person shooter with decent game play now i know team fortress two is out but i wanted something a bit more like cod which i found with this game to say its a free to play game its amazingly good nothing like i expected connection seems to be stable for the most part the modes are all very enjoyable more so when we figured out we had to shoot the objective not stand next to them like in cod cod noon and the guns are fairly well balanced i might only have two hours on record but i can normally get a feel on whether or not ill enjoy a game within forty minutes glad to say i most certainly feel that way about this give it a go you might as well since its free and honestly its a better first person shooter game than the recent full price ones
war thunder is a great game and the potential it has i amazing i mainly play the non steam version one thousand hours unfortunately the developers are absolutely terrible and some of the greed est people live ever seen all they ever try and do is make the game less playable unless you buy premium vehicles currency account time it center their work has continuously gotten worse over the years see the current state of naval forces helicopter damage models and the same game play in air re since the game was released then when the community complains about the way the deus are acting they openly mock and censor us done even download the game unless the developers change how they are acting
early access review old adventure quest worlds on the internet one thousand and ten but this game no effort at all i can see what they were trying to create but this is pure trash go play run escape or something other than this
early access review one of the best cogs online atm good dose of strategy and me as a good start if you are coming from something like mtg game is very generous with card packs in the beginning and relatively easy to build a decent collection highly recommend
early access review well in short the game is pretty meh it has some cool ideas but messes it up by not having good fundamentals they increased the variance which was already the main drawback of games like magic the gathering to such an extent that most games are simply decided by ragtop decking some cards are also kinda like that that they can win the game in a turn if the opponent doesn't have the exact right answer at that one turn being mana flooded for a few turns is pretty common its almost impossible to avoid with a dec size of seventy five statistically speaking so yeah all these factors lead me to believe that the creates fundamentally done understand the basic mechanics and more importantly mathematics of card games or they just wanted to make an ultra casual mtg clone which is hard since mtg is already pretty casual in some ways
early access review just played my first game already very cool and nostalgic game play from old cod games this game already has content that took rival royal games a year at least to implement i hope to see good updates and a good player base for this game would highly recommend
early access review solid game though i would recommend staying away from ranked matches as they can match you against players with lag so bad they teleport stick to games with friends for maximum enjoyment
this game is really fun to play with friends i am not a fan of some of the female designs in it but with most the skins later fix the issues they make it easy to earn gems and honor to get new heroes and the class and play style are expansive i used to play league and this game seems to lack a lot of the toxicity thus far in players i have yet to run across the chat spamming you see in of and league
early access review this game is weird you stand if front of a guy with machine gun you hit him like fifteen times than he shoots you once and you re dead view is a bit odd too far and swings like a drunk guy you open a door or window but it want to open in your direction so it cant its so de that it makes you want to quit uninstall cd four typical experience you run for fifteen min equip everything see no one than you are dead you see no one what killed you five it lag sit has potential it could be good if those things are fixed changed
this game is pretty fun there are moments where you re part of this huge battle involving hundreds of people where there are airships techs tanks all just trying to take a small point on a huge map then there are moments where you and a small squad of friends or people go in sneaky becky like and take a point from under their noses my only qualms are that living and unlocking things can be a bit of a grind but that about it there always something going on and you can just air drop in the middle of the action so you done have to drive a half hour to get somewhere unless you want to because that can be pretty fun too all in all this is pretty fun nine hundred and ten would drive around again
early access review this game is awesome i love everything about plays far better than pub and its free and no micro transactions like footnote there no reason you shouldn't give this game a try
really good free to play game the only thing you can buy here are skins takes skill to play of look are good it runs on my potato intel he graphics a lot of sport events you can join overall i recommend it if you like fighting games a
early access review they apparently removed it but eternal had spyware called red shell on it that tracks your activities outside the game i would not trust them its likely they'll integrate it back in because they were very defensive about using it
all the negative reviews have like no time on this game laugh out loud my time int impressive but that because i played on mobile for a while they say this is pay to win that complete bullshit you just have to know the games towers and figuring out good combos people say there so many hackers yet i have played three hundred games without a single hacker so what gives why do people say this because there mad they lost fair and square
graphics advanced min craft its amazing tho i have always those moments where the game freezes for like half a second and it gets annoying like twelve times per minute no creator creative mode dah eck at least let the player on own server world do whatever they want update seems there is creative mode but only through the bucks downloadable content pack update twenty no creative mode in downloadable content say cd
early access review had such high hopes for this game but these developers are utterly incompetent greedy a that done care about your gaming experience i done think live ever witnessed them fix anything in this game rather any issue persists as long as it takes for them to completely replace it with something else usually worse really live tried i cant think of any the building aspect was amazing when i started playing about two years ago it actually mattered where you put your blocks and how well you protected your pilot seat the ability to actually engineer a robot is now virtually nonexistent without any kind of pilot sea control module game play used to be a competitive and rewarding team play experience now that you get auto heals and auto lock missiles there no incentive for anyone to protect heal or support anyone else they've nerved any competitive aspect over and over to the point where pretty much whoever arrives or fires first will probably win if you re down a teammate which happens a loot as there is no way to reconnect to a match you pretty much have no control over how screwed you are it make your head hurt trying to understand all the ways they've accidentally succeeded in disallowing me to play with my brothers alienating their users and going against their own core concepts i really done know how to condense the book that i can write about all the good and bad in this game but as the good seems to be gone and the bad is now worse ill just highlight a couple things that have either amused or ticked me off over the years there was a rectifier that would pulse energy to flip you over if you ended up on your back it was pretty cool this was taken away and we were given a ten second auto flip that lifts you up into the air and surrounds you in a swirly light that like a billboard for the enemy team instead of knowing my own robot for how i built it and using my rectifiers as a tool i now avoid ending up on my back only because of this new punishment they've forced on all of us or just let it go as a death if i do this was maybe one of my favourite items in game but in sure simple players were complaining about them being shot off duh protect them or not working correctly after your robot is half destroyed duh place them better this is a prime example of how they cater to the lowest common denomination of lazy unskilled players and then needlessly take from the rest of us to keep things in line with their idea of fair at one point they implemented multiple servers to be able to handle more users but rather than letting each one handle users as it filled up they simply divided up all the players equally amongst the servers guess what each server was starved for users and queue times instantly went up from only a few seconds to regularly over a half hour to an hour just to play a single match this persisted for the better part of a year meanwhile they seemed entirely clueless or unwilling to fix what they caused while regurgitating over and over that they just needed more players then as it was finally getting better they did it again it just goes to show whether they understood their mistake or not they done care what you have to go through seriously from just a couple of seconds it was incredible to over thirty minutes on average for over a year and they did nothing there is this beep that lets you know when a platoon member is ready to battle it seemed to work until after a patch then once the beep started it didst stop it was useful at first but then just frustrating and they never fixed it each garage got a a bonus for the first win of the day they moved the a to the garage icon and to the outer edge of the garage floor but it also never went away it was useful at first but then just frustrating and they never fixed it yet more issues that persisted for a year or so before just being removed entirely yep that right no a bonus anymore because linking a graphic to a script was way to big of a job for them to handle and wouldn't directly make them any money this game has made me want to swear off early access games but given that free am expects you will pay two thousand and forty for one crappy robot and then shows no concern for any issues you might have i really think its just the people working on it that are the problem i cant be mad at rob craft it used to be amazing but the developers have ruined it to a point that i find unplayable in more sad for the game like when you see a smart kid unable to shine under an obliviously ignorant parent their vision seems to have gone from building an awesome game that nobody else have to blatantly copying other games in the hopes it will magically make them money i mean loot crates seriously it might not be so bad if they haunt also at the same time taken away the in game currency that i paid for but its still pretty bad because i have no need for anything the crates give me screw you jerks i want my money back of and megabits in so you have no idea how many hours live spent building my mega and now they re just gone in really looking forward to hearing your reason for this one free am because all the problems you remove rather than fix always seem to be your own fault in the first place these guys obviously cant manage their own code but in pretty confident that they cant write it either and that they are paying someone else to do it so we pay them to pay themselves to pay someone else to do their work and that someone else for sure cares less about us players than free am does to be completely fair every time they take something away from me pretty much every patch i try to look at it like a whole new game so then the game int as great as it was but is still a pretty good game in itself at that point then its just good then just okay then disappointing then more disappointing now its just bad
early access review this has installed some bullshit on my computer that even after uninstalling is still running id go as far as say it might be malware stay clear of this pub rip off
early access review valhalla is a great game i have been playing on and off since release and i have loved every minute of it there is such a depth and a variety of mechanics and strategy that make a fighting game so exciting that i cant put it down for more than a week with constant updates from the big team and an incredibly active community i can safely say that this is the most fun and diverse fighting game out there game modes include fra brawl four players a rotating custom game of some sort and ranked both one versus one and two versus two there is also a training feature and an option to make a custom room for you and your friends each of the thirty four characters feel so unique be it the different equip able weapon combinations or the six unique signature moves each legend possesses i guarantee you'll find a hero that suits your play style among many others you've got a cowgirl a gangster think nineteen fifties mafia and a straight up dragon the lore is somewhat whimsical yet very detailed and the community is generally friendly and willing to give tips if you ask this game is still in open access and is entirely free to play the only thing you need real money to purchase are skins and taunts neither of which have any impact on the game play occasionally a new weapon or mechanic will be introduced and some members of the community will take it upon themselves to and moan about how unfair the new weapon is or how the new mechanic dash being the latest is going to ruin the game forever however whether you re a fighting game veteran or totally new to the scene you'll definitely find hours of enjoyment in brawl all old deep varied mechanics smooth control reliable server constantly updated active community lots of characters to choose from learning curve
i came no pun intended a a the a a for the plot and i am staying for the upgrades have spent many an hour playing this game some might say to many in fact i just gave it up a few months ago after finally tiring the game play time well spent
game has its pros and cons for me its good i play it with friends mostly really addicting the only mob which made me to stay and play it recommendation to everyone who want to play
early access review this game is awesome if you are reading reviews to see if you should play you should i bought gems just to say thanks to the deus great game play generous ftp model very fun
early access review good game its just a huge time waster when it comes to getting coins a have to do some hardcore grinding to get anything done i would like it a lot if either they lower the prices on legends or a earned more coin when finishing a match
early access review very bad done like the game after i deleted it it keeps opening the game by itself when in using my computer even though i uninstalled the game please just stop opening fix this at once
of the the the of the the портануть the windows of the the a a the a the the a достаточно быстрые the симпотичный the the the of the удобное управление the the the the of the of хороших отзывов the the the a рекомендую of the опробывать of the the каждому the a of the a a the a
fun when you first play it gets to be an insufferable grind later on not so much fun as it was when i started playing it more fun with friends play with a world war two documentary on the side and learn all there is to learn about adolf the boys used to be eight hundred and ten
pro one of the best cards game easy to use and really good if its your first card game if you liked sky rim you will feel at home playing this game the story and the way they made the cinematic is really cool good online play pretty balance lots of good things you should at least try it considering that its free cons then it seems in wrong and you done have to pay to fully play the game i just didst paid enough attention to it as it seems conclusion try it
early access review really enjoy the game but it would be nice if there was a type of training mode where you could test out different classes and abilities otherwise its a great game and i think that it will only grow and improve from here on out
early access review runs better than pub has better graphics than pub funniest battle royal game on the market constant update jumping boot broken mrs download without hesitation
not a very good sim the venerable old fax is of far higher quality than this is in a former aircraft mechanic and veteran who worked on some of these planes i know pretty much everything about them so yes i know exactly what in talking about as an expert in the field furthermore the company behind this game often engages in unethical business practices raising and lowering prices in an attempt to make more money off each sale by making the sales appear bigger than they actually are for example an aircraft that has been listed for years at a nine hundred and ninety nine price has been jacked up to one thousand four hundred and ninety nine on this and previous summer or winter sales only to return to the normal price a month or two after the sale ends other games by other russian developers have also engaged in this tactic i do not mind supporting developers but for them to engage in unethical behavior in order to siphon money from the player base is wrong also they use the controversial star force spyware on all of their downloadable content this has been known to damage computer systems in the past i have two damaged did drives as proof that were killed by star force that was on the cycling manger three game all those years ago but not only is it very intrusive software but it is also spyware something that i didst think that valve would ever allow on steam game is not recommended due to its lack of realism unsavoury business practices by the developer and inclusion of spyware in downloadable content content
i love how this game assumes i haven been playing yugo since two thousand and two its fun i mean its duel monsters offs i just with there was an option to skip the godforsaken tutorial i just want to duel not sit here for an hour to pretend to learn the ropes of a game i mastered over a decade ago i downloaded this because nobody near me plays
early access review could be that in just bad at the game but its not fun for me as a new player the grind feels worse than path of exile which is inherently not a bad thing ranked system needs too be looked at and the rewards
early access review this games provides a very good battle royal experience and you can choose between classes and various spells i will surely recommend this game the movement mechanics are just crisp and the time i played this game it was worth every second truly enjoyable and nice experience
i truly wanted to like this game and invested time and money to purchase the car and track bundles the game is fun when the servers are working and you done get hit with the dreaded five hundred and three server error that keeps you from logging in to play whats worse is if you purchased any of the atm or adam experience a dons only to find out they are also unavailable when the server is out i suggest looking into asset to cora project cars or even racing considering its designed online only and much more consistent in providing a fulfilling experience thread carefully
i can only recommend this if you enjoy facing the same decks over and over again all you really see people run is caber angels ancient gears tea burn ill weevil burn ill red eyes zombies or the occasional grandpas cards tomfoolery it is dull repetitive and a waste of time this went from a legitimately decent yugo game to a cesspool of cash grabbing because any new players better invest money into this game if you want to even have a chance in player versus player there are better yugo games stay away from this one
one of the most idiotic card systems in steam enemy random always hits a warded creature draw dependant loose one hundred times to la up game just frustrating as hell was hoping for more strategy involved game instead you get buy a in bundle and try winning again but even that wont guarantee you a victory us enemy got of low cost card with high powers and just owning you from right to left and bow since enemy cards are closed you can really see that its not so random as it should be and that only a first god dam campaign pathetic
the game itself is awesome the traffic is good the animals behave like animals and even the weather is nicely done the game play is good and all such stuff i would love to recommend it but as free player you can only run across the map and watch you are only allowed to shot two species and they are so rare that you will almost never find pm you cant host your own games so that you can hunt with a friend and if you join some random game nobody can guarantee that you are welcome
early access review the games addicting that legit the only thing you need to know if you are going to play this game expect to get a bit addicted its hard not to enjoy this game not be excited to see new features or ships or practically anything because your mind is constantly captivated to what can be done with the game for alpha nice i read a couple of reviews before i decided to write one but i did notice someone mentioning they couldn't join servers they were not given a reason why done join almost full servers join a empty one it will fill up easily
everyone of all dislike the she out that of trove game all i said i sucked did for hobby and mrs in the game main a fool out a me to it int gay sucking did even says in the bible suck thy did man i miss back in prison all we used to share each that as know a mean i int gay but i would suck a niggas did if all keep talk in to me like that promise dawn all gonna get your did sucked emma put it in the bowl of salad and toss it around and suck that did look all can call me gay much as all want but all know a on get to as beat and toes sucked cut i done play dat she if i int gay i int gay
early access review a lot of fun and very addictive not been playing very long but is very easy to get sucked in i was at first leary about the graphics as it is very mine craft type but the map is huge and the possibility are endless and i find more and more neat things every day bought pro already addictive
was so hyped for this game after seeing the reveal cinematic i honestly thought that it was going to be a free to play final fantasy online clone what i got was a twenty worth of in disappointment
product received for free early access review used to have progression and you would need to grind but you earned items now its system is black ops three and is more confusing and stupid instead of weapons and things having levels they have names and you need to check each individual item if its the better or worse version and i spent hours upon hours grinding to get heavily armoured cubes and somewhat good weapons well the game threw me the finger and i done think they re switching it back and even if they do i done think my armoured cubes will come back as far as i can tell this game is now trash and until further updates this game is trash
things i gave amount of brawl all gave me autism different types of lung cancer she male that i did not in want dopamine who i also did not and still do not want
early access review download the game install the game run the game four got a in sync error fix it six got a under maintenance error play it tomorrow got an in sync error again fix it with another tips got an same in error done play this game because the development wont to solve the problem
early access review this is a very pretty game but i cannot in good faith recommend it there are a lot of crafting options things flow more or less understandably with the recipes being unlocked as you build things not a huge fan of that but it helps you understand the game so in alright with it visually its very nice but the problem is the combat system monsters have a much larger range than you and there are no effective ranged weapons so i was forced to dash through enemies there is no collision damage the one small mercy here while swinging and hoping i hit didst always because sometimes i would inexplicably fail to swing my sword for several seconds and then swipe at empty air and with limited stamina every battle against an enemy that actually fights back and all but three or four of them do is a dice roll whether you'll be able to win before your dash meter bottoms out and you re murder zed by a tiny evil piglet there no other tactic that seems to work even circle strafing as mobs seem to be able to hit you from any angle and any elevation they re easily able to follow wherever you go unless you outpace them or have a door to shut in their face and some are small enough to slip through one times one gaps and terrorize you there a severe disparity between monster health and damage output for the early game in not sure how it is in late game because i gave up after progressing to the obsidian tier and that was enough of a problem as it was requiring the consultation of a wiki to find the best places and ways to kill things and not die repeatedly its a shame the combat is so awful because the rest of the game is really quite well done there are ladders with auto snap teleworkers really nice looking decorations you keep everything in your action bar when you die just not your inventory the crafting system int grid based so it doesn't feel like a direct rip of min craft all these are nice things but ultimately in order to progress beyond the very basic levels of interaction with the world you have to kill things and that where the game fails and fails terribly i wanted to like this i really did but in not going to suffer through this horrible combat system any longer
i got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money and i have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase over fort six hundreds hours over a span of five years live played this game and watched it grow add new things i was there from the hapless update april fourteen twenty elevens up to the twenty sixteen miss as update the game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decisions i want very fond of if its something valve are masters on it is to build a game that all about the game play its by their flawless designs that their games like left four dead counterstrike and team fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day despite some of them being decades old looking at team fortress two it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games especially when twenty sixteen saw a surge of other class based arena shooters like over watch and battle borne hama i will say i played over watch for about a year it was the christmas of twenty sixteen when i first got over watch and at the start i enjoyed it but over the year i played it the sessions when i played it grew further and further a part until i only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didst touch the game it was then i really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game how it had been polished to perfection something as simple as the load outs simple change of weapons could completely alter the play style of characters in this game swap the engineers wrench out for a gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the offensive rather than defensive the medics main weapon syringe gun is blu sauger changes whether hes a battle medic or not the syringe gun allows you a passive health regent of he but blu sauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regent by three points making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regent after escaping close encounters that only two examples of ways classes can change depending on their load out every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their load out in games like over watch your hero has counters meaning you cant master a class to the point where you re unbeatable because hes been designed around a rock processors design to where some hero can take you out in this game it was just about picking a class selecting a load out that suits your play style and going to town there was very little counters each class could take out the other equal so long as you played it right with one class exception the community also helped make this game great by offering custom game modes custom maps custom servers it was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it allowed the community to create and take part in it something over watch doesn't allow past letting them design skins what has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that i feel it has lost its way many of the people i used to play with have moved on and the community int the same as it once was the community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are min craft servers with ads out the as to try and cash in and revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favourite game that not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community the development team has plenty to do in it as well trying to make the weapons balanced the team went back and fourth with a lot of the weapons in the game improving some that were before worthless like the quick fix and but turning some before good weapons bad the problem is that when listening to a community you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt keep in mind its not the people using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced its the people getting killed by them that complaining much like how cod nerved its shotguns down to being useless the game killed a lot of good weapons and ruined some peoples load out but it want also load out changes adding things like competitive play to the game i still feel was one of the worst decisions ever the games random cries system is there for a reason its there as a boost of luck so that even if you re better than everyone else you might have a critical rocket strike you or a critical heavy or scout which you would be otherwise escaped from or defeated could you imagine if counter strike go had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg it count as a crit and kill the person the community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and inst kill the person they were shooting at i no longer play team fortress two because the state its in is not one i like i have played it a bit in recent times but that was doing tour of duty with some friends as mann is machine is a game mode i still enjoy but even if i no longer play it i will never forget the friends i made through it i wont forget the trading i did through it i wont forget the fun times i had on it fort six hundreds hours amounting to more than half a year some would call that a waste but i wouldn't have traded those hours for anything thank you for the memories team fortress two April
early access review was ruined when they screwed around with tiers no idea what it is now but i can tell from all the loot box crap that the deus probably a rent fixing things and simply are sugar coating the game i mean its free to play so give it a shot but from coming from alpha to now the game has certainly gone down hill due to that i cant recommend this but try if you must
two thousand and seventeen greats games but to much cash shop needed for get great stats stupid system of stamina never removed its that reason they have only player ingate now you can create twelve char account but four by day greats choice class if you are poverty like me you really will not like to play because of the shop but i dislike again this game only because the stamina system if you done like player versus player done play after have not stamina you can only play in player versus player cant create only char account or hours by day before out of stamina player versus player unbalanced and its game its pay to win
feels and plays like an old game combat feels weird and auto path is even weirder performances are pretty bad even on high end machines game map is huge but the world feels so empty and dull cant believe people really paid to enter a and beta test this game plenty of better massively multiplayer online role playing game out there this is below average at best
i highly recommend this game for its high quality graphics and incredible game play its storyline was so strong that even after twenty minutes i was on the ground crying i would pm
updated as of twenty five november everything below still stands true and is still an excellent game id like to spend a few moments on explaining the business model of this free to play title old the business model of this free to play is solid you can acquire anything no cosmetic in the game by playing it but by spending a few bucks you can increase the rate at which you can acquire the things you want first of id like to say that you can access all no cosmetic items in the game without spending any real world currency by simply playing the game as you are playing the game you get experience points from doing pretty much anything relevant in the game and for every up you acquire one certification point these certs are the primary currency in the game which you will spend on anything that interest you except cosmetics that can only be bought with real money however we are now going to look at the things in the business model that are imperfect compared to a completely fair free to play title while a lot of the upgrades and things that impact your game play are only possible to acquire through certs certain things can be alternatively bought by spending real money such as weapons weapon scopes and possibly the soon to be implemented implants also you can purchase experience boosters using only real money that will for a limited time increase the amount of experience you gain while playing the game lastly there is the ability to pay a monthly subscription to the game similar to conventional massively multiplayer online titles and this will cause you to receive an experience boost as well among other things that been said the starting equipment is all competitive even in some cases regarded by many to be the best in slot for the experienced players as well november
yeah so fallout shelter when it came out on mobiles i played it i played it so frigging much addicting as hell to have the most perfect vault ever although my samsung galaxy season five handled the game well once you had a big vault and all that the game got saggy and also strained your phone i uninstalled it right away once i heard about the personal computer version no more phones heating like a cooking pot no more saggy playing with big vaults i always knew somehow this game ended up on steam and i waited for the steam version until i started playing again so what it is the most fun and simple building simulator and the best part is the fallout theme it has a lot of content but you will grind like hell micromanage and wait i mostly do some stuff on my personal computer like editing photos and such this game runs on the background and keeps going automatically until something needs to be done or handy best part of the new features are the wasteland quests and exploring some buildings in wasteland its fun for first thirty five weeks but you can get bored overall this game is probably one of the best mobile games ever created you can do just fine without paying for the starter packages and all that but who cares i threw five euros for the starter package not a big deal a must play for any fallout fan
product received for free early access review recommend it free to play pub right here boys but today when i launched every single time it kicks me out of the game or the game crashes but i get solid one hundred first person shooter on standard standard and realistic i done know is it to my personal computer or the game it freezes me when i choose the place where i want to spawn help if you know the solution
early access review got this game during a free weekend i must say i am very happy of course it was free despite getting it free i believe that this game is worth the ten dollar price point despite it being early access the alpha build shows itself but the game play thus far is solid and fun you can unlock more ships as you go by achieving kills wins and captures you do not have to buy anything in game from the looks of things in the store its skins and five experience boost and i think there is one premium ship that can be bought but i done know if you have to later unlock it
amazing this game is scary in a way that will make you laugh it yourself try to just when the music changes most of the time its better not to look back to see what you re running from then suddenly gets spooked by a cute cardboard ghost no spoilers check the game yourself its free and you can basically run it on anything even a potato which make me think the recommended specs was a prank its self
early access review started out liking this game the more you play the more you understand that the game is very shallow all these ranked decks are similar lets all play the same cards of look another stranger deck lame too add to that its a very dumped down version of magic the gathering or should i say a replica of hearthstone
could not make the interface work i could not find the proper aspect ratio this sim has a long way to go to compete with other nice flight sims like falcon bus and others and starting in the frog foot is not where i would start just say in
a decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small rather hostile player base with limited variety good game play overall is really good the ships are slow and require some patience they are supposed to be big hulking capital ships the combat is pretty good as well bad variety two modes conquest and frontline conquest has two lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes frontline is basically the same thing but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic so you have two modes that both have the same similar mechanics and objectives if you done like one mode you wont like the other ships stealth some ships have stealth which in and of itself int a bad thing the problem is that they drag the game down and are just a fun to play against games like defense of the ancients two do stealth right where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves which this game has but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes which this game doesn't have so if the enemy team drafts a team you cant switch ships mid match and you cant see what the enemy is bringing and you done have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill you are sol double or triple the frustration when compared to defense of the ancients two because you also have a three dimensional space your steal the enemy could be its just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you cant see the enemy draft but no option to counter if you done draft one of those few counter ships yourself sound game audio is mediocre ship fire sounds rather lacklustre player base its no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players the problem is that in the few recent player versus player matches live played people are rather hostile that might not be an issue if the game had a decent player base but if you run into someone you done like be prepared to see them in the next twenty matches because odds are you'll fight them again and again beyond that finding a match for me has taken everything between one minute and ten grind unlocking ships doesn't seem so bad but i also bought into the games early access and so had a lot of credits stored up however ships range between a credits and mil credits while you earn about a each match it just feels like too much of a grind for me and that before you buy the side grades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have menu org i hate the menu system in here such a pain to visit the hanger and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it there are some filters but they done help as much as you think overall the venues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming overall the game play is good but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions
early access review of my goober live played the adventure quest games since i was younger and i loved pm to bits now teleport have a three dimensional game that i can play on my phone that amazing get this game now
early access review if you casually enjoy being spawn killed and put in unfair positions your team simply cannot win then this sir madam this the game for you welcome to pay two win online edit one march fifth two thousand and sixteen game is still a massive pos with absolutely no balance edit two march twelve two thousand and sixteen sniper rifles are practically instant kill also rearming costs for ammunition is absolutely ridiculously and inhibits any form of progression edit three sky heart is a massive scrub this is for you buddy March
early access review an excellent mix of hearthstone and mtg if you getting tired of hearthstone randomness or want something similar to mtg without the insane cost definitely check out eternal the free to play rewards are very generous
game is still buggy and optimized constant frame rate drops when playing on normal settings go play min craft at least you can choose which version you want and mod it out to your liking
early access review one of my favourite games hands down the developers particularly are really excellent and do not try and nickel and dime their players into some pay two win scheme i appreciated that so much i actually did end up purchasing packs even still before then i had a good number of cards from playing and did not feel overly restricted matchmaking is very quick and the multiple modes and events keep it interesting
i know how many hours i have on steam currently but ignore it because i have been playing sense one beta and i have quite some experience with this game and i can proudly say that i recommend it not even joking i all ready have about twenty skins just by not paying a cent because in a casual scrub and its awesome
there are a lot to say about data defenders of the ancients its a remake of the old data mod for war craft actually i could say that the transition from dorado a two game play was amazing they didst forgot a single thing and added even more than original data the game got amazingly cool graphics and a great soundtrack the menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players valve really cares about your learning in defense of the ancients two so they've made a learning page where they teach you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items data two have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each her because data one didst had that options you need to now by your experience what to buy they have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does if you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more professional player to teach you its called coach he will spectate your game and make you tips the game play is amazing love it because its very realistic and logic data two got a lot of logic instead mobs like laugh out loud done have the art of heroes are sorry but ill repeat it are amazing everything is amazing in data almost a still data got some problems that need to be corrected st the community data two community is full of stupid foolish kids who done know how to play and done even learn how to play and when you say them done feed or other item they'll always say to you fun you mobile fun your mother typical answer of russian twelve to kids some updates that done needed to be done like removing the judge fountain hook because it had a lot of logic and they removed it but never mind to this i cant tell you if defense of the ancients two still got many bugs or not but i notice that they still have a few like shop bug where you cant buy items servers i done know why but its normal to have the servers down in dot and sometimes in the game will appear searching for defense of the ancients two network ont know why this happens but probably their servers cant hold so much people my opinion so yeah that pretty what live wrote i hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do good luck have fun
after playing this game over the course of three seasons on the smite launcher and steam version my feelings for this mob are extremely mixed considering at this point i only play once every few weeks that should indicate my lasting appeal towards smite although the game and its content such as the gods game modes and other aspects are great hire poorly maintains and executes fixes and patches to the game hire has trickled down from a respectable corporation to a greedy monopolizing entity that only focuses on new ways to attract new players not by improving the servers or balancing but adding additional cosmetics and other useless cash grab elements they claim as if they actually care about catering to the communities needs in terms of balancing items and gods fixing bugs and reducing crashes but the only results we are given involve a more unstable foundation and skins hell at least give skins to different gods besides the same pool of gods they seem to fancy most for instance it took years for havana to receive a new skin which was later removed due to copyright after a few months they decide to literally recycle the skin and just change the color scheme effects and up to avoid more copyright issues in completely aware that some people are fine with the current changes and that fine all in saying is hire needs to step their game up and stop trying to divide their company on so many different projects which is probably one of the main issues they a rent giving smite enough light of day and attention and only make light hearted pledges to redd tors just to keep them calm and reduce the pressure on themselves overall id give this mob a five hundred and ten in its current conditions if hire actually starts to fix year old bugs and balance items gods more fairly and effectively it could potentially reach an eight hundred and ten or better
world of tanks blitzes at its core nothing more than a grind arena shooter you re pitted against each other in team deathwatch and capture the base modes both modes active at the same time by doing battle you earn experience and credits with your earned rewards you upgrade your current tank or you purchase a new tank but how does it play the general game play is solid and didst show any real bugs the main issue that live got with this game is the extreme grind factor and the very clear go premium to enjoy setting done get me wrong you done have to go premium to enjoy the game but it sure takes away the grind or as a brit states with premium you would have to grind maybe a few hours less then without premium but still you have to spend numerous hours and battles grinding did i enjoy it yes i did for the first couple of rounds until i noticed that there no real nation filter when it comes down what model of tank battles the other besides of that the first few times things are not always as clear when it comes down to what upgrade to buy or not is this a stayer not for me i like the different tank battles but it nothing new therese better tank games out there even more tactical ones but its basically free and that somewhat of a nice thing still i done really see myself getting back into this game if they done add some sort of single player coop campaign mode which they probably wont due to the fact that everything is geared towards player versus player clashes
really wanted to give bless online a try for a long time but the negativity surrounding it always stopped me before i hit the install button so far i have played bless online for twenty two hours granted not a lot to judge a massively multiplayer online role playing game and see all that it offers but i honestly enjoyed myself most asian mos have art style that turns me off immediately but bless seems like it nailed that perfectly coupled with its excellent music it really helps me immerse myself in the world its true that player count doesn't seem that great but the game play is very good and entertaining to me at least the combat system is drastically different than any morphs live played and its more action oriented than most it takes a little getting used to and changing key binds to suit your style there are some inconveniences here and there like how am i constantly spammed by the game that who creates what that doesn't seem to be the slightest concern to me and i couldn't find the option to turn it off but still that didst stop me enjoying the game yet the game looks gorgeous for a do game it requires to be on sad and even then occasionally have noticeable drops but it didst bother me that much since every massively multiplayer online i played has that from world of war craft to elder scrolls online you have occasions that you have massive performance drops the business model seems fair too maybe i didst look at everything but so far i couldn't see items in their shop that gives massive advantage you get to tame your mounts and pets which was a really refreshing feature to me i get it the game has flaws but in having a blast and i hope the deus and be wiz which i hear they call the graveyard of mos done abandon it it has great potential
i am a sim racer since the good old a revs since that year i drove nearly every race sim on the market to make it short race room experience is definitely the one available its the feeling of the game no other race game has such a good force feedback and sound the artificial intelligence is very good maybe other title have better graphics project cars but this one just feels great racing are is such a great experience after a race with a good force feedback wheel like cow two you are completely done its so heavy to feel the road and the opponents and hear the best racing sound on the market give it a try even with the free version you can have a lot of fun their is so many high quality content available that every race sim fan is happy my personal favourites are atm one thousand nine hundred and ninety two group a cars and brands hatch and salzburg ring
if you've ever played combat flight sims back in the a golden era as i did the dream of a fully immersive good looking and complex simulation has come true what a time to be alive
with perm death in this game it makes it a whole lot challenging you must try to avoid dangerous shots at all times to prevent your character from dying as your character levels and progresses they will also find stronger equipment to take on stronger enemies if you re careless you will die the feature of stat pots and pets can change everything plus it is an massively multiplayer online role playing game so that means you can work together with others to kill baddies i also like how its in sprite art and there also tons of classes for you to play around with their unique abilities
crashed five times this morning fun for a free game and stressful if you like your gear keep away from people if you want live that crashing problem tho my friend crashed a couple a times to and has quit playing since go get mistreated
early access review this game is fun and addicting and has great fighting systems and a great premise if you are a smash fan this is the game for you in some ways it is better than smash
live put more time into planes side two than all my other steam games and after this last update it just made me fed up with the game ultra long wait times for updates to come out just to see the game go down hill i kept trying to be excited for each update but then be disappointed with half baked crap and nerds i used to love the game when i first started playing but then the updates and increasingly stale game play just ruined it
really fun game until you reach max level sixty then when you queue up for dungeons your gear score is too low so the game forces you to spend money to buy better arm or using real money this is a pay to win game
i am fan of fallout and decided to try fallout shelter i was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was i am now hooked and have to check it every hour or so just to see what my little dwellers are up to the only negative is that to speed things along you need nuke colas and you can need quite a lot for some things
early access review so i have six hours of game play and i was declined for refund but there is pal with twenty hours of game play getting refunds they game is horrible and int complete absolute
well i flew all in the blue like the sky when you are high there you can slack until you get by a yak get shot out from the fleet delete real talk though some damn planes are over powered like the yak and the yak yak planes in general the spitfire has almost made me rage quit and break my eighty mouse the game needs a balance system maybe like a ranking system if i am flying a a and a messerschmidt comes out of no where then one taps my pilot that makes me off although the game is free it is alright but i cant recommend to anyone because of my experiences one thousand and ten would rage quit again

i hate this game for horrible renditions of us bombers that fall apart after twelve shots i hate the fact that they knowingly make russian vehicles vastly more powerful than others i hate this game for so many reasons but i cant argue with the hundreds of hours of fun i had playing it if you can put up with some serious annoyances you'll have a great time
the two free aircraft that you get are very fun to fly and decent to introduce the game to you this is a combat flight simulator with a command element to give the ground units more realism i highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in aviation or flying aircraft this game does have a slightly steep learning curve but that is countered by video tutorials available at the main menu of the game i highly recommend that you visit the developers website and download a copy of the checklist for the aircraft that you wish to fly then print it out and keep it handy or download it to a tablet the graphics are not bad for a flight simulator but are not cutting edge the multiplayer is not bad but depends on the server and its mission most multiplayer missions are community developed and not all aircraft are available in every mission their is also no in game void feature so downloading team speak is a must for voice communication all and all a good game but better if you pick it up during a sale
early access review if you think footnote has burnt to the ground this game is for you preferably play with a group of mates because they done do solo just yet but done let that change your mind its free so it wont hurt its great fun and has much creative ideas in which footnote should be taking notes update its about time streamers milk the game and bring the edgy footnote players over giving the game enough confidence and money to milk their game its gonna happen
a game that has stood the test of time and even if valve doesn't know how the game works cough bison cough that not a problem with the great community backing it new content being added regularly by the community for the community if you like a first person shooter with a cartoony feel yet still excessively violent as livers to decapitated heads fall from the sky then this game is for you there are nine selective classes each with strengths and weaknesses to enforce strategic team based combat but hey if you done like any of that you can dive into the economy and relish in the one thousand selection of hats to deck out your marc so people think you know what your doing
if you like ferries anime year old girls people being covered in mud loss fitted skirts and tops staying up until am playing games with the door shut looking at people in a lot of costume then this is the game for you and the whole family maybe not the whole family but you catch my drift play on a tablet to get the best peekaboo experience imaginable buy all the docs that come out almost everyday for only ninety nine cents wow now will you excuse me i need to restock my tissue supply have a good day playing this really weird game
it was alright for the first couple of years then the ajax came and replaced our beloved savior dry bear creating the super premium experience of loot boxes for most of the decent skins creating the super aegis and beads meta actives will be missed and smite is dead in terms of fun without friends at least at a higher level it is somewhat fun for a beginner but not really as people that played other mobs will probably pub stomp you in lower levels if the games not fun why bother reggie fils aim
early access review not ready for soft launch the deus are rubber banding back and forth and done seem to have a solid grasp of whats going on despite the opportunities they have proven time and again that they fail to understand their a audience as of six thousand eight hundred and eighteen the extended refund period seems to be over this wouldn't have affected my review but sure does impact my interest in checking the game out later do yourself a favor and wait a year or two if it continues on the current course the game will have collapsed well before then if they can get community and development staff that are abased they might be able to get back on track but right now that appears very unlikely the bless reps in the steam forums are largely useless and done have the answers that their customers are requesting
every once in a while foreigner will cave in to the russia only crybabies who swear up and down that not a single to is series or to was ever lost in combat so then in order to please people who do nothing but impulse buy all of their russian premiums this is likely where a fair chunk of their change comes from they do crap like this they glitch out the turret arm or on all their high tier soviet tanks grinding to face off against these death machines is a fun time in and of itself so that anything less than a top tier sabot round from a chieftains turbo laser of a main gun wont pen they fool around with the spelling mechanics and goof off with the crew durability i have seen soviet crew members make the ultimate sacrifice by stopping a sabot round from my japanese a and preventing it from killing the rest of the crew its absurd yes the game is beautiful and yes the models are high quality not many moving parts but ill take what i can get but this means nothing if you are only going to be seeing the same go pink death devices speeding around the map at breakneck speeds like the thirty something mile an hour is that every goober and his grandma has skilled out for meanwhile tanks like the re and the bulldog putter around at a speed that is so meh that you re just glad you a rent in anything else because anything else is guaranteed to be slow as dog do and not a match for the eastern bloc armoured battalion soviet border guards circa nineteen sixty ones that you are going to be facing off against the economy is once again in shambles tens of the exact same plane but with bigger gun wacky engines different paint job see pm series locke wolfe series yak elev meteors spitfires except for the griffon powered god flying christ machines zeroes force you to shell out big money just to progress there used to be folders that the aircraft would fit into and the research mechanic is just an exercise in how much punishment am i willing to endure today because if you done have premium then congratulations you re gonna die the balancing is nonexistent the russia boos and actual slav nike who are absolutely and i mean truly terrible at the game will complain about everything utah mesh doesn't cause ttttthhhaaaatttt much spelling its only like a single piece of metal that i can catch with my hand cause in super cool huh huh sloped arm or can block absolutely everything so the is should be completely until able from all angles huh church which the my main gun is like us the most powerful gun ever but i done really wanna face off against jag tigers and a patrons and tvs i kinda just wanna club tigers and a and they listen to these demands and then they give into them and guess what russia mains still suck they still get crapped on by the likes of bulldogs tigers baby centurions hell live even taken several out with my trusty a duster shoot the lowest part of the hull from the side it has no arm or and the complaining and screaming that comes with every kill is just mind numbing did the is get killed expect a torrent of vulgar statements ending with a paragraph did the is get a kill expect a smart used response in the chat about you should get good because the is is such a hard tank to use and all this gripe is about one tank that like i said any goober can shell out money for this is to say nothing of the is and four impenetrable super fortress the to meat on the table approach them from the front works every time and the to this thing totally saw extensive service in world war two but what about the super high tier to its poo poo because such ridiculous super weapons such as the met and khz exist i done know how they managed it why buy a slow man to when you can end the match as soon as it begins in a up the aircraft are a joy to fly but i feel as though another kick to the hues is incoming so who knows it needs work and for now emma have to give is a no for this recommendation and i have several thousand hours put into this game i only recently linked up my foreigner account with my steam one for streaming purposes is by the way the community is supportive and is willing to listen to advice and help out a friend but the few mods that actively post in game are just gigantic trolls who start arguments spam chat and ban people for asking them to stop so just done talk to anybody in the general chat period not like anybody does anyway they've all been banned seriously
early access review note pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indeed and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version twelve now for the review in not really a person who could judge what is considered cute i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you so in that regard i guess you could call them scary too i also like that it seems that the deus stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room like how they were in the indeed version i played but outside of those enemies the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing on top of that if its your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances what i mean is that unlike other horror games good ones that is there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the rules to win against said enemies are laid out take for example the first resident evil the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing whats in the room with you following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie a you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and a that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies well agile while using tank controls so evasion is a preferred option when you can that not to say that how the enemies appear in she is bad in fact the opposite the fact you done know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds its own easiness as you done know what the next room holds for you you have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker however this brings up an issue i have with the game there way too much luck involved ill give a good example the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out just run but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first catwalk room that what i call it at least the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions if you just dead sprint you have a five thousand and fifty chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in three hits there are other points like this as there an enemy i saw in mark pliers play through live yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong or right in my case as again i haven encountered the red face enemy in any of my play through so like i said this game takes a lot of luck if you re going to get far or just a lot of patience till you get that lucky run the other issue i have in not sure if its an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if its just how the game happened to be made the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room what i mean is that you cant just hold down the a key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room no in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you wont move and take damage till you remember to release the forward key and press it again like i said in not sure if its intentional or not if its not then i hope the deus will work on this as its basically a cheap beginners trap but other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and cant wait to see what the full release is like

data two is a first person shooter developed by bungee in nineteen ninety eights for the nintendo sixty four its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure similarly to the best game of the year one thousand and ten new york times gone home you play a young lesbian trying to find love however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieving your goal the obstacles are mostly stuns and expressions that every playable champ in the game has access to accept for suppressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low pro but that another story the game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colourful their language is when losing an massively multiplayer online role playing game data two is also an amazing language software on pare with rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages including but not limited too russian mexican spanish burrito burrito taco etc terra i would highly suggest this game to you and your friends despite it being so over priced at eight thousand nine hundred and ninety nine more it is worth every penny data two is also the only good video game to come out in the last twenty eight years and will stay that way for years to come and that how i spent my summer vacation ferris mueller
its a fun little game if you re into base management donating buy anything from it its all a ripoff cause on a free single player game paying for game play benefits fine what the hell its free and its single player no harm no foul except in this game you pay for the chance of getting something useful and believe me it wont be other than that its fine its fun its pretty and most importantly its free
early access review ann i really admire this game the graphic is really realistic and beautiful and the game it self is really fun and funny cd i highly recommend this game and thank you for creating this game who yeah it would be much better if a guys add night mode
its an okay game i like how it uses standard do character stats i done like how in level thirteen and still have level one pants no quest rewards no loot and not even a merchant nor do i like that in level thirteen and haven unlocked the ability to chat yet you have to complete five different quest chains in order to unlock chat which i understand is an anti spam thing but damn son that asking entirely too much of people overall twenty five would play but not recommend
early access review over all the changes this game is keep getting in harder and harder by in the stupid parts its impossible to go one round without in dining or getting lot of money do not get this game cause its a game that just makes a waste your money on stupid bundles and premium to make it easier i do not recommend this game its another scam to waste your money
this game really frustrates me i spent hours trying to get this she to work every time i tried joining a server it told me disconnected from server i tried everything from opening the launcher it self to lowering everything in the settings but it still doesn't let me play it if re downloading the game doesn't work then the review is staying like this
early access review overall i give a four hundred and fifty five or its a two dimensional platform fighting game no its not smash melee or four its actually sorta unique has lots of mechanics that do not exist in smash sex gravity cancelling edge sliding edge guarding is diff weapon system and chase dodging most characters are pretty unique in their own stats signature moves this game features amazing two versus two combos lots of strings lots of combos per character lots of combos per weapon still it obviously retains the fighting getting hit out of stage swing and i you can also play this game offline with friends at your house or something also there is a training mode which allows you to set a bot to reset in its original spot or he the more damaged they are the more they are knocked back back thus you have an excellent way to repeatedly practice combos alone you can play from a selection of fra one versus one experimental mode one versus one ranked two versus two ranked and custom games customization each character can be bought and levelled up levelling up until twenty on a character unlocks many different color choices for that character you can purchase skins they include the outfit two weapon skins you can mix and match color skins of your choice for each character its not entirely custom table but its good enough
yugo is still a fun game but kenai is just as as usual while this game is free to play without either putting in ungodly hours or paying ridiculous amounts of money its impossible to get past gold in player versus player it uses a what some complex card buying system where you purchase packs out of boxes so while there maybe a of a common and fifty different commons while only a of eight or the rarest cards in a box of two hundred packs you can only use three of any cards in a deck and most commons are useless so you could and often will as there almost always an or in the last packs have to buy five hundred commons or two hundred packs at thirty for thirty just to get one useful card also the ring is flat out the worst i have ever used in a game as a long time yugo i have had had bullshit draws in this that i simply could never get in real life its the same the over way i have had the perfect card after card and almost felt bad when playing online all that being said i done imagine ill stop playing but also will not forget how of a company kenai is and never pay for card buy one of their games again if you want to play this game seriously be prepared to either fork out either tons of cash or a major grind until you have useful spell rap cards mirror wall wall of disruption shetland one pet hate or two they use official rules but do not use the official ban list and if you find a card bug like i did next this not coming back from by after being sent there by hazy flame mantis or expect to be ignored and bug not fixed old good game as ever company and money grabbing tactics
its a really good game once you become invulnerable to rage quitting it for two or more weeks however i think it needs a bit of new stuff like could have more music less pay to win yes that it for now i done have much stuff to put in a
early access review love this game but i will still give the los and con pros one no health for your bot just play until your driver is killed cubes health but if your driver is unprotected you are toast two create whatever you want three no remade designed classes cons one no ability to start private matches two only one game mode for the people under mil robot rating or some high rating other than that this game is a must get
killed four plane engine rest after getting twenty my straight through it head back to base survive attempts by three people to shoot me down arrive at base accidentally land at too high of a speed break leg gears and crash few darth aero my
so far so good done know what to expect down the road but graphics are acceptable right now i could only hope the prices are reasonable as i have yet to purchase one that could be the killer again
early access review the game is decent and all all those people who says its better than hearthstone are probably casuals who done even know how to play hearthstone the game is good but not as decent or close to hearthstone that being said the tutorial is longer than the duration of all the times i had so combined which is sad laugh out loud but worth a try thou edit seven hours into a game tried multiple decks combination some are my own some are preset by the deus and this game is double penetrated in terms of balance of course some cards in other games are overpowered and broken but this whole game is based on that there are decks with a zero chance to win against its just that you have to get ready to press concede with dignity rather than watching your health drops thirty or something my review was to try this game but after trying to put time and experience into it nah i done think its playable like that sorry
early access review this is a very fun game to play with your friends or probably alone for me this game like super smash bros but i done have a wii a so i was upset then i saw this game at pax and got excited thanks for making this game
this game is cool to play fun but with friends i done recommend playing it solo gets bored after a while at least for me people say its pay to win but i wouldn't say so maybe in player versus player but ave is normal
early access review honestly i lasted ten hours its still a saggy glitchy mess with all kinds of balance problems i am astonished that the developers managed to mess up yet another release given all the issues its had the most concerning thing int even the little glitches its that it feels like an alpha at best this should never have been released in this kind of state the first second third laugh out loud it center time
early access review done ever write reviews but this game was absolutely trash during launch even when i managed to play it is a very mediocre game at best i tricked myself into believing this game was good just because i was really craving a new massively multiplayer online done be like me
walrus sums it up in a way i totally agree sadly live spent enough money to justify me staying for a little bit longer since i done want that investment to go to waste i wish it could've been better early impossible grind mostly the top two tiers four and five for both unlocking aircraft tanks and the aircraft tank modules forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account and even with a premium account tier five vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game this grind element adds a pay to win mechanic horribly cd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics for a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity its a bit odd to me that it doesn't even take history into account when creating matchup for the vehicles this in addition to the fact that gains system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchup so we now have a game that neither historical nor is it balanced dancing walrus
great game i am surprised by the quality that is is free my only complaint is the amount of game that is behind bars that you have to purchase like you buy the car then you must buy separate skins like whf
as a or who bought the legendary pack on the original war i keep coming back to this game for some in reason maybe in in stupid or maybe this game is in addictive despite its flaws try it and find out for yourself lao the player versus player is very exciting and the zombies are decent enough threat while piping so i guess its okay this was launched in two thousand and twelve so done expect top notch graphics its free now so who datum cares
making a video on this i played since beta invested over three hundred euros in hire they do not give a about community they killed off their own official forums in favor of geddit which is easily the most cancerous place on the internet they do not give a about community their support is useless slow automated its impossible to get a real human response you can get banned for nothing i got banned for nothing two times took me one month to resolve it and undo that three of my friends got perm banned for hacking which never happened and you can also receive death threats via their game and that is also of they do not care they do not give a about community matchmaking and ranked are de in ranked pro player can get matched with a first time player and with a bronze player low they do not give a about community most of the paid content is exclusive or behind an ring pay all they keep ruining the design of the site and game destroying some parts of its functionality whf they do not give a about your financial investment it took them over three years to implement step verification up until then it was enough to get your password and steal your account no confirmation is needed to change email good luck talking with automated answers via support they tolerated brandon for years and years even though hes the most toxic person imaginable and he was on their payroll even after he publicly shamed and flamed his own donator on twitch eventually he had to quit on his own each check other reviews each is do not install it ever since ten cent bought them they stopped progressing they only produce skins and other pay all content they do not care about you they do not care about the game
i love it love it love it i have a whispering death who lvi twenty and a deadly ladder who lvi eighteen there is so many cool features and it suits all my hated needs but i love dragons especially hated ones like toothless and that is just my opinion is if you want to be friends and love dragon dinosaurs be free to friend me
early access review the game has atmosphere like none other would gladly recommend it as its also free the jump scares and ambient sounds compliment the masterpiece that is spooky house of jump scares not only is it fun to play but the game runs at a smooth sixty frames per second has very good characters and areas to explore and will take you by surprise
early access review cool game buddy tries aqua three dimensional open beta in closed it would only take a day to reach level twelve as i heard from other players but in open beta it would take a lot longer now live read comment and i know its a review but a should make a site where they could also read it that way it would help them develop their game yes the games sucks right now no skill tree only four skill which i think sucks since it wont be immersive like wow where you get to choose want kind of character you are like tanker defender or a bit of both i think this was a bit rushed when i heard about aqua three dimensional i thought of all the potential it could have the moment i logged in my hopes were instantly crushed i mean seriously you already have all skills available and you could buy the other class for free except for guardian i don to hate the game i still play and hope it might slowly change and get better but really you have to grind and there are key to enter a dungeon i saw in one of there post since the limit is only three player they limit by putting keys so other players can enter why not build multiple dungeon like dungeon dungeon and it center multiple dungeon so that people can enter is a becoming greedy i really loved adventure quest worlds my friends helped me grind to level sixty five and helped me farm for arc paladin took me hours and days to complete all quest and i a fine with have a multiple class game makes it better who want to have the same class as everyone it just gets boring and most people start talking about aqua three dimensional and then after this post they will say to me i man idiot and i done know and that the game sucks and then they will say in just stating the facts yes what you guys say are true but you just have to be patient heck during the finale of the dark throne saga there were about a players adventure quest worlds is not dead and aqua three dimensional still has potential if i were to review it i would give it seven thousand five hundred and ten its not perfect at first just like adventure quest worlds eight years ago but it was still fun so to people out there who have issues with this game don to play it and i know its just your review but if what you reviewed is not to your liking don to play it then people have different taste in game me in a gamer i really play anything that gets me interested even in adventure quest worlds i want a member but look at me now in level sixty five and no i did not use any bot cause in afraid of getting banned i farmed in shadow realm everyday after school and i did my homework after that but aqua three dimensional is kinda of i just hate farming even today the gap between one thousand four hundred and fifteen is about seven hundred and thirty eight thousand i see a bunch of level fifteen who i think used experience pots and gold pots boost it takes at least a week to farm for that but site the level cap is only fifteen but when they increase the level cap they might adjust it i just hope they might improve this game soon be for its too late and by the way in a hardcore a fan done tell me in an idiot just because of that in not here to judge you since your the ones playing good luck and recommended
i played a lot of trove before it came to steam and participated in alphabet testing i have got to say not only has the game changed a lot it has improved along the way there are tons of new features more items and an over all more refined game for the uninitiated trove is a vowel based sandbox massively multiplayer online where you create your character and travel through different worlds completing dungeons collecting loot gear to progress your character there are many classes in the game and more classes added regularly each class can be switched to on the fly all you need is a wardrobe in trove each player gets there own plot of land that they can take with them everywhere they go all from the start this land can be customized in anyway you can imagine as long as its withing the size limits there are also shared worlds for building called clubs that act sort of like guilds in other mos linking all the worlds and features together is the hub hub world is a place most trojans pass through regularly to get from place to place so its always pretty lively i completely recommend trove to anyone who is a fan of vowel based games sandbox mos or just getting lots of loot
early access review with every update the grind feels like it stretches out longer and longer expect to spend several days of game play to unlock that next weapon or vehicle as repair fees tacked onto every action you take in game cut into what few credits you earn paid content doesn't get you much further purchasing in game gold gives you very little for your money it would feel completely like a pay to win game if it did but the truth is that paying players are stuck with almost all of the same absurdly long grind as the rest of us it should be telling that despite coming up on almost one thousands hours of play i have unlocked only re of the items classes and vehicles in the game and that not drawing from a very large pool of unlock able the weapons are not fairly balanced in the slightest everyone starts with a semi auto rifle which is trash before unlocking a sub machine gun that is unusable at range but decent up close next they'll unlock higher tier sags which are still bad at range but great up close a bolt action rifle once expensively upgraded to a one it kill is a huge upgrade assault rifles make a rifles obsolete legs manage to be even better than assault rifles to us and german legs are absurdly strong despite all the problems it has he is built on a fantastic game engine which manages to feel open world and well paced despite all of the balance problems you'll encounter the game has incredible promise and i hope the he teams monetization and balance strategies are changed drastically soon because they re holding back a game that could be much better with very little work
as requested by a loyal fan here is my review of laura clicker this game was created by the same folks behind the classic laura swim club and laura dungeon but instead of the visual novel flare this game instead is based upon the browser game cookie clicker where you click a cookie however in laura clicker you are instead clicking on anime girls as you progress the girls you click on will gain more health requiring you to hire new girls who do more damage to aid in adding the enemy girls to your harem this also includes bosses gold is usually used to hire new girls but beyond this there is an underlying method of levelling girls for example to unlock abilities like added five gold per girl or twenty damage you may have to spend gold to get a hero to la for an added one hundred attack bonus additionally it is possible to prestige to gain bonuses at the cost of your progress a mechanic which i enjoyed was how you could close the game but when you return you are rewarded with gold which you would have earned if you had stayed on but returning to the game may be required for fighting bosses requiring your presence to click and activate abilities gained once levelling up the main hero another aspect of the game i found interesting was how every enemy girl has a slightly different look whether it is the apparel hair or eye colour the music on the other hand does suffer from being repetitious as far as i am aware there is no story to date or lore as well as no ending or character development however there is a girl by the side of the screen whom you can customise with a small variety of free hair skin eye and clothing options for free but beyond these are micro transactions for weapon clothes and hair downloadable content which in personally not a fan of but does not harm the core game play all in all it is a solid clicker game another hit by the laura team recommend that you play the game with the music and sound effects off with the voice left on another gripe of mine would be the absence of a buff man in the game May
early access review this game is amazing got it for free as part of the special weekend already invested forty into the game bought it for a friend and bought the vanguard founder pack this game is well optimised already even my friend with his terrible laptop can run it on max settings well worth the money guys
early access review game is trash refunding it runs terrible and game play is stuttering and menus freeze when opening and closing the action element of the game is completely lost on the fact you done have any standard attacks every attack move is a hotkey followed by spamming the a keys to create a combo its style is very tasteless on par with term
my vote for the great because i paid award this should win because you literally a rent she if you've never bought stuff in the game everything is based around buying more to be better than others also if you want the first purchase reward done buy it through steam you need to download the arc launcher and log in with your never winter account and buy your stuff through therese and many others made the mistake of buying through steam so yeah pretty pay to win in my opinion well that just my guess anyway maybe if you've no life this game for a few months you might have some decent stuff not likely though overall this game is a lot of fun in the early stages but when you become a reasonably high level you cant compete with people with some better items which you need to buy with money or trade a lot of stuff to get that much and so prepare this game is fun but be prepared to grind a lot if you re a free to play who wants to play with the big boys
early access review does the people who defend this game paid by be wiz they do a better defense than a lawyer seriously how can they like something so and purposely made hard to halt peoples progress so that they done have to release content on schedule
product received for free tried it for a short shoot while and was almost directly of by many different aspects that made me yell more at the game than actually play it the performance was good enough i got a high end rig but i also have twenty nine ultra wide screens the crosshair is not adjustable which ends up filling my screen the characters in arms and weapon just because i have a ultra wide screen just trying to join a battle with is impossible as only my game seemed to bug out and not join the other they also have a system anti cheat that blocks the games input meaning you cant move quit or anything if there is another window overlapping many pal having issue with this in the forums too so yea my experience of this game is not good tried this game once again and ended up getting fucked so hard that it just want fun the issues still seems to be existing the payment model has changed from pay to win to pay fun
this game is great if you love fun dungeons with your friends my favourite thing is the great collection of weapons and interesting crafting i haven played it much on this personal computer but i played it on my friends personal computer so i know its great i rec mend it
early access review stupid overpowered cards now its become who gets the legendary first was a great game ruined by power creep sorry to say live played from the beginning and was very impressed by the game play early mana screw problems were addressed but the constant new releases has turned it into a power shower first to get the big card out wins on the plus side rewards are very generous so you can build a collection easily and make valid decks just done get disappointed when your carefully built board gets wiped by the kill all enemies flying monster please bring in the no legendary leagues to get some balanced play again
this game of where to begin well lets start off with some requirements at least five lbs internet or you will be suffering intel core i dravidian six hundred optional but the game is much more fun with them these are not required to play the game only to play it with decent first person shooter and somewhat decent graphics the first stages of this game are definitely going to be the hardest mostly due to the lack of tutorials you have to find things out on your own but i just cheated and went to the forums once you get past level fifteen the mount level you re pretty much required to spend money on this game if you want a somewhat decent mount i love supporting games like this but if its free to play then it should at least have some options a good time aster
been playing this game since the beta and i can easily say there nothing else like it steam has a fraction of my hours since i used the launcher for many years but you can see the total here tips wow really like this game there a lot of flaws for example the game is combined arms and air is air ground is ground and infantry is infantry all feel very fleshed out and well crafted but where they mix often feels precariously balanced sometimes infantry dominate over vehicles and sometimes aircraft can destroy infantry with no fear of retaliation however the game features an insanely dedicated development team who are very receptive to the community and the game is constantly getting patches and updates if you re looking for a game to sink your teeth into especially if you re looking for a social fix with your shooter i can firmly say planet side two is the only game on the market that can really deliver
this game is in garbage all of my friends have like lets say normal games but me of i get de in the every single in turn like my luck in this game is nonexistent this game like goddamn but hey i still play this game so seven hundred and ten great game
basically just the mobile phone app on the computer nothing fascinating or anything just a nice little game you can leave on in the background when you wanna chill and kill some time
this game used to be fantastic but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment to put this perspective for any new or current players foreigner have become even breeder than war gaming creates world of tanks and that is saying a lot as they have a certain reputation every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however most if not all are overpriced premiums lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pitiful amount of experience gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles and sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as a lot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehash of old planes or tanks already in the game honestly give this game a miss all my a hours were played back during the golden age of the game before the battle royal system and questionable design choices
i used to love this game on my old account i had at least two thousands hours of game time i picked it up again basically as a time waster because they have made it a too hard for any beginners pay to play acc i used to buy veteran and gold but now its useless a you need to buy gold if you want to buy anything within a few weeks of unlocking it
would not recommend between the amount of inappropriate conversations people being absolutely rude for no reason and the game shutting down i would never go back in a simple woman and in a gamer who wants to simply find a game i can enjoy not a game that has raunchy rumour all the time and stops working in sorry but i do nit recommend this game
early access review what the actual is this game this is pure man my god why did i even played this by this game has a horrible server it keeps disconnecting every time and this in game is so sarcastic this game man this game sucks
early access review this game is a horrible pay town piece of garbage in putting a negative review from all four of my accounts and told all my friends some of which done even play it to put a negative review and its staying negative until the game becomes playable this garbage made by a group of inbred degenerates could be so much better it could compete with other big fan base games like laugh out loud counter strike global offensive war frame data two it center if they changed it just a little bit the amount of to the spew with we updated the game and made it better is just sad please fix it also add some dan achievements and trading cards so players get an extra reward besides some random shot in game a lot of players love badges and cards and maybe some tradable items that players can trade with each other through steam like skins or weapons i would also like to mention the fact that about six months ago i played and had bought some weapons and had also spent money on this trash to get some stuff i recently turned on the game to see that the game has been changed and all my stuff was gone and instead of them i had three starter robots that i done want
compared to the other clicker casual upgrade dps games this one doesn't compare well tap tap infinity allows both left and right click buttons for massive manual damage time clickers has the cool gun stuff going clicker heroes has fast multiple level purchases this game though can be fun doesn't play as well as the others the cosmetics are cheesy and too expensive in my opinion perhaps some updates are needed
two hours is all it took suing two i no longer have friends family neighbours the tension is insane we all suing hate each others guts thank you business tour thank you you bunch of she suing waters worst game i have ever played
the best military flight simulator out there but as many negative reviews show this is not a game it is a study sim with some game play elements on top i started playing a few weeks ago and i greatly enjoy it you will enjoy digital combat simulator world if you want to learn about aviation and want to understand how real military aircraft work you enjoy reading six hundred page technical manuals forums and wikipedia pages you enjoy spending hours watching tutorial videos on youtube you own a hot as tracker and can memorize a lot of keyboard shortcuts you have a lot of spare time you enjoy steep learning curve personally i love the experience i currently have about forty hours of game time logged and have spent at least twice as much time reading manuals and watching tutorials yet i feel that i still have so much more to learn it is awesome i would definitely recommend digital combat simulator world and especially the a ten a attack jet downloadable content to people who know what they are getting themselves into if you are looking for a relaxing game where you can jump into an air lane and shoot things better look somewhere else
wow hmm well i spent ten minutes trying to create an account or lookup my old star trek online account info or sign in to the old cryptic account and did several attempts to recover send my password it center it center blah blah and finally gave up signing up for a new game shouldn't be this much trial error annoyance so i gave up might try again next week if i have absolutely nothing else to play gotta say not impressed after the huge epic fail that was star trek online in just not motivated to jump through their hoops to play never winter
early access review if you re anything like me and enjoy tactical cogs like magic or hearthstone you will love this one for some reason i will occasionally branch off to other cogs is legends duels hearthstone it center but i always find myself returning to this dir wolf does a really great job of providing content and it shows how much they care for their game give it a shot its free after all
played till my character reached to lvi seventy this game int really a pay to win like team fortress two a pay only to keep costumes including extra inventory slots too so overall its a good game except in player versus player where the spams are real
early access review solid game probably the next pub killer great weapon balancing nice movement skills like snowboard and your weapon attachments go over to your new weapon if you switch them totally worth it one thousand one hundred and ten
this game is i wait five hours for it to download and when it does it says i have to great a account so i try to make a nickname for my character and everyone a type in it says i cant use it eight out of eight would not play again
i feel like most of the negative reviews for the game come from people who expect it to be free understandably given that it is in fact listed as free the full reality is that this is a game that works like an old time massively multiplayer online role playing game you pay a fee to be able to enjoy it in full the free version allows you to well demo it mostly though if what you want is to roam around a ginormous gorgeous map with a rifle in hand and shoot some stuff i feel like you might be satisfied with what you get anyway personally i done mind paying ten bucks to enjoy a full version of what appears to be a perfectly functional engaging multiplayer game i used to pay that amount for a single month but maybe that just me being old having checked out the micro transactions as well the prices really a rent too obscene when accessed via steam anyway the official page offers less savings for whichever odd reason and you can pretty much do without buying any of that especially if you do end up getting a membership access which automatically grants you a set of clothes to get you through the tougher maps the core systems in place the environments are incredible and the animals are believable and natural shooting whether you prefer that to be with a bullet an arrow or a digital camera all seems to be in order too that said this int a shooting gallery its more in the line of a walking simulator or a crouching through the forest simulator so expect to do a fair bit of that for me that adds to the experience for someone else that a game breaking flaw but if you re an old person like i am and maybe enjoyed the deer hunters from the past which also involved a lot of waiting waiting walking and waiting you'll definitely enjoy this one too and frankly after testing it out in prepared to say that this game is worth a full total of four thousand and fifty bucks on all grounds that i usually judge my games by content playability replay value graphics which so happens to be about the amount i expect to be paying for it in the long run no real complaints here now if just someone would buy me a dog
product received for free some may say this is a min craft clone i say this is not and its own thing yes it is a block based game and has crafting and such but this has free easy to use multiplayer hosted not by the player but the deus own server both i think have great deus but they are great in different ways this game is still in early access so it has things its still yet to do that could be come anything in my eyes there is only one flaw with this game no offline mode but it not as bad as one thinks the server work fine the game can still be played on your own or with others just use a password the community is great and helpful as well deus that are active on the forums and have even asked us the community what kinds of things we wanted we asked for more grass block types and we got it cd who would have thought grass was high on that list but in a joking manner we have dirt slabs where as min craft never kept them note i done favor min craft or creatives over the other as i like both edit the game is out of early access now and its still fun and has lots it can be and has had a great deal added and changed for the game that al still reflects its name and gives you tools for creativity in new ways and the community is great one to be part of edit over the twenty eighteen year id say this game is still doing good and we have had events that were fun for halloween and winter since my last edit of this review and the player models have changed but giving new features to customize them with some that were earn able from doing this last halloween event for free in game and not from the store with girl cash some even for pro players not exactly much tho outside this been done for pro players and that downloadable content tho yet but still say its worth it for the flashlight and glider and the upped inventory overall as well the other perks we also i feel i should say with the upped stack count being nine hundred and ninety nine per stack able item i think our characters finally by normal means can out match that steve and alex fellow in holding the most mass of gold blocks laugh out loud we also got the chance to tame more creatures like the event mods this year so that another perk ill say login the end we mostly got more variations of current sets of blocks and not many store based recipe packs and have let the community vote for what blocks to them next too laugh out loud so the deus are still active and community always in mind May
i would definitely recommend this game pros free to play four continents so if one gets stale you can warp to another massive fights get experience points from kills supporting reviving ammo repairing capping points sites it center squad platoon teamwork experience points gets you certs in which you use to unlock what you want whether it be skills for classes or weapons there so many things to unlock weapons for infantry and vehicles leadership sex squad spawn beacon reuse time request reinforcements server wide it center note you will find these under the social menu skills consumables such as health kits different types of names for different classes it center you can use certs to unlock weapons but before you spend your hard earned certs you can try any weapon vehicle attachment out in virtual reality training go to the world terminal in a warp gate and you'll see it in the bottom left green button squad platoon based game play very well done too much to explain with in game comes tip to mute anyone talking hit enter on the jumped to turn their volume up hit the and to turn them down hit the on the jumped you battle for resources on the map capturing holding hexes and use those resources to resupply consumables such as names healing kits it center spawn vehicles and aircraft more squad info below cons weapon balancing can be an issue nerf wheel comes into play at times if you buy rat real money transaction use virtual reality training before you do to see if you like said wear attachment vehicle or use certs for different weapons they may nerf said item down the road and make it almost useless which leaves you feeling ripped off if big changes come out for like attachments they usually refund your certs though for example there weapons in the game that have lock on at the time you had to buy one for antiaircraft a a and antitank at if you wanted one for each then they added one that locked onto both later but that want the nerf one nerf was for aircraft they severely reduced the range at which you could start locking on lock on takes four seconds mind you so now by the time you start locking on they will use flares and bug out by the then but say they already used flares and a rent long gone they are behind terrain or break los which anything breaks line of site lets say all the above didst happen and you re trying to lock onto an aircraft all they have to do is keep moving and they'll be out of range to finish the lock on aircraft are overpowered in this game they counter vehicles infantry and base defense this is in the hands of a decent pilot of course great pilots are scary not all aircraft are created equal either note then again if you get with a group that will actually work together you can get a squad of maps a class that uses resources and is much tougher than normal infantry with antiaircraft a a weapons or a heavy assault you can create a no fly zone swatting any enemy air that flies by teamwork is heavily rewarded in this game for example field of tanks in front of your base get a squad of heavies or maps and all fire on a single tank at a time and watch as your squad takes them all out one by one and of hey there another squad member giving you ammo while doing it and hey there a medic razing anyone that gets downed of look there a infiltrator using recon devices showing you where all the enemies are he also hacked the turret across the way at the enemies base and is shooting them from behind with their own weapons all the while your entire squad is getting bonus experience points for being at the squad way point defending a base taking out enemy arm or assists and just for being in a squad this is a massively multiplayer online after all people client based hit detection this means you could be safely behind cover on your screen and still get dead a second later because on the enemies screen they re still hitting you same thing applies to you of course shooting an enemy there a lot of minor things that irk me but that the same with many mos can take a long time to get certs especially if you re not playing medic or engineer one cert every up or something like that but that expected sort of they done want to give you everything right now its not that bad and with the recent changes its a lot better to advice for new players find an outfit guild and ask questions when people are talking you can turn them up default keypad and turn them down keypad you can also mute anyone talking by hitting keypad enter very handy shortcuts indeed if you see someone on the battlefield and you want to send them a whisper hold a and you will get many options such as sent whisper add friend ignore it center you can also right click their name in the chat window if it has brackets around it like when someone kills you you can right click their name and send them a tell you can whisper people across servers in all see games air do a google search on specifics hit a to spot enemies it helps your team and you get bonus experience points keep in mind if enemies are close they can hear you be especially mindful if you re and infiltrator this can get you killed look up some tutorials on youtube some are outdated but most still give good information try out weapons attachments vehicles in virtual reality training before spending certs or buying with cash when you join a squad you can filter by all squads on that continent has people in your outfit it center when you join a squad you can hit insert to immediately deploy near your squad leader so you done have to trek all the way to the front lines the a key will redeploy you think of suicide but doesn't affect your stats for example if you re on a kill streak redeploying will not affect your kill streak you can redeploy to another spawn location kill an enemy and you will be on an eleven kill streak it center if you re going to pull arm or be an engineer so you can repair yourself if you re an infiltrator you can hack enemy terminals turrets default is to go up to it when you see the words appear hold a and it will hack it give you experience points and turn the terminal turret to your teams and only your team can use it it stays that way until either its hacked back by their infill or it gets destroyed you can use this to spawn vehicles behind enemy lines you can spawn a sundered find a hiding spot and deploy it deploy is default a and you cant deploy in a red circle on the minimal or a white circle that another sundered shows up with meaning you cant deploy near another deployed sundered then your team can spawn in that sundered and take the base destroy enemies from behind if you re base is getting siege by the enemy done stay in spawn for the love of van get on be point new players just stay in the spawn and do nothing basically so what if you die heres an idea get in a squad platoon coordinate all spawn maps engines medics and max crash the point take it and force the enemy out of your base teamwork people teamwork you can use voice call outs default a and you can request ammo or a heal taunt it center if your voice comes gets screwed up go into voice options a check the use voice box and recheck it hit a to open the map top drop down shows all the worlds the orange blips show how much fighting is going on there are also squad deploy and instant action buttons on the bottom left friendly fire is on done just spam names and such if there a lot of your team mates around and if you friendly fire too much your weapons will be locked i might add more later but youtube is your friend just do a search for a guide tips all in all this is an amazing game and you should definitely try it may
another instance of trio money rubbing the community when this came to steam i got as many friends as i could to play not because i tried it yet but because the concept was enticing we grinder up to max by doing as much as we could got a few of the other classes and all around was just having a good time we stopped playing and a few months ago when dragons came out i gave the game a look and found that i could simply buy a dragon and not have to do the extensive grinding i quit after wasting much time attempting to grind the mats then recently i looked over the game again having in the past known it was good and hoping more that the developers fixed the grind today ratio i learned sadly it just got worse i once did recommend this game but as trio goes their games done last long it sucks this almost made it to the front page on most popular
early access review at the moment aqua three dimensional is lacking that said it also has the potential to go vary far the game is still in early access and to be honest it shows they only have three of the four starting classes from adventure quest worlds and one class that you can pay to buy the mobs so far look good nothing out standing but that part of as charm and the combat is almost the same as adventure quest worlds just with some added depth but the burning question is this is adventure quest three dimensional worth playing yes sure it needs some work but after they get aqua three dimensional up to full throttle it will be as good or even better then the last two instalments
early access review do you like mob game play such as data two league of legends hon and other similar games but you also like big in spaceships with big guns shooting fiery balls of doom and lasers at other spaceship than this is the game for you wait no longer and install no basic you re going five is five with a spaceship of your choice capturing points and eventually trying to capture the enemy base the more points you capture the more resources you gain per second and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage giving you advantage over the enemy ships currently you can choose between fifteen or something ships but this is still alpha more ships to come for sure you got tank ships high damage ships long range ships close range attack ships assassin ship like you go in stealth mode pop up next to enemy ship do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there support ships repair yourself and allies or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies and some mixed ships that have a little of everything i can only say that live liked this game so far there are some downsides like saggy servers like one in five games for me are saggy and one in fifteen or so is like almost unplayable due to lang but that is what you get when you play alpha release other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game unless you alter some files which is really annoying if you are one of the few people belgium france that use alert keyboards because the controls are for qwerty which means you control the ships movement with esd instead of sad you can fix this by pressing alt shift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode but than you will not be able to type properly all in all great game i am sure they will fix these problems in the near future and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps and modes to play i rate it seven thousand five hundred and ten
this game is complete and utter i wanted to give it a chance but of course the first day they were having server issues so i decided to wait it out played for a little bit but still was not impressed graphics are horrible you re lucky to be alive after ten seconds after spawn since people just seem to sit there and kill you for no damn reason this being mentioned there is no ave servers at all the battle ground spawn is literally the most thing live ever seen in a video game it spawns you inside of like five other players and everyone just waits right there at the spawn to get kills there is literally no point in even putting their half minded thought into creating a map you be better off making it a ten foot square room and saying here you go guys you have to try and join a server like five times before the game either doesn't crash or make you sit through the long loading screen just until finish and it notifies you that you have been disconnected from the server the only positive thing i could say about this game is that its free not that anyone would pay money for this price of game created by people with the brains the size of hamsters live literally became so mad with this game i done even care how bad my grammar is in this review if anything they will understand most of it fully do not even waste your time with this game they will probably delete this comment or ban me but i done really care you have been warned
holy this game is so good if you like skill based first person shooter space and mobs then this is the game for you the free to play model is play own two of the best ships to play with are starter ships i love how they made some ships eligible to be better than others but they re way harder to play with live been practising with one of these hard ships and rocking like crazy took me four hours of fun free game play to afford the interceptor get this game then get god one thousand one hundred and ten lizards would totes lathe again
early access review am rather surprised i haven typed up a review for this gem yet i backed since it released in two thousand and fourteen it was a bit basic but they continued on with small hot fixes and massive updates and was the only game i knew it want going to fail within backing terms every aspect strings my sweet spots good graphics on the ships mob team play and best of all large ships this game is reasonably priced and worth every penny nothing is too overpowered and its not pay town the developers are extremely generous with its wonderful price tag free weekends occasionally and fifty off one thousand and ten
one never played these sandbox rafting games decided to check what was all this about started the game and had no idea what to do just followed the simple instructions on my screen got something going harvested and collected a few things built some walls and no roof and stayed inside it afraid of the monsters in the dark made a bell to tame pets and got a lea fie super cute and adorable my best friend in this lonely world lea fie went missing after i was a couple of minutes away from keyboard waiting for a few crafts i panicked went out all the way to search for lea fie and reached a tundra attacked a giant tundra chicken and got killed end of journey all i ever wanted was to find my missing friend lea fie would do it all over again
early access review ask me about forty six months ago whether or not to recommend this game i would have said yes me and my friend loved playing this as riflemen firing from afar with iron sights we were saving up for the bolt action rifle not spending money meant we would have had to play for a while but it want too slow and a few hours of play would have got us the rifle it was honestly quite a fun game but we got sidetracked and played other games and i recently decided to start playing again hardly anything can be bought with in game currency and the cost of the weapon has risen meaning what would have taken hours may very well take weeks i used to enjoy this game and in free to play games i will usually throw in ten every now and then if the game keeps me entertained for a couple of months and i can get through it without feeling disadvantaged not purchasing something i was on track to do so but now i cannot support this game do not install May
start a game four of my team mates abandon two of my enemies abandon on of them says you know we will win me challenge accepted buy three rapiers get two rampages win would a again
the game itself int bad but from a porting standpoint it is i mean yeah you can grab the game and its still fun but from the mobile version this port is still pretty much the same they didst even bother to fix the resolution just adding glorified black bars to the sides of the screens in short good game but the port itself was pretty much useless
early access review aircraft is a constantly changing game were star made and world of tanks feel like they had a child pros you get to build your own vehicle making your imagination important to pamela game feels unique and unlike other running requirements are low any design choice can have benefits and drawback weapons all feel different any ways to move your design are offered maps feel a bit unique no pay to win issues frequent updates cons armour block heavy designs tend to die faster than what you would think outdated mrs have been nerved to the point were they done feel like they can do there old jobs now outdated as of some of the game modes feel rather unbalance medics determine the out come of matches a little too heavily outdated game balance seams to change faster than you can adapt your design at time premium account needed in order to make rapid progress requires commitment to feel fun do to frequent game change summary this is a good game done get me wrong its just that there seams to often be a lack of sustained game balance one day something is added and seams to make designs invulnerable and the very next day the opposite is true there is often no middle ground all that said i still like this game the unique and original feel helps here overall this game deserves a edit i would like to add here an additional final thought while a lot of community back lash has occurred as of late i still have faith in the developers for the most part having been playing since the days when this game had repair costs pay to win issues where much more prevalent back then i feel i know what in talking about i do however believe that the loot crate system while nice does need a few touch ups
runs faster with better guy game balance and deck management than magic the two lane gimmick works well i have to tip my hat to the programmers and designers they could have mailed it in and created a cookie cutter buggy card game but they actually made a top notch quality game one of the better trading card battle games on steam still looking for the perfect one to absorb my time this is not it but good for casual games every once in a while
early access review do not play this and if you do done play as germany because they were originally a fair opponent until the great defining were they they got nerved so much that they have to pay royalties to nerf and def tiny done play as tanker because ninety nine of the time you will get killed by and infantry to the point you fear them more then tank destroyers which are tanks meant for destroying other tanks and done forget the pard which one shots infantry cars with its infinite range accuracy and damage seriously developers fix the god damn game rather than adding in more and more half baked content that is pointless or makes the game even harder for german players which already have it hard enough why the hell am i even saying anything the developers wont listen to the community also did i mention to fix the god damn servers being hosted on pluto all the time like jesus christ
early access review eternal is a great fast paced card game with really good and well thought out game design i recommend it to anyone looking for a card game that not hearthstone or a card game with a much faster pace then mtg
well a month back this game was bad but cool lots of crashes hard to start but nice to play with friends the deus done seem to be doing anything at all to make the game better just to kill it even more than it already is and add lots of skins to earn money of today was the rip for me i would like to see this being a good game but like things are going i have almost to no hope
a year ago i would tell anyone to stay away from this game today my point still stands as you can sink many hours in to it if you have the determination to get through all your deaths and in to the later point of this game
diabolo two of material system solid arg with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery and a brilliant end game with great features a lot of the space between can really really suck though as you bottleneck your build at the gear level needing very specific number color and connection schemes of slots and needing those setups on items with decent stats as well highly recommended for the most hardcore and the most casual normal players may find themselves bored and leaving in the mid game or playing a large number of characters and fighting with stash space May
not only does it allow you to disassemble and reassemble expensive or illegal for civilian ownership firearms without the risks it is handy if you can find a rifle you own to learn how to take it apart before you take it apart in real life
i exclusively play tank simulator battle with a premium captured tank you can rampage through the enemy ranks without being noticed this game mode is a pay to win the fun is gone
early access review torah this game deserves more more than a whole universe galaxy this game is not really meant to be free to play at least ten eur is good why making it free to play i just done get it to its not such a bad game and the balance is good they update it and at least the people who made fractured space are trying and trying and they wont stop trying not like the others like just do it for over twenty three years receive the money alight then stopping with the updates and it center but this a a it int like this fractured space the developers admins it center are really good as you can see on the forums to people start making games something like fractured space think about the game not only for the money think about the players not the money no need pay to win such a dirty game such not a bad game i recommend you this game you wont want to refund it i am telling you have fun on the space battle field hama and done forget the gamma gamma wonder how to type on all chat just hit enter then write all chat message also i didst knew the ship sentinel supporter gotta help dem
a pretty fun game but one major problem of mine is that i have to deal with obnoxious messages in and out of a game it mainly comes from the use of the megaphones its really annoying and i would love it if i could block it one other thing bothering me is that there int much variety when it comes to black characters overall its a fun game i just wish i had more choices when i play more specifically chat settings and character options i mean there are a lot of no black characters there even a in gorilla the community is terrible by the way
this game is at everything great no costs only if you want premium with which you can trade nice game play many modes which you can play from ctr up mann versus machine and much more and you get random items which you can for ever use great game just give it a try it will be worth
currently the game is no longer fun foreigner is just over the entire community unless your russian and only sees us for the money in our wallet we have been bring up pointing out and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only gotten worse the only thing that foreigner has done to make it seem like they might pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel however this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel of by the way they are under a ada which makes them completely worthless to begin with an obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from gains part the to for example very rarely catches fire explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank there was recently a poll on their forums started by players to change the battle ratting from a ten spread between vehicles to seven so for example tiger i is done have to fight tanks from the korean war last i checked the poll was at about three thousand one hundred for yes and thirty for no foreigner has officially stated they will not change the battle royal system and that it is perfectly fine despite this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree if you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier three is playing russian vehicles also on a observational note the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively disproportional to the other nations just saying they seem to be paying more attention to a certain nation than others as the game is i simply cannot recommend you join and waste your money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian the only reason i have not stored playing this completely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it
early access review love this game reminds me of world of war craft its definitely different from adventure quest worlds although the community is just full for raging little kids the game its self is quiet enjoyable i would suggest it if you want a nice peaceful massively multiplayer online role playing game game to just relax and enjoy
early access review this game is literally everything pub should have been on launch this game also has an interesting endgame scenario instead of being the last player alive to achieve victory a help flies down and drops a ladder and offers extraction for a total of four passengers to escape from the blizzard you may think well that int too much fun players will just camp the ladder up into the help that is true however to keep that play style from being abused too much after a certain amount of time players are revealed on the map forcing a potential extraction or intense gunfight while in pub its whoever can stay prone the longest until you spot a potential kill great idea and for me personally well executed it brings some freshness to the genre gun play is great too also the game is faster than pub but its not over in ten minutes either its just the right amount of time there is so much more but ill let you all explore this game yourself of course the game has its problems too as many do some minor frame drops and lag here and there from what i have experienced but its not game breaking at all nor a reason not to play it note in comparing this to pub because they are so damn similar an many many ways and i feel this game does it all one thousand times better and its free one thousand and ten May
overall if you enjoy yes universe this game is good more complex than hearthstone less complex than magic however it is pay to win like pretty much every other free to play game you do not stand a chance against someone who spent money on lets say the dark brotherhood downloadable content finally i cant help but notice after playing this game for over half a year before steam release it seems to follow the motto one step forward two steps back
waste of time live spent more time loading the game just to get instantly disconnected from solo play than i have actually playing the game you have to pay to play other games which is to just play day he literally any of their competition is better than them
early access review yes i did not play this game for long yet i intend to spend more time on it though looks pretty cool and solid only thing i did not like was that someone wanted me to be kicked of the team play just because i am a noon to the game really i am sorry that i shot at you but when the game started all hell broke loose and everybody was just shooting i did not know scratch so i just started shooting to whoever was closest oops that was a mistake then i was still trying to figure out the controls and interface and they say i am just camping come on it is the first time ever i got into the game and you scowl at me like that seriously that was a bit rude man i really am sorry i shot at you please forgive me wait i have an answer next time just be in the other team and you can take out on me a now that will be more than fair hey mon mate lets make some peace and shake on ito a the game looks of for now
the game is a grind this game is very unclear on many aspects even after tutorials you are left to searching online for answers to your questions choose the wrong selection no confirmation for the selection and och sorry no going back win three ranked matches for a whole fifteen gold one hundred gold a booster pack of six cards so you have to win twenty ranked duels per pack duplicates beyond what your deck can hold are possible why would you set up the is dust system when you make this kind of a grind required for new cards grind org so grind the duel lane is nice but not an original idea as so many have described it as legends of nor rath did this first i believe and that game was out for a very long time visuals and sounds are well done server stability seems solid live never given a free game a thumbs down until now this game could be a lot of fun but no pay to win or done play take cared
live been playing this for nearly a year now before i start the steam download of smite is buggy so go download it from the official site its not as bad but still crashes and disconnects frequently i love this game so lemme list all the cons first yes the game has possibly the worst hardware live ever seen players get disconnected every two or three matches on average and every patch released completely trashes the game launcher forcing you to manually delete all game files and install the game again and done count on official support either hire clearly takes customer service lessons from a the community is toxic and hostile like any other mobs or competitive games just as russian players famously ruined data two for everybody spanish and latin american players suffer from the same notoriety in smite most of the time for good reason but i wont go into the details the eur server is basically to be avoided at this point for people whose first or only language is english i would highly recommend hire make language based servers just like in star wars the old republic to help reduce cultural clashes and miscommunication britain is no longer part of the eur anyway so there that the game itself is awesome if you manage to get it running by some miracle of the gods speaking of gods of man where do i begin as a mythology nerd i can say without a doubt the gods in the game are presented in respectful and lore friendly ways ninety five of the time and smite easily has the best skins in any mob ever however balancing is apparently not the primary concern of the developers and even diehard fans of the game will admit this i have pts from louis sound effects and in sure in not the only one guardians deal way too much damage and matchmaking is so broken even famous smite you tubers make fun of it see myth moo despite all its flaws smite is good immersive fun the third person mode combat makes everything feel more alive and engaging and that probably the best thing about smite the sound design department deserves a raise as well i wish there was lore explaining why the gods are all fighting each other but that not central to the game you wont care why because the sheer notion of gods fighting each other is awesome enough on its own my favourite gods are chinese and i highly recommend to huang the dragon king of the eastern seas hes very hard to master but you can literally eat other gods with his ult duff said and then there everybody favourite monkey sun wrong dynasty warrior fans will also be pleased to know guan you is in the game as well and his beard and green dragon crescent blade are awesome as always seven hundred and ten not a perfect game but best mob out there right now
early access review of the balance issues if you get dropped into a crap location your best option is suicide seriously if you done get a decent weapon nearby you really have no chance after about one minute and when you blast some poor sucker in the first few seconds with your shorty and he has a knife you kinda feel bad for them but what sucks beyond belief is the number of times you get caught in furniture and other props its a major design engine failure that makes it so frustrating the game is not worth playing until they fix it
this game was great as soon as the development team realised it on steam few years ago not many people play it but now that the last update with the servers on for the record is released everything can be purchased with in game credits i recommend you to give it a test with friends and also an opportunity if you like space games this one is easy to understand and fun to play needs a boost of players
early access review hours in and my friends and i have finally started to min craft the game exploiting loopholes glitches and creating spawn farms it took eight five hours for us to get to the point where we started hoarding for mega building and doing mass corruption runs in impressed i want more
planet side two is and with no doubt the fps to out there the game is simply massive the game is free but if you want to buy stuff like came guns and stuff you have to get station cash which is the in game money in my case i never bought anything with station cash just a two bucks small pack off steam the other way you can get upgrades and weapons is by getting certs which you gain by killing enemy players repairing vehicles and units though many of these weapons are kind of expensive in terms of certs and it takes a while to get some of them but in time you start getting certs and using them to upgrade your vehicles and your characters shields and or qualities if you are new to fps the game play could be a little bit confusing and hard to understand but once you get the idea and the whole concept you enter into a new level of battle forget about call of duty or battlefield those games look tiny and insignificant next to the massive idea behind playstation two total war is unleashed every day between the three factions introduced in the game go no go it is not necessary to buy weapons in my honest opinion but the base weapons you start with especially for the no are wild and sometimes hard to manage due to the recoil but in time you get used to it battles develop in a massive scale you get to see dozens of tanks battling each other aircraft do fighting in the limitless sky hundreds of soldiers shooting and firing everywhere total chaos that is rewarded with a fun time even more if you are part of an outfit which makes things much more fun and interesting once you get to understand the game you feel the need to keep on playing even to the extent that you forget about your whole library and cant quit the excellent approach of this game if you are looking for a whole new experience in multiplayer gaming planet side two is for you i totally recommend this game for all gamers plus it is totally free
early access review me playing the new epic loot updates arts up robert queues up for battle arena play like garbage get a bronze crate opens the crate gets one epic hardware piece me alright queues up for another battle arena game gets first on the team get a plutonium crate opens the crate gets all uncommon blocks me no closes rob craft
if you think this game is full of year old because its free you be correct if you think that this game is full of jerks you be correct if you think this game is full of hackers you be correct that puts people away from this game many people also put themselves away from this game because of how difficult it can be it has a really high skill ceiling one of my favourite parts of the game itself is that its a first person shooter dude there a mode that based around medieval times with no guns to be honest that probably the most realistic part of this game no in kidding but seriously though there so much variety that really any type of gamer can enjoy this with practice or just messing around if you like to play competitively go ahead you wanna play the game to win but you done want the pressure of being good play casual if you wanna straight up mess around deathwatch or have everyone on the server be friendly go on orange like cosmetics that make the game more snazzy trade or waste your money but done buy anything from the mann co store unless its an exclusive item the community sometimes is absolute crap but i haven really experienced that most people live met have been really nice to me i like to play the game and trade to get cosmetics skins and other stuff that i like and maybe profit along the way thank you to everyone who int an absolute jerk in the community and makes my life seem better every day specifically everyone on my friends list who is actually my friend go ahead an add me if you want we can play some time i accept all requests but i will ask you who you are if you re new and need advice in here but yes i highly recommend this game just tip done wear the ghostly gibbs please just done
valve do your goddamn jobs and out of your stupid no teams flat organizational work no bosses structure maybe if you actually forced people to work instead of taking up whatever easiest or trendy at the time you have some good games or actually make games or updates even a of all people has this down team fortress two was on an equilibrium with the rest of valves titles counter strike global offensive and data two for a long time but then somehow the teams got so lopsided that you have five people working on team fortress two and so now you re irrelevant and unless you reboot this game with consistent updates its on a downwards slope towards imitating counter strike global offensive nobody gives a about virtual reality i cant in justify one thousands bucks or even five hundred or two hundred or one hundred for a virtual reality headset with no games why done you actually make launch titles or games for virtual reality if you re so headset on virtual reality technology you re supposed to be a in game company but no you re valve corporation
well it starts off as being a bit of a sammy game but once you get to know how the attacks work and really how to play the game it becomes a lot more fun i recommend this game to any one that enjoys super smash bros or rivals of aether if you buy the game when you have enough coins to buy a character i recommend buying mirage one of her weapons the scythe is fairly complicated but is very fun to use once learned her other weapon the spear is fairly easy to learn but hard to master
despite my hours i have played this game over a few years now and i have occasionally checked in on how its doing taking into consideration the deus and their actions also the track this game is heading down it could have been great at what it was designed to do but the deus failed the fans and the fans failed to push the deus from the beginning there were numerous server issues a few years ago there was a point when the game was basically unplayable also the deus love micro transactions so much they turned this game into the equivalent of a slot machine in las vegas micro transactions can be of if they come in small quantities but when the game is built on them its a bit excessive with the hours of all of me and my friends combined we have close to around twenty three hundreds hours and its safe to say we are all displeased with how the game has turned out the one shimmering light in the void that is this game is the great community it has over the years throughout its popularity and the decline recently the community has be a constant bright spot for the game and one of the best i have experienced the people may be patient but the deus will be the death of this game May
sublimely magnificent game which put your mind at ease an be played with one hand or no hand great for exercising your fingers while exorcising and purifying monsters yet getting lots of gold making you feel extremely rich just by sitting down looking at the screen
early access review slowly but surely killing their own game decided to spend the money sponsoring streamers than actually updating the game in good ways its saggy at the start of the game animations are probably worse than min craft hit boxes are completely broken plenty of cheaters to add on top of that but that expected from a free to play game that spend money on streamers and not somewhat decent anti cheat
game was great until patch seven hundred released why do i have to continue playing with the imitation from heroes of the storm talent tree switching to play hots makes me feel more genuine time to sell my a account for some
back in twenty sixteen i would not have recommend this game because of the meet your match update i dropped from team fortress two since this time but now live started playing team fortress two again and damn it feels great even if its not the same game like years ago i still got the feeling of the good old game fun fact i think live spent more time trading than actually playing the game it was fun
school of dragons is a massively multiplayer online role playing game set in the universe of the twenty tens critically acclaimed dream works animations film how to train your dragon and its sequel step into the life of a viking dragon rider and journey beyond the isle of berk to the mainland continent and the surrounding islands home to dozens of exotic dragons train your dragon from birth join clans and unite with your fellow dragon trainers ride on the backs of these majestic winged beasts and relive the thrill of how to train your dragon in stunning graphical detail free to play is what i would say if i was paid to promote this very bad game
i came into this game knowing what it would be like since i have played it on mobile this game is well polished it has great sounds animations and art why am i not recommending this game it is perfect for mobile but on the personal computer it just doesn't fit this is a game that is built to check at different time intervals throughout the day it is not something that can be actively played in not able to sit down in a one hour session and get anything useful done since most things have immense time limits my advice to the developers is to curate more content for the personal computer version instead of free to play slap a price on it i wont be buying in game packs simply because its not worth it ill be playing other games this is just a cash grab on the desktop
the whole game is great this is one of those games that just nails it but the money system is terrible want a new gun pull out you credit car want an animal licence pull out your credit car want to play the game pull out your credit card
early access review the bullet spray on the weapons are so random meaning its just luck if you kill someone there is no skill set in this game and dependent on luck i would not recommend wasting your time to download this game
early access review not as childish as footnote not as intense as pub unique competitive fun game progression seems to be polished of only lags very briefly fifteen games compared to most releases nowadays that gets a one from me very fun with buddies
positive an extreme amount of variety in game modes weapons classes base game play is satisfying addicting and just plain fun lots of cosmetics and with a price free to play and not pay to win free content updates keep the game fresh ways of playing exceed that of a generic shooter friendly community neutral the way the of team updates the game is very problematic as its essentially six months of nothing then a giant update with lots of content and then again five months of nothing preferred would be a medium update every twenty three months to keep matters fresh negative the game int exactly the most polished bugs are found in several corners and while most of them a rent game play impacting to the level that you'll find yourself blaming a bug for a death its just ugly ten years of updates on the source engine can do a number on a making the game somewhat unstable and optimized the death of community server this game is something special alright not only was it with me for seven years now but its also something life changing most of my people in my friends list i have met via team fortress two and you know what they say your friends also affect you team fortress two is responsible for some of the most fun i had in a video game and it will probably stay like for that several years to come and here comes the tragedy community servers have been what made team fortress two extremely fun to me playing with friends people you know on a familiar environment now that gone because the of team wanted to make the game more consistent and streamlined for newcomers people will never get to experience a community server ever again unless its some weird memes it like saxon hale and that awful i still enjoy the game i still play it with the friends i made on community servers but i just question players that didst experience said community servers where will they make their friends casual servers are about as personality free as your average over watch character you wont make any friends there you'll always play with strangers but done let this distract you team fortress two is an amazing timeless classic with the most solid game play available in shooters in just rambling
this is probably one of the greatest and most addictive games live ever played some people have compared it to laugh out loud but on steroids and in three dimensional its a great team competition game its in space using capital ships i done know what else anyone could ask for a highly recommended keep up the good work egg basically you captain a capital ship with a specific set of abilities and you have to work with four other people against five other people to try and capture their base its great teamwork and a lot of fun after reading some reviews this is not a pay to win game you can buy all the downloadable content and it will not help you win a match its a combination of team composition teamwork and skill implants increase a specific ability in your ship a bit not light and day you need to know what ships can deal with what pick your targets strategically and work as a team this is seriously one of the greatest games live ever played
early access review one of the best games i ever played straight up great game its team based great game play and its only in alpha a a if you missed out on the free weekend where you if you logged on and you got the game for free then you missed out big besides that its worth the buy in for the early access its just a great game if you like space ship types games again one of the best games i ever played
pay to win i liked it for a hot second but then i found out how cheap it is if you just buy the overly expensive items whats the point in strategy if you can just pay to automatically have more money and health per round decrease your opponents health by two every fifteen seconds weaken all blooms on your side by one level automatically and transfer blooms on your side to theirs with added came and or lead upgrades that all one tower that can be yours if you just buy five thousands coins even if i bought money for this game i wouldn't use something like that no game should have something that broken and worst a lot of people i found do it when a match is even it is fun but it int when you have the chance for a instant lose would recommend otherwise but not with that in the game
vanilla wot takes quite long time to finish a match large maps and have a arty that what makes it fun for me on vanilla wot what makes it fun in wot blitz is it only take like three minutes to finish a match sometime small maps and no arty that what make wot blitz fun for me
live barely gotten into but wow its a great clicker game you can play it for a while and not be bored if you choose the right path it has tons of upgrades and good graphics its the best clicker game one thousand and ten would play again sorry if you done know that meme
early access review let me preface this with the fact that i have played this game for years now i started this game when the only modes you could play were training and battle there were no re spawns and no objective other than to kill the other team and have the best robot i loved this game allow me to walk you through my experience one spend fifty hours grinding to level one hundred with friends spend fifty hours and some money to support the deus grinding and coming up with an amazing megabit idea spend seventy hours and some money to keep the subscription up building your megabit and grinding for money for parts new update of loot drops us of of my megabit is entirely red why of no cup they removed megabits thanks for ruining a game deus if you want this to come back as a playable game you need to remove all these updates bring it back to what the game used to be about creation and imagination as for right now do not give these people money or time this game has gone from an amazing free team based sandbox vehicle battleground to another fine example of terrible deus
i amt not from ukraine i am from russia there is very big different yes stay away from the germans they are very big noon hacker
early access review insane for a free game to compete not only well but better than pub and other pay for battleground games a plethora of guns that not only look and sound great but are well rounded and all have their pros and cons
the only thing better than playing a and game is playing a tabletop and game inside this and game or perhaps maybe a picture of a brandy snifter in sid a picture of a brandy snifter sol
early access review mean a lot of people say they made the game better but a lot of high level players disagree with this the updates when they added more weapons like the lock on rocket launcher but here i have to say that the newest update changes everything for the old players because they have access to everything in the game now that is normal because they achieved it from playing the new players can now get everything and boast i would like them to make the chest better fro the people above lvi seventy or something but much weaker for the newer players and it gets better
early access review first day playing rather suck through a straw second third and fourth day playing abandoned straw and proceeded to on folks fifth day trying to front flip my snowboard into the help in hopes that it will launch me across the in cosmos so that i may forget i ever played pub overall thought fun dislikes sometimes feels like in playing a mobile version of an first person shooter May
this game is a free game which is really interesting and nice physics of driving but you need to give money to earn new cars and that sucks hard fun for a little ride but i done think it will last long
early access review of i used to highly recommend this game now with the new loot system loss of a tech tree and lack of block their there is really no reason to play it if you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want or you can just pay for it sadly it looks like the money men won out with this game they got rid of all the good stuff so little kids can just hop on and get everything they want or buy what they want if you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that took time effort and game knowledge your looking at the wrong game now this has gone over to the kidd premium side it was a great game that made you want to work to unlock better guns wheels and arm or now you can just get the best items in the game if you do well in a match i left after the huge bot update that had everyone bidding behind the big bot in the front because it got really boring like cod got you just shot back and forth until you killed the medic bots behind the huge bot so i left and now when i come back hoping to find that they evened things out and maybe added a few more game modes i sadly find a great game has been gutted in order to make more money it kind of seems like the game manager went on vacation leaving the money men and the script is to go nuts while there are some new finish mechanics there is now a lack of any restrictions want a sniper medical bot sure why not kids have fun we used to have to carefully craft our machines for a role like defender attacker wall tank you name it we had to come up with a solution on how to fill that roll we only had so many bots to make before they charged us for it making us carefully construct our machines now you get as many slots as you want and can go bot happy while i do like that they use a workshop allowing you to use other peoples bot designs as long as you have the stuff for it that is a small plus in all of the new negative aspects of this game
early access review the game clearly int finished yet but for an alpha the game plays very well it has more of a tug of war feeling that other mobs its not just about farming creep and pushing towers since there are neither at least not in the game mode i have played visually the game is stunning and there are may different ships you cant play as with carrying levels of customization the is a micro transaction system in place much like league of legends you collect in game currency credits to spend on ships crew members and ship upgrades or you can buy platinum for all the same things plus skins for you ships all in all i give the game eight hundred and ten may
early access review looking for bad review not for this gem what is pluses in this game great atmosphere five good maps one of them seems like dust with different textures great physics easy to play aim but mouse movement so smooth a bit hard to control intuitive interface donate only for ranges and masks for your character only three hundred my size of the game english and russian language a lot of server what is minuses bad recoil animation only one mode deathwatch bad buy interface but its of for early access this is first game made by russians developers i think only war team know how to make great games like that
""
early access review any as all living hell and not in a good way the first person camera has your guy nearly the sight into his eyeball making it impossible to aim and third person is no better with the reticle swinging all over the place even the character movement is pretty subpar i know this was supposed to be a joke but it has enough thought into it as a fart joke
early access review mediocre game but some real annoying things when you make contact with another player whether it be friend or foe you teleport on top of his head even with mouse accel off it feels like its on knife if glitchy sometimes it hits sometimes it doesn't seems random
early access reviewers are so out of touch with this game boring reviews on steam by who doesn't accept meta changes tiers wont come back deal with it it int about tiers its about the terrible drop system and lack of actual progression now had a first place game and got twenty cones never even used a cone in my life think the new rob craft is really fair to new users i have been playing for a couple of days and i am full of stuff to recycle was being shot at by homing rockets from the skies while in a two hundred cup game with a new friend two hundred wat new players get jack add a steady income after game like before and this problem goes away matchmaking is quite literally nonexistent game was fine before this a bit grind but fine this is not worth playing if you are a new player
early access review most fun i have had in a new game in a long time learning curve is there but very slight in my opinion rules of the game are easy to follow and understand user interface is pleasant the premium real money currency is unneeded as gaining experience and credits through game allows you to master the starter ships and after only a couple of matches i believe i was able to credit a new rig and played the heck out of it before i went back to a starter ship to build more experience in another faction fun game glad to be a part of the alpha stage excitedly looking forward to beta and the full release of fractured space do not let the mob title scare nondurable agents players away this is another capture points player player team based your skill as a pilot shines your skill and i really like that aspect of the game
this game has been a blast to play purchasable items are a bit overpriced but they done feel necessary to acquire in order to enjoy the game the player created content is a great addition to the game as well and can make the dungeon queue times fly by
early access review only thing i done have a problem is the content overall they did do a good job over the years with a majority of the content but lets be very honest here we got players on this game who are pretty stupid and by that lets say like majority have an in of five they done have anything better to do than just sit around and bash and troll each over over stupid game currency or we they also lie about a lot of what they do unreal life just to make themselves imitating and this applies on adventure quest worlds as well community is legit cancer so that one very major downside next some developers make way too many reworks devalues the original rares the real veterans spent time to obtain all those years maybe be more creative instead of copying stuff yeah and maybe also not seeing certain players as special because i cannot recall how many a players on twitter beg the developers for random special rares because they thought they were special they need to do this for all sex and current moderator and testers because they end up getting an unfair advantage by loading rares that wont be removed from their accounts so the rework and loaders is another very major setback now in speaking for everyone on this one biggest one none of the staff members were able to ever address bots way too many of them yes they were originally on adventure quest worlds but now live seen a few of them on aqua three dimensional now i personally spoke with the lead moderator for aqua three dimensional regarding this once nothing has been done about that and same story for adventure quest worlds nothings been done after sending a email in concern there are far more bots on adventure quest worlds than aqua three dimensional but without anyone dealing with the bothers on both games gives the cheaters a bigger and of course an unfair advantage now these are three major reasons why i do not recommend this game nor would i recommend the other version this is also why it has gone downhill ever since two thousand and twelve if the a staff were to assess and do something about these key points there is a chance id see hope for a again its also why i done come on both games that often these days aboriginal adventure quest player since june and player since beta testing in june and player since alpha testing in august two thousand and fifteen june
i suggest more maps with different capture point placements the game is good so far and i like it but i noticed that there a shortage of people playing the game or i was just too late playing it most of the time it takes around ten minutes waiting in player versus player mode i guess ill have to do coops for now
i was happily surprised live played all the main wow guild wars two and so on but never winter brings me back to a time in my gaming that i had a great time playing i am working my way to la seventy now so is all a getting to know my way around but the game really helps you alone live been to new areas much quicker tea nay other game as a newbie so its fresh and immersive for me thumbs up from elder gamer
early access review like this game its fun playing with your friends and the new blue prints system to craft them instead of buying them with real life money is really good although some people might be disappointed with the new pro pack but i still like this game
very fun game especially after update only problem i have is those a a a king huge gauntlets the characters use now they just done look like something you could wear without hurting yourself in some fashion it just done look right edits typos
good game there are daily that take about twenty minutes so if you done wanna play the game it doesn't take to long to complete on the other hand there are missions so if you wanna play even after your dailies you can free to play have good opportunities to win
i was excited for this game at first if i could just maybe just maybe find a name that int taken i mean come on a shit is taken really really one thousand and ten would dream works game again
this game is broken live never actually been able to play it even though i have tried to many times it will not let me sign with my linked google account and the website it takes me to if i ask to create a new account or to say i forgot my username has no functioning content to help
my experience in team fortress two how i see players with those hours hours hours ghastly gibbs hat and provision goggles free to play little kid yelling on everyone hours after hours ask mon for ten buys four keys heard from some one about those unusual hats which cost sixty thousand one hundred trying to open boxes and get hat one cosmetic item and one strange written in orange weapon and unique weapon at least is not a free to play noon now with relation hours after two hundred hours has many smelt refined metal first trading has just begun hours have good and valuable inventory from trading hours from trading makes very valuable items or spend little bit of money of not ours ties to get unusual hat and spends two thousand and sixty or maybe someone not spend it those hours some people are rich with unusual hats and items inventory overall two hundred or more some chance it to real life money some buy games someone got scared and lost everything but what i can say about myself i played team fortress two about seven hundred and thirteen hours spend only fifteen and i never had unusual hats but i had hats cosmetic items strange written in orange weapons i had valuable inventory and not one scams me i hate hacker cheats i hate teenagers and little kids who sending those phishing link tries to scam other players in scammers i hate little kids who yelling on servers and saying how are they slept with your mother in the bed and saying how call of duty and halo are better then of one of the best personal computer game of all time
product received for free this game crashes a lot why i have to admit this new epic loot update is great for the first hour or two if its your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumbs ones you get the very first time you play the game though once you get over how amazing that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is you'll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish especially since you have to buy premium to get half of whats in the crates anyways this crate system can be seen one of two ways either pay town or getting on your knees and praying to the ring gods that once just once you get an epic item from your plutonium crate also heres a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone i found a stinking legendary item in a bronze crate but i needed premium to have collected it the same thing happened to my friend but with a different item speaking of big guns they are literally all you need to excel at this game i build a seven hundred and fifty flop tank and it loses to some tiny bot ninety of which is a single gun seriously i could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship i guess not but who am i trash talk micro bots i built one myself and i can get six kills in a single deathwatch with it most of the time building goes into where i should put more hover blades finally this game crashes a lot though most of the time it seems to happen when i finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well what a coincidence edit its been a while and there have been many big changes to rob craft so i feel that my review could use an update too first off my thoughts on the fast and formidable update as a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts i enjoyed having the ability to build a two thousands flop maximum value robot although quite a few rob craft veterans would disagree i think this update was a small step in the right direction i could build as i please but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot but this brawl update this brawl update is no fun free am has decided to instead of listening to the community remove multiple game modes and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the brawl mode this would have been fine if they did it like over watch and just added a brawl as a new game mode but no though at this point id be a fool to be surprised when free am disappoints the community
i love smite it will forever to me be the most fun mob on the market game has a few small problems that can be fixed but will they hard to tell hire needs to develop a way for people to understand how to play the game as a master conquest player this season peaking at fiftieth in the world ranking i understand this game more than anyone can hope to understand a game even in the highest level of games players still done understand fully what to do they need to pay people like me or other well known players to create videos teaching players how to actually play smite game has a great casual side matchmaking can be very poor at times because of lack of players at times hire genuinely seems to be a good company other than minor slip ups stop promoting paladins and your card game those games are jokes and a waste of time and money smite is a gem and could become the next big thing will it though i see a bright future for smite but until this game is hires only focus time will be of the essence until this game dies out or is taken over by another action mob after having at least two thousands hours on this game non steam hours are a thing this game will always have a place in my heart id recommend it to anyone who wants to try out the mob genre
early access review good graphics funny elements you are randomly spawned on the map players do not re spawn in the same time game can be fun until you notice horrible aiming system impossible to shoot worst i ever seen in any game no real recoil just random jumping crosshair big minus nobody can play like this bad hit detection i shoot full round in the opponent head body blood spray it effect is visible but somehow he survived and hit me once with axe i have full equipment dead happened more than once equipment does not have any effect probably because of bad hit detection people can kill you with one hit even when you have full protection and you can not kill basically naked guy with fifteen bullets installs legal technically malware foreigner agent most of people are not aware or even do not know what is malware but somehow this malware foreigner agent is universally accepted hell it even act as rootkit real question is why deus even need that malicious app when steam have good updater
early access reviewable request three dimensional is a game based on the popular web browser game advent request world i am a long time player of artie entertainment since the first advent request though most or should i say every single one their games are heavily money based pay town type game and basically are just a grind est i can still thoroughly enjoy their game i love on how the developer are really friendly and really in touch with their player and i can say that they are one of the best developer out there so yeah naturally i am excited when they announced that they are releasing aqua three dimensional i want to recommend the game i really do this game looks promising since the first they announce this and i have a soft place in my heart for a team but at this current state no i cannot recommend this they made little progress since the alpha state the controls are bad its just as clunky as ever game play are just boring and nothing really worthwhile its basically just a worlds to anyone who never played it its basically just a grind est simulator made into three dimensional with clunker control animation are terrible a lot of bug here and there occasional lag here and there and what not graphic are mediocre borderline bad to be honest at this current state this game is unplayable you didst even make a significant progress since the alpha state mechanic wise you guys i mean the development are way too focused on the content on how much equipment you could put into the game and seems like didst really care about the game play mechanics the amount of content doesn't matter if you could even barely play the game its like a sea with million miles wide but an inches deep pros its adventure quest in icons bad game play mechanics really clunky control a lot of bugs there not much of a variation in game play its basically left clicking simulator graphics are meh grind est combined with clunky control its probably one of your worst nightmare in game currency story are boring conclusion i cannot recommend it to anyone because it is unplayable at its current state nor that i would actually recommend it to anyone even on the full release because their game is pretty exclusive as in i doubt that anyone could hardly enjoy it except if you've played their previous game which is why most if not all of the good reviewer here are their loyal fans there not much to offer in this game except for heavy grinding and a lot of bugs the only content they could offer is just a hefty amount of equipment and that all game play are not engaging quests are basically just a grind est kill this deliver that get a sums of money and so on and the story is basically just a common herowhosavedtheworld trope i know you guys could do better than this i understand that this is still an early access but come on there not much of an improvement since the alpha except for the content also asking for the players to spend money for in game currency in a nearly unplayable game is just insulting man
the new update ruined everything that made this game unique in the first place since day one it is now just another average iphone game for kids when it was such a decent source of soundtrack art and role playing experience with the elder scrolls universe bethesda bring back dir wolf
early access review great game but there is a lot of bugs first of all shadows i can see where enemy sits inside building i just see its shadow from outside then when a use potions without undress button potion will be lost and no effect of it and i think sounds is a little bit broken
trove is an alright game for those who like to grind it takes about three hundred hours for a free to play player to actually get anywhere near close to powerful servers can be a mess and break often but the community seems to be stable game is fairly well constructed with the expect on of pay to win factor that has let down the community overall its a meh game
first it was guns then it was hats now its well well okay its not strictly dead the player base is still quite strong but after more than eight years valve just doesn't know what to do with its game anymore and its been haemorrhaging experienced players its increasingly an empty shell in other words the meet your match update was the final straw it introduced matchmaking but only after more than a year of development and the release of over watch the latest hugely popular cartoony multiplayer team first person shooter and a game with great matchmaking tvs matchmaking on the other hand came at the direct cost of quick play and the re purposing of valve hosted servers which were the easiest and quickest way to get a guaranteed decent vanilla game anywhere in the world its also not very good matchmaking in either casual or competitive is slow to find you a game that often ends too fast in a cur stomp win by one of the teams and there no auto balance or team switching allowed competitive copies the a format that is popular in the games competitive scene but then fails to enforce the class limits and weapon bans that made competitive play viable to begin with meanwhile casual matchmaking is too structured to replace the drop in dropout play you had with the server browser or the ease of quick play while there are a couple of decent vanilla servers to be found not to mention plenty of modded servers in the server browser there is essentially no quick go to place for vanilla games anymore the update also fixed a bug with the righteous bison secondary weapon that was actually one of its key features when the weapon was originally released it was originally meant to penetrate and damage enemies multiple times redd media com which punished them for running away since it would hurt them even more it no longer does this also of note is that all of the medics med guns now allow the medic to match the speed of their healing targets something that devalues the quick fix med gun even more since that was once a property exclusive to it these changes along with the other constant major balance changes indicate a team that doesn't really know their own game or at least the grounding for its historical decisions change is one thing but this is another my theory for why these things have happened is that developer turnover within the development team over the years has resulted in a team that almost completely comprised of new blood as opposed to the original developers and their efforts to keep team fortress going have resulted in bloat and mismanagement i know they try i really do they re not stupid and its not their fault their team is so small and underfunded by valve at this point though i done know if they'll ever get the game back on track without a complete reassessment of priorities or a new team with a unified focus or a whole new game none of these are likely to happen tvs updates have been in a slow decline for a while now there been hundreds upon hundreds of new cosmetics new weapons new game modes and yet not much substance as good as the community contributions have been there is just too much now the constant release of workshop maps into the game itself even if some of them are very good and now the heavy is pro update seem more and more like the sputtering of a game that more experienced deus would have learned to leave well enough alone by now an end life phase tvs content first quantity equality mindset is dragging it deeper and deeper into its own muck sad to say the base game itself remains great if you ignore some of the more annoying unbalanced weapons i would recommend arranging pickup games with friends for the foreseeable future if you want to play though if there were a mixed rating here i would now apply it to my most played game of all time without a second thought
the only reason you would bother with a different collectible card game or tag or whatever you want to call it is because this doesn't have two player friendly coop for man games like magic to does seriously that the only reason there is absolutely no other reason to play any other card game but this one it doesn't fuck you at every turn for money its got good pacing its got complexity its aesthetically pleasing it allows for deck building in just about any way you want its system for breaking cards down and making new ones you actually want puts all others to shame so yeah i guess the only reason it doesn't have coop is because then no other collectible card game on the planet would ever be played anymore and they re too nice to do that to everyone
live always been a fan of card games but this one is very punishing to new players the short end of it is when you start the game everyone else has better cards than you and for the most part even if you outplay them and make good decisions their cards are just significantly stronger than yours so they out value what you have arena is okay because it takes most of this away but then again it seems like people get more legend aries and rares than you do in arena in almost level thirty and i still lose around seventy five of my games the only fair matches i seem to have are against new players like myself who done have an extensive collection of cards i done think this game is bad but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other players i also mostly play casual where i get matched up against people who have been playing for a very long time so that may be different than if i played ranked i love watching you tubers like can and justin larson play this game and how creative they can be when crafting decks but then i realize that its ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when i have such a minimal collection maybe in time ill get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beating players whole been around for a long time but until then in going to continually lose all of my games unless in playing against new players or longtime players using trolley decks edit invested even more time into the game and its still pay town after one hundred hours i still lose to everyone because they have better cards so frustrating May
early access review guess we shouldn't have expected anything from a game that has failed so many times before but to be met by brutal translation issues in the first five minutes was just the tip of the iceberg for this absolutely horrible excuse of a game done buy it done even try to defend it refund it if you got lured by all the false were seen before launch
this game is terribly addictive but its also incredibly frustrating to start off in as many of the reviews say you get thrown into matches with tanks and air planes with nothing but a basic rifle and get constantly on showed by campers with mightier gear with those on your team who could potentially clear these campers off doing exactly the same to the loftier people on the other team if not for the totally unbalanced matchmaking i would give this game a thumbs up this way its a big no no
free to play without constantly being bugged with micro transactions overall it is a solid game and with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together i would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details give it a shot its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it
a massive massively multiplayer online first person shooter that makes battlefield look small lasers shotguns anything and everything if you like big fights of fifty is fifty with tanks and jets then be sure to give it a try
this is a very fun game to play together with some friends it doesn't need that much storage you done need the best computer and its really simple to get the hang of it you done need to play this game two thousands hours before you re good at it its also free to play and that just an advantage
early access review for anyone looking at reviews for this game please note it is not malware this game is not malware in any way shape or form people saying it is are salty footnote or pub fans they disable comments and make there review seem legit do not trust these fake reviews this game is really fun and a breath of fresh air from footnote and pub with some new mechanics if your looking to pick it up and are scared i repeat it is not malware i would hate to this game die to false reviews is some anti viruses report false positives so not all of them are fake they just kinda are three
alamo ana warrior were you too young to play diabolo two in its prime didst like being a beta tester for a console arg do you think you are a lucky person hate blizzard have i got the game for you
ten every thirty four months a new update is released with a new league new mechanics some reworks always adding more late game content a lot to do in theory craft terms and a lot of ways to have fun of course it has its meta but you done need to follow it in order to have fun and make profit no pay to win micro transactions more like pay to storage but you got four stash tabs at the beginning and you can get some stashes whenever they put pm in sales pretty often to you can both play it as soft core or hardcore player not talking about game modes but time spent on gamete played as many hours as you see and still not close to be tired
its pretty meh graphics are good for two thousand and fourteen game barely runs choppy as audio does not play in order of events man fall down five seconds later you hear man fall down story is meh and just kinda happens lots of load in issues when i go into the city i feel like i am playing on my old he with five hundred and twelve lbs of ram going to storm wind overall its meh only worth playing now because its free there are better games out there
seriously of first off ads pop up every so often you even get single time offer things truly meant for five year old why because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about sixty seven pointers for the deus one done teach gamers stuff period free up the game a little bit give some freedom to the players of this game less ads and more of the the lore and freedom like before less offers to buy stuff for money i understand you want to make money and all but people who play video games hate ads and random popups that kill the game play i haven got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but free flying roaming like exploring berk while flying on your dragon summary its a great game but has almost every aspect of a pay town game if your kid or yourself is struggling in prev fourth grade then this is the game for you but a fair warning if your child or yourself gets too attached to this game somehow get ready to lose all your money because its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending five thousand six hundred and ninety nine to buy five hundred gems to get like six virtual dragons that last like six months not really but its of a little less than what i though it was a little pathetic overall which makes it a below average game enjoy
an enjoyable crafting game with interesting animals and some fun mechanics there bugs yeah but its still all around enjoyable since leaving early access its still been getting steady updates bug fixes and new content all in all seems worth the time to try it
early access review emma go with the classics pros combat is fun and easy to pick up mass diversity in weapons characters and possible play styles the game is well balanced awesome community constant updates and patches cons id love to be able to set my own video quality the game will run on pretty much anything doe overall excellent even if this is not your thing i really recommend you give it a shot
early access review this game didst lag even once while i played it looking at you pub premium doesn't give you any advantage just clothing character customization is way better than it actually should be i mean you cant even see your face anyway but kudos for the nice touch in there different ways to move around the map and make you play style more awesome i guess you can be death from above with glide watch the shadows peeps extra fast moving from one spot to another with snowboard and climbing pack gives you an edge at the beginning of the match and you can literally be the hospital with two legs carry tones of me packs it center now for the dislikes cant shoot with sags from snowboard and while climbing i heard that they will change that you can hear the steps of every from very far away annoying cant sneak around perhaps they should make another class that is slow without perks like glider it center but with muffled walking on medium settings some of the graphics glitch if you look at the trees and stuff sometimes flashes or textures move around does and bother much but still and last and least annoying thing all characters are asian not that i dislike asians but why limit it with only this option you can edit your dude or dinette to look half asian but that about it cant decide about the get to the chopra escaping i hate and like it at the same time people never cooperate but there is a chance that in the midst of chaos it center you can just slip through the opponents and win the match by smoke bombing everything in all other aspects nothing surprising if you done count that its free and it works more or less without flaws be sure to give it a try
a big mistake people make when they try this game is that they quit before the game even starts if you are willing to put some time into grinding through the base story assuming you done enjoy the story six hundred and ten hours and learning about the layers of mechanics you will find your home in this game and developer the developers are super hard working innovative and they actually listen to their community with major content patches being released approximately every three months for free it is hard to see how any other game in the genre is able to compete if you enjoy areas and are looking for one with complex mechanics and endless character customization this is the perfect game did i mention its freebee referee
really great game controls are easy to use or modify for personal style the textures are really nice and clean and the block selection is beautiful and ever growing the tech devices add so many options to decorate or even build with so many good things about this game especially the fact that it is free the pro key will be worth it to some but maybe not to others it adds some very useful and handy features that help with building bigger and crazier builds
early access review connection issues aside this is a very generic massively multiplayer online if you have previously played blade and soul black desert online a on or revelation online you've already played a much better game than bless go show your support there this game has a long ways to go before it catches up to any of those and its already been out for years
while it may just be a mobile port it does make it easier on the personal computer is the normal version it makes it easier on both the personal computer and the mobile device in my case a galaxy a and an a three thousand six hundred and fifty for low spec systems this port int half bad mAy
once upon a time i would be recommended this game to anyone even with its low amount of content the ability to build gave it incredible longevity much like a shallower min craft with a decent little massively multiplayer online tacked onto it but now it creeps further and further into arm twisting its player base into buying things or feeling left out their micro transaction system has transitioned from fun into extortion and i can no longer give this game a positive review
early access review lots of fun still early with this game but when fully developed damn squad or duo mode eventually would be great more arm or means more noise its hilarious
the game is nice looking and so far the story is good but in not able to enjoy anything i do in the game i go from over one hundred first person shooter down to twenty even ten every time i move no matter what graphics setting i put it on hope they do something about it i would like to play the game further but i just cant right now
the games was kinda fun at the start but when i started encountering higher level people with maxed out weapons and vehicles that when things got out of hand its either you grind for hours to get a weapon or just win games with micro transactions its bad game design and developers should feel bad the fun part of the game is completely ruined by an unbalanced system
this game is fun if you like action rugs play this if you liked diabolo two play this if you like thinking about character progression and tactics play this if you like using your mouse wheel to change camera angle and zoom in from a birds eye view to a third person view of your character then we can be friends the gem system and sphere grid was a nice change from standard rugs and i wish more was done with the bartering system make it more like fallout one two where you can barter item for item and not just for scroll scraps this is not a pay to win game but if you want to set up a guild expect to drop ten twenty dollars the only issue i experienced with this game was not from the game itself but from how i accessed it using steam the game was lang choppy using the external client from their website game play was smooth still this game is a blast and even more fun with friends cannot recommend this enough and also it is free you can watch our first impressions of path of exile here tips youth be khz
early access review wife and i bought the game unable to play together due to the fact if one of us is waiting in que the other gets stuck on the splash screen tested this quite extensively and the only work around seems to be playing on different regions than each other one thousand and ten would punch myself in the again
early access review this game has strange customization you can a just many face features but not the hair colour its really strange driving physics is kinda dull and most of the cars drives the same and this game has few items to cost mize your character and even few items in premium shop but overall its really good for a free game i didst across any lags of fingers and this is really important for this type of games

a game that could be good if it want micro transaction hell this game has so many micro transactions and pay town items its absurd recommended for those with money to burn but not for a casual gamer such as myself three hundred and ten would not play again
i just downloaded this game and played it for a little while here are my thoughts one this game is not optimized just even seeing the game first hand i can tell its not optimized and also it is unplayable right from the start the combat is very sluggish not really something that is ready for release this should still be in alpha the cut scenes were absolutely horrid they are unwatchable to the point where you want to skip them they lag your personal computer really badly worse then black desert did back when it came out even the flying from place to place it was not enjoyable i would weather have a loading screen this is my first thoughts on this game it really should not have came out of alpha it had so much going for it now i get that not every game really lives up to the hype but in my experience this game had a lot going for it if the dives really want to try again i am willing to wait for a new game from them or even fixes to this game i do know its impossible to wish for but from what i have heard there is nothing good going on with the game or even the deus them self people ask for refunds of the game and done get even a response on top of that comments on steam would just disappear now before anyone wishes to jump on me for giving this a bad review please do understand that i do know that games take a long time to make and i fully understand it takes time for things to be fixed if be wiz really wishes to make this a better experience they need to fix the massive problems that it has putting it to fee to play will not fix it it will just make it worse
three hundred hours of agony later i am writing this review on a horrible pay to win game first game i play in about a month i get shot from across the map in my spawn by a rocket do not make the grave mistake of spending any money on this game like i did because you will be greeted with ticks sniping every game from a mountain top across the map using ultra low graphics only absolute should play this game because they re the only people who get kills bad game
i have no clue why people say war thunder is bad in my opinion its the best free game out there people are really stupid to stay that the grind is long lets say you want to get soviet jets and your saying its too long your best is about tier two aircraft the thing is just use a premium aircraft or premium account yes you can get premium for free unlike world of tanks where premium vehicles cost really money or gold to convert experience points for vehicles in war thunder its not like that if you have a premium vehicle you get a of lions and experience points just research the aircraft you want tanks and it will be a faster have premium and its a faster sure you can spend a little to get your grind fast but there is also boosters that you get all the time my point is people who say the grind is long they are pure idiots and people who keep saying they get overtired and they always lose its because they done know how to use their vehicle properly in war thunder you need practice and use everything you have boosters premium account to their full advantage and you will surely get that vehicle you always wanted
early access review so i started playing this game on the twenty fourth of april two thousand and sixteen it was great the robot ranks ensured i only fought against people in a similar level to me and it was fun there was a pay to win element but it was mostly intrusive as you earned money from battling which you could use to buy the the things you wanted for you bot from a store it was good sadly this is not the case any more as of today twenty eighth of april patch the only reliable way to obtain the items you want is to pay for currency and buy them instead of being awarded cash to buy items at the end of a round you are now given crates on complete ion of a battle which contain random mostly crappy items there is no more robot ranking and you will quite often be matched with people that are so far beyond your level that you might as well just not re spawn you can still buy the things you want for you bot but to get the money to do that you have to scrap the random crappy parts that it gives you from crates but the scrap value of those parts is so low as to be almost not even worth it really the only way to reliably obtain a specific item now is to pay re money for a bunch of high end crates so you can scrap them for the money to buy the thing you want avoid this game until the deus tone back the bull funk pay to win unbalanced shat fest that it is now april
early access review this game is based like counter strike global offensive that because of the weapons and because of the settings i even named it counter strike global offensive version two but still its free and very descent so play this game instead of counter strike global offensive because its free bye it was leo wallah khz if a want to play counter strike global offensive or war mode text me
live been playing smite on and off for a while now in not in to mobs at all but smite feels like something else its another one of those easy to learn hard to master games as mentioned by a lot of other people the camera angle is great and all the maps are fantastic extremely fun game and a very balanced free to play the extra twenty on the gods collection is fantastic value and a great way to give back to a great development team
early access review this game has been adding on lots of content before the release the content gets better as you go on and from what live read they are going back to the beginning to redo those zones to make them more fun and less grind as well fun game and love that i can play on my computer and pick up on my phone when i am out bored somewhere
this game can be severely confusing at times but overall its a pretty good game live had it for a couple days its pretty easy to complete story quests but standard quests potentially take a bit of time the startup packs are quite helpful as you level up but in sure after level forty its a bit more difficult without the free packs anyways i recommend it to everyone and if you need to know how to turn on sound effects let me know laugh out loud
after a playing i still hate mobs cons servers sucks community sucks after every patch you can see huge bugs they re just like another teammate you eventually learn to love them pros all the gods are broken here that balanced third person mob nice characters concept based on mythologies different game mode warning addictive as almost all the mobs server really sucks do something with the servers accident reviewed as this review helpful or maybe even not helpful either way join this group for more free keys and reviews weekly steam group accident reviewed
this game is unbelievable and mfg i love this game to death like i want to play it two hundred and forty seven but i have school and this computer in use in really not meant for gaming but i wish i can have a great computer and i highly recommend this game to other people who are a rpm both player
it would be a solid air combat simulator however the fact that this game is tagged as free to play just triggers me you cant do ninety nine of the things in the game without paying this is just ridiculous if you are going to make me pay for all the planes in the game why not just put a price to the game itself of right because this way the developers can charge up to sixty for a single module the pitcher three is cheaper than that and it is a whole game charging sixty for a single plane is just the dirtiest pay town i have ever seen in my entire life ten
best game to play with friends you can ruin them emotionally and financially you will probably lose a friend playing this game honestly this game has more salty players then laugh out loud and counter strike global offensive combined i always wins big up to this game
load up this game play the most epic song i can think of at the time choose my no character heavy assault just the way i like i join the great canyons of india notice a zero coming my way the song is at the most epic tartlets rock
if i were you i would download it for your smartphone because if you get addicted phone version will be always with you you cannot merge accounts you can however move saves between devices which would get way too annoying every time well this game is basically in read simulator a single player pay town hearthstone with quests and ring naming your dwellers really weird names and reviving a thirty days dead guy after you forget about him recommended to play when you have nothing to do between other things as you just basically wait between outputs which brings no fun and minimal progress to the table i have three high stat females that i use to breed with the legendary male i got out of a lunch box whenever he gets back from the wasteland
i have been playing this game since two thousand and thirteen before it was on steam so steam probably shows no time played first off the game is decent it can be fun at times and there are plenty of vehicles to use i will acknowledge it does have some good aspects but sadly the bad outweighs the good first off the mods are people who are being paid by foreigner to ensure nothing bad is ever said about the game if you even mention something about the game in either the chat or the forums you will get banned the mods do not warn and do not give any reasons for it they just claim you verbally abused them while they just do nothing about people actually throwing out racial slurs and other actual verbal abuse so do not play this game if you want to be able to talk openly about it the other major problem is that foreigner never fixes anything there have been issues with the game people have been asking to be fixed since twenty thirteen and they have still never even been looked at but then again with how the mods always ban everyone for mentioning there is a problem with the game that may be why they also continually change aspects of the game that are for no other purpose than potentially getting more money from people May
an amazing sim with a powerful flight model that is aging well constant updates and third party development keeps this game relevant for years now however graphics optimization has taken a serious backseat i have a powerful rig with gtd ten eighty and i cant even get it to run smooth in virtual reality two dimensional monitor is buttery smooth mission and campaign editor is a powerful and complex tool making replay ability a grand adventure however due to the fact that aircraft may come from different developers the quality for each aircraft varies i have since bought the mig is flaming cliffs three a and combined arms add on packs on sale and i have come to realize the sheer amount of quality research done on the flight model and avionics to make this game shine going to military aviation conventions and bookstores i have bought books from the nineteen sixties is and son some of these aircraft and the information is valid and relevant the free aircraft but is a great aircraft to learn in and is still my go to primary plane it teaches you to be conservative with the controls and gives wide range of targets and attack methods to hit its also well armoured and surprisingly fast in a level dive run in so you can take some flak before having to rob digital combat simulator world is the best all around modern combat flight sim in my opinion at this time any improvements they make are just additions to this fact i have tons of fun in in battle of stalingrad and in not sure how the world war two aircraft in digital combat simulator compare in realism to that as i do not own those modules when speaking to my uncle who is a jet pilot he explained that the engine control is reasonably simplified and automated in game as most people done have enough buttons on their keyboard and flight stick for that task but besides this fact it is modelled very close to the real thing and a person practising procedure in digital combat simulator could learn to fly the aircraft fairly quickly with a training program the sim in general has an issue with scale speeds and distance are scaled down and vehicle models scaled up to create and illusion of a larger playable space and save on processing power he noticed it during takeoff as passing runway objects appeared to be moving too slowly relative to aircraft speed and it is a subtle factor to the game to improve performance may
early access review this was one of few free games that i supported by spending some money while money could bring you some bonus experience points and cosmetics but now its turning into a cheap cash grab it lost its direction when it tried to become a mob and every further update takes it away from fun game and turns it into a pay to win mess
it has some issues because of the new client but it looks really good now some cards looks blurry animation is little bit weird but they can fix these issues old version was like from two thousand and ten game play is still good better than hearthstone
early access review okay this game is great its free to play and still and early access game and all ready have more content then pub the end game is the best i love getting to the help
early access review do not play this game it looks fun and it is but admins go to their servers and give people viruses on their computer this game seems to be just a big finishing job
i done mind this game being pay to play i mean come on guys them developers gotta eat or feed their families to also its not a competitive game well it did a mode like that but that not what this game aim to be which you need to pay to get better equipment in order to win i suggest buying this game when its on fifty off sale like me the full experience is worth paying i think of it as the worlds most detailed book about firearm one thing i done like about this game is that the shooting range mode sucks the sound is low quality and weak animations are clunky and overall feel of the firearm docent feel convincing
early access review first time ever typing a review but holy smokes this game for an early access game holy i had so much fun cant wait to play this with my friends trust me its got its small bugs and what not but man of man its free just download it try it you have my word this game is dope huge thumbs up from me loved it
early access review so i played this game quite a lot when it originally came out in early access and i thought it was great it was a innovative take on the battle royal genre and me and my friends had a great time playing it i didst play it for several months not because it was bad but because there where other releases that i wanted to try out as well today the twentieth november i played it once again only to discover that there are now bots in the game bots in a battle royal game destroys the whole concept i would rather have long queue times and met actual human players than get fast queues where only twenty of the enemies you face are actual players if a two minute queue gets me twenty humans and eighty bots wouldn't a ten minute queue get me a full map of only human players i done really see the reasoning behind the bots if not to cover up long queue times you will notice the bots right away the artificial intelligence is really poor and they struggle with stairs walls and always run in a straight line making them really easy targets to hit this is really sad this game was really fun and i like the changes they have made during early access even though i think the drastic changes every week was what made people stop playing it but adding bots is a sure way to kill the player base if it want for the bots i would have probably played this for a few weeks now with my friends switch games for a couple of weeks and then return and continue to do so for a long time but with bots in the picture i done see myself coming back to this ever again November
three hundred hours pumped into this game but now in never going to play it again unless they remove this patch that is i really done understand these cancerous developers they were making progress on trove making the servers better adding tons of new content weekly and then they decide to make the game complete garbage by putting in even more pay to win or pay to not grind for hours and hours maybe even days this patch is pretty good for players that have everything but this patch is horrible for new players because you re going to have to grind for at least a good couple hours maybe even a day or two or you can pay money about ten
early access review after playing through all of the game that finished so far i must say in very impressed considering that the game is not only unfinished but also free its a very enjoyable experience i would recommend to anyone else in not usually a fan of horror games but this one really pulled me in with its self parody and clever references the game starts out very cute and innocent the first enemies in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall as the game progresses and more serious and deadly monsters join in you reach a point where you are so on edge that even the cutouts make you jump i would absolutely encourage anyone else to pick this up for a few hours of scary cute fun
the good team fortress two is not your ordinary game focusing on its cartoony graphics offbeat humour and wide variety of game modes and player classes but it will definitely put some people off if you re a person who likes team based multiplayer filters shooter video games i think this game is for you the sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals its a perfect game you are always updated with new incredible releases last but not very least a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great team play is totally free to play the great the game can be addictive and challenging if you let it the game is very fun with different characters and balanced one of the best games of all time for sure people who call this game or boring done know much about shooters to be honest each class is a really funny cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality you re not running around with an a or a but with syringe guns and sticky bombs its quite hilarious not to mention its great item drop system an amazing fan base and the community they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game the ugly there is no serious game play whatsoever if the developers wanted players to have a real serious game play they would have made an in game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends face the facts you can disconnect the current game any time you like even in man versus machine matches perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players games almost team fortress two game modes have two opposing teams the reliable excavation demolition red and the builders league united blu that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives some game modes include capture the flag each team attempts to steal the opposing teams intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base king of the hill a central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round payload one team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base team deathwatch a team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team character the players on each team must choose a class to play each with their own set of abilities and special weapons medic heals fellow teammates with a med gun that can be charged to make other players temporarily invincible scout runs very fast and is able to double jump the scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat heavy weapons guy also known as just heavy this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes he wields a mini gun and boxing gloves and can recover health by eating sandwiches pro wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close engineer can build teleworkers sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle sniper can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head demo an wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners or lay traps for enemies to run into soldier a rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground spy can disguise themselves as members of the other team and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back can sap engineers buildings to quickly destroy them
early access review awesome platform fighter for the low low low price of free characters are balanced and viable thanks to the weapons system tons of fun locally and online this is the game that i wish smash four was
product received for free got bored after i levelled up essentially got a few kills on people in the first game mode who have no idea how to play and boom i was teleport to a high level war in which pay to win players and grinders inst kill you and blow you up in tanks or planes and all i had to show for it was some semi auto rifle which did cheese all against their guns would have more hours if not for this better with friends
early access review game runs very well on my phone and tablet which i have played the majority of hours on even my inch phone is easily playable due to clever interface design the game is also synchronized between your devices and steam account presentation artwork and progression card collection are derivative of hearthstone what this means if you never heard of hearthstone is that the cards animate themselves on the game board so its easy to tell what their doing attacking creatures smack the enemies flying creatures hovering spells shooting across the battlefield not much is left to imagination as would be the case in physical card games which helps new players keep track of whats going on card artwork skews toward cartoony but not in a childish way admittedly in not a fan but that personal taste players earn cards through game play or opening packs but cannot trade with other players at the time of this review the first player versus player win of the day rewards a pack of cards this is an extremely generous way for players to complete their collection of common and uncommon cards with minimal grind rares and legend aries will still require grinding or the game play itself is derivative of mtg so expect color playing resources defender choosing who blocks and instant spells on opponents turn there are many keywords that take advantage of the digital space like war cry and echo eternal features ave modes but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until you re ready to player versus player in giving this game a thumbs up because easy pick up and play well polished presentation strong support for mobile devices room for complexity and growth now for the issues any players complain about the mtg style resource system that causes some games to be unplayable due to not drawing enough or too many resources the mulligan system and certain cards try to mitigate this but it is still there expect power screw but no worse than mtg card minimum deck reduces consistency this can cause deck building to lean toward high quality cards that are strong regardless of the deck instead of weaker cards that better synergies with the dec there is also a massive power disparity between legendary cards and uncommon commons these two points may be how dir wolf plans to players towards legend aries and how they can practically give away requires an internet connection to play even to ave or tinker with decks may
fun game one of the things that sets this game apart in my mind is the ease and simplicity of creating decks and editing decks in a painless process it is very fast and the cards are displayed very well in large format so you can read their skills abilities without having to click a lot of crap deal with popups and load times and bugs the only thing id really like to see implemented into the game is an option to turn off screen shake i really hate my visual shaking all over the place it gives me a headache and i have to look away from the screen id like to see an option available to disable the rumble like many other games have
this game is really boring as soon as you start the game you are told to go through one thousands rooms it only feels like i went through about twenty rooms because most of the time you will be walking through the same repeated rooms over and over again to the point where you give up because its so boring the game looks like a world i could build in min craft every time you make it through fifty rooms you re greeted with a elevator which takes you down to the next floor below where the whole in process starts all over again its really boring of did i forget to mention the lame jump scares that sound like my two year old sister being tickled of yeah once every one hundred floors has an enemy in which you just gotta run away from that most probably the only fun thing about this game you see an enemy run fast through about eight rooms which will repeat until the enemy randomly disappears then you re back to walking though the same boring rooms again sounds fantastic doesn't it this game is free which is a good thing but done waste your time playing it unless you re really bored
early access review resources system i thought that was not possible to be more random than is but this game proved me this could if you want to play this game prepare to put your brain off skill int required at all but done worry if you want to increase you luck you can use your credit card to buy some extra broken legendary and have more chance to win games
i i cant begin to describe how i feel what i feel is that team fortress two is dying its hard to admit i still love it but the telltale signs are everywhere you tubers leaving and hell shabby is basically a freaking battlefield four youtube now like seriously what did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed team fortress two was great it still is its one of the most unique and innovative games and well its dying nothing lasts forever team fortress two has been around for nineteen is years and there only a certain point to something you start with a sketch you expand on it draw lines all over the paper fill in the gaps but eventually your run out of space i hate to see a wonderful game die but more and more actual servers empty and more and more people go to trade idle and ash servers the game slowly kills itself is team fortress two still the third most played game hell yeah but so many of those people are contains or bartering over unusual and not playing the game is it the communities fault no a poor reflection of valves contribution and what just solidified the joke that valve used to make games now they make money is the end of the line update a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hast been seen in so long a finished map not in operation hole bound beta or tile texture re but a real somewhat new game mode but valve took it out because it was too confusing they done add weapons only cosmetics and a in cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks i would hate to see team fortress two die because so many people are invested if team fortress two dies so does the market the ten thousand dollar spender who bought the burning be miss ass was okay new weapons may but once again valve seems to be trying to please us with half finished ideas with manpower they've brought too much beta and we the people would much rather see a finished and drawn out map rather than a overpowered attempt at pleasing the people i done hate team fortress two i hate whatever the cause may be for this wonderful deviation from the rehashed in military shooters like hard line and advanced warfare just please valve as great as community effort might be it seems like your not trying please make it like the good of days where you introduce a polished custom map that is valve standards every update we have enough hats and festive we need weapons and maps and game modes and anything but this just please live gone through two game deaths in my gamer career they were fun on the last days moderators giving out planned items it was amazing but then they ended and although you think you'll be fine you sometimes wake up and go to your computer and open up steam only to remember that your favourite game is gone please done leave the ones who love this in the dust just focus on this game and give it some love may
game is eighty great tracks are polished game play is very good what is real lacks is damage modelling lascar two thousand and threes showed the world what could be done in two thousand and threes and now sixteen years later and this title cant do any better the get real mode is not real real does anyone coding watch real races i will give you five thousand to get bit right yes sixteen years later and no one and do damage models licencing i read somewhere get a good layer
counterstrike rob offensive no one likes these damn crates its a cheap pay town method of sucking the fun out of people who are reluctant to fling their wallets at free am backwards evolution somehow this game seemed to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throwing every player they can find into matches overpowered weapons no one asked for it feels like free am procrastinated so long they forgot they had to make an update so they just decide to throw in a new poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress removal of mega bots see no real reason why this was even done its as if they removed them without knowing why they wanted to or what they were going to do from there crafting this int an update free am literally just replaced the word in the code this could've been done by anyone who has even taken coding classes in high school again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around clueless trying to figure out why the popularity of rob craft is dropping faster than stock prices on black thursday removal of armoured block again no clue what they were going for here it was fair and balanced pretty much a major factor in what made rob craft unique it seems like a good third of my grinding in rob craft was to get better armoured blocks and there they go wiping days of effort its just too complicated for its own good and not in a good way you can jam all kinds of new content into your game faster than ever before but that wont make it any better if you done slow down and put time and effort into it she plus she just equals bigger she removal on limitations of gun typesetting every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time removes most if not all diversity in robots all creativity and design in my opinion that was most of the things the community doesn't like about this game its very simple to find out what they done like as several people have done the very same thing i just did statement from freedom freedom has recently announced that they would be partially fixing some of these issues such as the crates and tiers they have even stated they want to remove all ways to buy parts with real money this is the first positive thing they want to add to rob craft in a long time if rob craft holds true on their plans i will be more than happy to change my recommendation for this game
one of the worst games i have played if its not taking thirty actual seconds to do one action in eye your getting matched up with people that are far too overpowered to ever be called fair and hay lets not give you a password system because we put numbers on our cards for no good reason
product received for free early access review classes abilities guns good graphics crafting battle royal and free to play to sum up everything for a good battle royal game
well i used to love team fortress two but this new update is some people have been waiting two hours just to play a casual game of and there penalty for leaving now please give us back the old team fortress two
early access review as a fan of artie entertainment i do believe that aqua three dimensional has potential but if you were to ask me how i would rate this currently id give it a two hundred and ten the graphics for this game are atrocious for a game that started development as recent as it did advent request worlds adventure quest comply now or even advent request battle on com provide a far better game play experience than this as much as this feels like there is effort being put into it i think this is simply one more thing that will draw attention away from other games that artie entertainment has produced similar as to what advent request worlds has done to advent request although both are updated regularly advent request worlds has received much more attention over recent years in glad that a is expanding into three dimensional game development but i honestly done feel that agent request three dimensional will or should survive furthermore i feel that aqua three dimensional feels more pseudo rather than an actual three dimensional title the movement is clunky as well as the viewing the game overall int worth your installation
sometimes a lot of time you just get screwed by bad ring draws you get stuck at two to three power while your opponent draws just what they need or you draw five or six power cards in a row screwing you over its simply not fun to play when you have no control over if you draw enough power cards to play your other cards
early access review the overall game play is enjoyable and the quirky cooking theme is unique despite my former statement this game is very unfair and dull for the majority of the game allow me to explain to preface this is only from my experience if you want to play give it a try i understand the fact that battle royals have ring luck plays a roll in your success in cuisine royals case though i feel like its too random seven out of ten games i spawn out in the middle of nowhere with nothing around me except for one tiny cottage with a random ammo clip and a scope other games i will spawn in a decent location and ill end up looting six houses and leaving the area with a a pistol with eight bullets and a pot on my head the games dull for the most part due to the fact that for ninety of the a a a king game you done engage with anyone and done even get me started on the gun play the accuracy of weapons in this game are atrocious largely due to bullet bloom i do not understand why some developers add bloom as a game mechanic but its a a a a a a a a it destroys the majority of skill that goes into aiming your weapons and it makes fire fights for the majority of the time down to luck due to this bloom you tend to use a magazine of ammo on one person in most weapons with the exceptions of the my forty two and the push and a few others which leads to tough late games when you are lucky enough to have regular engagements in the game in my opinion it rewards hiding instead of engaging the weapon damage seems inconsistent as well some times i will put fifteen bullets into someone and they wont drop and ill end up losing the engagement the times ill completely rip open the guy in like three bullets i realize that there are most likely hit multipliers but nobody should need to be hit fifteen consecutive times to die its glitchy as well i was playing duos with a friends and we were going to win the game but instead the game decided to clip him into the military fort that he was standing on when he went prone on top of it ultimately trapping him and killing him this game has a lot of potential i know its in early access i will keep playing and i will re review this game if the developers fix issues and are proactive in the community looking forward the accessory mechanic was a very good addition and makes the game unique compared to other battle royals dark low studios even though this was an april fools joke to begin with if you support this game and innovate upon this idea you could make something really fun and it could be extremely popular optimistic for the future still recommended this game since it is fun but its broken in a lot of aspects i wanted to address them while giving my take on this game and thoughts for the future April
i like this game and played it a lot on google chrome i recently got it on steam and have had a huge reminder of how hard it is to really have fun without making micro transactions lots of grinding is needed to advance further in the game but the multiplayer is fun its free to play so done expect anything amazing unless you re willing to pay perfect to pass time seven thousand five hundred and ten
early access review fun and silly lovely graphics and i can run it on my potato personal computer so the optimization int that bad at all i look forward to possible further development of this game
early access review so far this game is amazing would recommend there is just one major issue i get when i que for a second game after the first one that makes my personal computer go a a a a a a a and blue screen after a while with the error message thread stuck in device driver
i played this hame before so i decided to re download it and this is what happens when i tried to run it personal computer crash one your computer has run into a problem so it restarted personal computer crash two my entire personal computer froze and i had to hold the power button to restart it when it did i struggled to get my wifi back online then a friend of mine tells me the same thing happened to him when he tried to play the steam version of the game and he says his computer crashed too i done know what the problem is and i really enjoyed the game but i just know one thing in never even going to try and launch it again id rater not risk it
i told myself id never play let alone look at the game but that was unavoidable i turned around days later playing the game thought it be boring few minutes later i get addicted and it is slowly destroying my social life recommend to people who want to destroy their social lives hear eight hundred moans and them calling you name insults in japanese six thousand nine hundred and ten would map again
this use to be on of my favourite smoothen they updated now its literally one of the worst mos live ever played do not spend money on this game many people did before the update and now the gear they bought with that money is junk because of the new update quite frankly this game is no longer what it was and is not worth spending any time on or spending money on
early access review normally never post a comment on games but this game is so fun and very competitive it been a long time since i played a game with so good input lag and responsive movement very awesome game i recommend it
early access review like to think of this game as a sequel to the previous games which were two dimensional and somewhat fun i guess and now that its three dimensional with decent graphics i think i started to like this franchise once more to be honest the graphics a rent the best but they re not the worst around and i can play anything as long as the graphics done hurt my eyes game play is good but i think the cut scenes could take some work and a little more animation besides that everything is fine they could make the action bar something similar to the one from adventure quest worlds for the personal computer version because right now it feels like i am playing a mobile game they should make experience points a little easier to get too just my opinion keep up the good work
early access review an interesting and quirky experience for me almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next of which there are one thousand some short and straightforward some longer and more complex but all being a few seconds long at most occasionally you'll be chased by monsters which despite coming in many variations almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to because of these characteristics the game feels like a very long chase sequence and with one thousands rooms to be overcome before the game is over it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game clocking at around three hours for completion fortunately there are save spots every fifty later one hundred rooms which allows the player to take a break if necessary difficult wise its not hard almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle and its entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms however the game leaves little room for error as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one it kill you if they manage to get in close enough it all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door in regards to atmosphere its a blend of hum cuteness with horror which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots the humour consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue which are peppered throughout the game play but become increasingly rarer the horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds most of them from the monsters that chase you and i didst find myself detracted from it by the occasional humour so i believe the game was successful in its atmosphere in my opinion that is the highest point of this game seeing what monsters environments and dialogue will come next all in all if you re a fan of horror games id say give this at least a try its different and has a charm to it that i believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique
early access three dimensional brings back the rotting memories of my childhood one hundred and one thousand and eleven i appreciate the my install as it only took one second best game ever a
early access review amazing game so far only one thing i dislike about solo is that when you kill an enemy they become a chicken in which they can run away and get self revived after a time limit of course like come on dude i already killed this guy why do i have to kill him in chicken form to get his stuff it just wastes time i like the idea of unique classes and abilities and that other classes cannot use a different class ability also that in order to get legendary items class weapons abilities you have to go to a forge there are multiple forges on map in which can end up being a bloodbath because everyone will want to go to the forges to craft stuff how do you craft stuff you collect shards by destroying duplicates or basically every weapon arm or abilities dropped by other players in other words i already love this game and only have like forty eight minutes on it this is my dream game live always wanted a medieval battle royal or at least something close to it this is fantasy battle royal there are still guns but they are like muskets
it def is a good game there are a few things that are a bit buggy but other than that its a very fun and lemme say time consuming game three diff game modes and they all are slightly tweaked to diff from one another my personal favourite game mode is survival its actually pretty tough i would add vehicles to normal servers on open world though i really hate having to run everywhere i go or pay my hard earned zombie killing cash to take one trip across the map like i said few fixes the game would be pure gold
truly amazing game not played a lot of it but for what i have played is an absolute marvel would like to see jets like the for typhoon and the hawker hurricane as well as the spitfire please be in the developers to do list for the not so distant future
product received for free after playing this game for two years i sadly must give it a poor review although lets keep it in perspective it is a free game with options to pay for upgrades so is it really free then i have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes blah blah blah try the ones you like done drive the ones you done like move on so my complaints a rent about the game when it works the key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows one war thunder downloaded many malware files onto my computer and continues to date which drives my malware detector crazy why would this gave try and install malware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me my question is this why would steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site two war thunder sends out daily downloads is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates really i understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day come on three the straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the war thunder server i checked my own settings to ensure it want on my side and it want but after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects it has finally driven me away from war thunder the moral of the story is this you get what you pay for if free game performance is lousy and frustrating then it int really free of and by the way yes i did pay for golden eagles to improve my upgrade performance so it want really free for me
overall pretty good game for a card game similar to hearthstone but based off the elder scrolls world so if you know that world better than wow this might be the game for you the ave side of it is pretty good as well provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you done want to thanks to the ave arena biggest downfall which i very dislike you cant create the cards that are in special bundles so of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game the reason i want to highlight this out is because they have a description for the madhouse bundle stating were added some cards that all really help balance out certain decks and help the game but you have to pay ten just to get a bundle of cards regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help main ane a competitive advantage with exclusive of cards the games fun in its simple form also in sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said overpowered cards i give the game total a six hundred and ten due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap cut revenue is always better than player experience we all know how the business world works if your of with spending money on digital cards the game deserves eight hundred and ten for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games this last paragraph is edited as necropsy gist pointed out a can use your in game gold to purchase said content above which is a good alternative it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content so live decided to change the total rating to seven hundred and ten due to that alternative
if you like sword art online this is the game for you the finest massively multiplayer online role playing game since blizzard made sword art online it incorporates the best mechanics from every mob and massively multiplayer online role playing game to exist including animation cancelling great chi cut scenes character development and the plot line is unique in itself offering a variety of routes i would say the plot is on par with the star wars trilogy in addition there are many waifs to be had and captured almost like pokemon you capture the cute grills like you would tame a beast monster on wow the game also has a vast array of spells keeping the game fast pace and complex with countless animations going on during battle would pay again
this game is the best free to play game ever in the planet fun and with good reward extra fun if a play with friends i recommend it to all of you the rank i am going to give to that game is unusually one of the best a would play again with more friends and enjoy it all the time
done play this game look this int a bad game but for the love of god done play it its all ask you just let it play by itself you think if you wait a few hours and let it idle you'll have money to level up and progress nope you'll get enough money to take you for a few levels but because the levels and items get more expensive as you level up the money goes away really quickly but hey that not a problem you can just pay for money idles and chests right that brings me to problem number two its pretty much all pay to win they know it takes forever to level up by idling they know its time consuming and you'll ultimately get nowhere they want it that way so that you spend money on micro transactions and downloadable content as a disclaimer i got the downloadable content i have for free and let me tell you i would never pay real money for it the downloadable content is basically worthless you get items that a rent even useful until way later into the game problem number three the idles you get so far in the game and you can reset which you get rewarded with idles but you'll get very few id be surprised if you get over twenty doesn't seem like too much of a problem right wrong it takes hundreds of idles to get the upgrades for them so you have to sink hours and hours into the game to even get there they want you to pay for the micro transactions however in the end this all comes down to personal preference if you re a fan of in my opinion wasting your money by playing a completely pay to win game go right a head i wouldn't recommend it live sunk many hours into and live only been able to reset once and got twelve idles not worth the time or the electricity to play avoid it please
the game is so unbalanced hire needs to nerf that same i cause he literally breaks the game please fix that ultimate cause more and more people are letting the smite cause of its ridiculously unbalanced gods and crappy matchmaking the game is not funny anymore hire start paying attention to your community or this game will die soon
it is a decent game for people that like guns or that are gun enthusiasts the game gives you the ability to know the inside of a gun very well by challenging you to put the pieces together the right way i also recommend to anybody who wants to know a little bit more about guns
early access review this game is basically magic the gathering given the hearthstone user interface treatment and legend aries that break the game downside is that probably eighty of my games have those in million power draw rates like getting ten vigils in the top fifteen cards or getting two vigils in the top twenty cards things that should happen occasionally but should not be happening with anywhere near the regularity that they do its probably the number one thing that kills my enjoyment of the game the games free to play model is pretty generous but you will be absolutely destroyed by certain legendary cards that are so rare the only effective means of obtaining them is buying the large boxes that guarantee their drop rates is it worth it i done know its definitely got deeper strategy than hearthstone but keeps hearthstone problem of one card making or breaking a game if you lack immediate removal its also much harder to narrow down a strategy like you can in magic thanks to the high power and high card limit requirements
early access review as a person who hates pub this game offers same bull sheet as other battle royal games ill give a try once a real triple a company makes a battle royal for now i suggest grab a free copy of this game while its free and delete it forever
looks cool the dragon babies a cute but i was really fighting with the controls and therefore rapidly lost interest also as fist time player the tutorial should explain what to doe i was attending flight class and had absolutely no idea how to fly until i used ever key on my keyboard until i found the right one kitty
uninstalled on my second day of playing live already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pros this massively multiplayer online combat flight sim started out fun for me live played a good number of combat flight sims both realistic and arcades so in pretty experienced with them this one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with when i first got started i was flying a late wei era plane and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches most if not all of us were newbies at this game at first it was fun and challenging and i found myself consistently ranking in the top two or three spot on my team this mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sims but after i reached level three i started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks that is the veteran players of this game and it got a fun real fast at third and fourth level found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level two thousand and forty players not only were these players way more experienced with the game than i was their planes were way better too i would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my pinky little my machine guns trying to whittle them down while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their my cannons
early access review game looks great but if you try to play in the ranked mode i have to play against silver three players as a bronze three player why cannot i play against other bronze three players so i loose almost every game sure i can get free cards from the practice games but it will take months to get better cards unless you spend a lot of money of course
i remember seeing this game on youtube somewhere and thinking to my self man i wonder how much thill cost to my surprise i find out that the game is free i went straight to the home page and waited for the download once it finished i played it nonstop now that i have steam i can now start back at square one and enjoy the game as if it was my first time ever
while fun at first this game has become unplayable in higher tier games due to recent changes its been a steady decline and live tried to push through it but enough is enough done bother save yourself from insanity
this game is really complex and complete really fun to explore the different ways to play it a lot of people claim that its a pay to win but i assure you that if you know how you can play this game without having to pay for anything sure you can pay to make it easier but if you for example save enough in game money to buy yourself via for one month you'll then become rich in no time cd
this game was the reason that i first created my steam account after seeing friends play it and wanting to play with them the game plays well and even with the horrible specs of my computer i can run it on max graphic settings the majority of the time its a ton of fun even if all you re doing is sprint jumping in a straight line balkan forth across the world in order to get rid of the clouds on the map
some features i like in this game are how the game can be played in an either independent or team dependent base way and or team base with unlock able weapons taunts cosmetic items among other things though people joke about this game and how overpowered some set ups are or how meta some items are or how much their hat is worth fortress in the end of the day its all up to how you play and if you had fun edited though the game is not as it was in its prime when it became free to play you can argue that its dead as it has an active community and player base after the whole wave of over watch killing team fortress two i am confident to say that team fortress two is very much alive and a game that i continue to and love to play
fun game once you get the hang of it lots of grinding away until you can get a really useful vehicle but thankfully the came scales engagements so you wont be hopelessly outclassed lots of tactics to learn in order to survive but even a defeat can be enjoyable you get a bonus is you are last man standing on your side when time runs out rarely get that myself because id rather engage than hide
i love creatives i have not played in ages as in typing in installing i played creatives a while back and it was great i cant judge min craft over creatives there both cool games but in creatives there is a lot more things to do also i like the way you added downloadable content packs so people can buy them to unleash lots more fun into the game
aside from the bath met symbol and sun symbol on the dice ads the game is pretty much pay to win where you fork over money to buy dice that give you greater chances to roll those winning numbers in which case multiplayer session will be brutal even those sessions where you choose no gadgets doesn't mean they wont be using the special dice plenty of times i was so close to winning only to be devastated at the last few moments of game play just garbage with satanic overtures when you run out of tokens no way to play anymore sessions unless you fork over money or wait till the next day for a lucky handout if anything at all
early access review phenomenal game with one major flaws a a king love this game since it game out its only getting better and better pro graphic is absolutely stunning my twenty one mac late twenty twelves with an i runs very well on low setting with windows developers listens to their player replay is very balance with each ship carrying their unique role not pay to win con sadly not enough players and that causes long wait time for match making which you cant blame the developer for hopefully this game grows bigger as there is plenty of margin to expand i can totally see this game being played in a serious tournament
the best online non world war two first person shooter with massive battles a game ahead of its time there is nothing like it a testament to what greatness sony made before they left personal computer games you may have to hunt for a team and some maps may be locked other than that it is a perfect game May
early access review pure banter spam buttons and hope for the best a great developing game very promising for the future there is some skill to this game but it is mostly luck and spamming for me anyway despite being two dimensional it doesn't fell flat the developers clearly care about this game as almost every time i go on there is a new update very promising and i look forward to future updates and to the developers other games id rate this game eighty one thousand one hundred
this game is truly one of the funniest and funnest games live ever played i highly recommend this game for anyone looking to dominate a server in bloody glory or to casually turn demo men into hamburger no matter your skill level team fortress two is for you
the game is great fun and an amazing game to play with friends tons of room for progression and customization int half bad either through the use of dye skins one downside is the presence of micro transactions while they are there they are not obtrusive and pay to win is kept mostly to a minimum almost every item you can buy with gold can be gotten in game for free some exceptions include backpacks experience points potions pet food and loot tier potions
idle game if you done like long term rewards several hours to days to accomplish a simple thing then this games not for you you need patience or money this is a game you play on your two screen while doing something or to relax or to just check once in a while
early access review i all i have spent sixty four hours on this game i see lot of potential but its too early to release even the early access what i loved multi platform there is some effort on the diversity of the map and mobs teleportation what i hated no character improvement system lazy dialog repetitive quests very slow evolution poor craft system some empty dungeons
war gaming is the worst company i have seen a will play with a group of idiots in this game and a will always loss game even a pay money to buy golden tanks the game matching system is so disgusting that it always sells gift bags and doesn't care about the games partitioning mechanism
early access review really excited to see how this game evolves with the time live put in so far i have started two versus two ranked duos with a buddy of mine and see a lot of potential in this the synergy is unreal
i do not recommend this game for the following reasons there are discontinued overpowered items in the game standard league new players will realistically speaking never attain these old players brag about these in the global chat and or on videos there are items with a drop rate so low they re deemed mythical grinding your off for these items is not fun at all the game is hard to get into it is required to download a loot filter just to be able to distinguish crappy loot from good loot the trading system is clunky you are required to keep an internet browser open with a trading website to get the in game name of someone who is selling whatever you want the entire trading system being outside the game is just stupid and allows players to write simple tools to gain an unfair advantage in trading however there are certainly ways to still enjoy this game after completing the main storyline run a couple of maps whenever you feel like it the temporary leagues do not include the discontinued items however at the end of each league your character gets transferred to standard the loot filters are completely custom sable which is nice even the drop sounds for specific items can be set to your liking overall i do not recommend this game to anyone who values higher time
for all the people who are whining about the game not having an auction house please stop this is what makes the game different its not like you are just buying something for currency and instantly getting it you actually have to interact with the traders now i know that this might cause some problems for people who have bad pcs but trust me this is very healthy for the community today i wanted to buy an at iris disfavour for five exalted orbs but i did not have the currency for it and i kindly asked the guy to please not sell it because i really need it but i done have the currency yet and you know what happened he sold it to me for four exalted orbs now this may not sounds much but having nice people like this helping you makes your day better also about the server issues poe is free to play and betrayal had double the players compared to last leagues launch which was really popular and it broke the records at that time and they weren't expecting that many players they also apologized for the issues and fixed it as soon as possible poe is all about trial and error even if you have couple hundreds of hours and feel like you know everything trust me you done even if you feel like its all about the ring it really int if you run blood aqueducts for two hours you are guaranteed to at least get about ten chaos orbs may
early access review its not bad its not great its not unique and its not anything new but its not bad that being said it is worth noting this game is still in beta so what were currently seeing is just an unfinished product hopefully by the time it comes out it will have more in depth character customisation a more unique combat system and vastly improved map design seriously the areas in this game are huge for some unknown reason and there is no sprint button either at least not one live found yeti haven played an adventure quest game since ten years ago when i was still just a dumb kid who didst know what he was getting into it is nice to see that artie entertainment is still alive in kicking despite the time that passed
early access review this game does not run well for a lot of people when the game was released on may two hundred and eighty two thousand and eighteen there was an outcry because the game is poorly optimized if you buy this set a timer for two hours if you do not like it be sure to get your steam refund before your two hours are up and i believe having the game launcher open counts against the time some people could not get the game to start after hitting play in the launcher but that bug may be fixed now also to report bugs and offer suggestions tips bless online zen desk comnenus if you like tinkering with in i files to get the game to work better this might be your game you may need to do that as of today you cannot edit the user interface there is not any add on support i do not think there will be add on support in the future this game is a people have cobbled together fixes to get the game to run better there have been a few patches as of today june eighteen by the game still is not running any better if you buy the game remember it is not polished it will have rough edges it seems to run better for some people who have older computers it runs on unreal engine three and direct a nine there was a little talk about upgrading the game but nothing came of that this game needs time to be great May
early access review done know how i feel about this game as of now i haven played very long but i can say i have enjoyed it on the one hand it most definitely has some pay to win elements but the starting equipment int too bad and it doesn't seem like it takes too long to get up there and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates pay to win games the early game is pitted against you enemies have grenades tanks automatic weapons and all you have is a basic semi auto rifle fortunately i discovered most people in heroes and generals a rent very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me i still manage to score reasonably well sometimes i have only played as an infantry and am rank five or so so done take this review too seriously the vehicles are solid and its good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point crack crack crack the sounds do need some work though replay is kind of clunky but no where near day or armani would recommend this game simply because its free if they made me pay ten and removed and the pay to win elements i would accept in an instant hell maybe even twenty
full of exploiters until this has been fixed top steam community ii wont be bothered with this game because when we play online or try the leader boards the times are set by people like him below was my recommend review unfortunately the leader boards still haven been fixed and the below review was written on july eight the two thousand and fifteen potential race room racing experience has as a lot of it the game is great and simulates the cars close enough or what id recon at least there are a few things missing but more on that later the races can have free practise and qualifying sessions added before the race and these options are also available in multiplayer the setup and configuration of the dedicated server is very easy these cars which in real races are millimetres apart and us being able to do the same whilst playing multiplayer is just awesome hats off for near flawless multiplayer code the free cars you get are awesome to drive and shows that effort has been put into simulating the different behaviours of the cars there are two racing circuits where one is a more open circuit similar to circuit de barcelona catalina and the other a more narrow circuit similar to circuit giles villeneuve both circuits are great fun and there are milliseconds to be gained in and out of every cornering yet to try the get real difficulty to have a look at the different setups of the cars but i do hope there are some presets to chose from the jeff raymond grand pix games didst have and see where that lead them there are however some problems with the game the first thing is that their marketing plan is confusing to say the least no need for me to dig deeper into it read the other reviews and read the guides for the game if you are to buy content the actual tracks could simulate more realistic features like best grip in the race line and id like to see different type of weather too like rain for example the leader board is a joke because the fastest laps on it are now impossible to beat as changes to the tracks have made some short cuts invalidating the lap a reset of the leader boards should be done as soon as possible sector studios are working continuously on the game and with that in mind and seeing the potential it will bring race room racing experience very far july
have you ever wanted to quest ever welcome to ever quest a game where you can quest as long as you like forever if you like a game where levelling is ever lasting and player versus player is ever exciting watch your back you could be ranked by someone ever so quietly but done be scared you can stay in towns and craft if you wanted to ever ever quest two a little bit of ever quest just with a two
it was fun for a long time but its really grind and becoming more and more pay to win as we speak the developers stopped caring about making an actual good game after the steam release and only wanted to make money as quickly as possible
smite is probably the best mob out there whilst laugh out loud and data focus on a birdseye perspective smite gets right into the action in third person skill shot based game play using mythical deities from global pantheons such as the ancient greeks the ravenous mayans or even the newest pantheons being voodoo slavic and polynesian there is a character that represents apart of almost every single corner in the world with almost one hundred mostly different characters to choose from there is something for everyone whilst not every release can be as unique as ganesha or the morgan especially with the latest chen bog being unpopular in the community the game has endless combinations of team comps and thus provides a lot of fun especially with a two week update rotation there is constantly something being added whether a new god or game mode or much needed balance balance is not the best in smite its arguably one of its weak points the meta is constantly changing and for new players it may be difficult to get into the competitive scene yet with constant updates this int always a problem monetization is strictly cosmetics loot boxes are a thing however the recent and fairly priced daily bundles give you random exclusive skins for around ten you can also earn premium currency in game for logging in daily or gem storm events one issue however is there are constantly events back to back giving no rest to a collector limited skins pop up left and right and it does get tiring seeing your favourite character get a new limited skin but not being able to purchase it due to spending your money on the last limited skin a week ago there is a lot of free items given out however you can get free items for winning games and levelling up will earn you previously exclusive items the sports side is professionally handled and enjoyable to watch with all its faults smite is a really good mob that id suggest everyone try while it can be frustrating at times hire usually always comes through and responds to its community toxicity is a problem in any game and smite is no different but ignoring negative players through the mute button is as easy as a click and the newly added commendation system encourages positivity overall smite is enjoyable and provides something for everyone despite its few issues in balancing and player toxicity pass that is a game worthwhile May
team fortress two summed up fort five pm tilt i really didst think fort five pm tilt i could meet pal more than the ones live met on is fort five pm tilt of fort five pm tilt proves me wrong fort five pm tilt every time
i have played this game for a about two years now almost exclusively outside steam i have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game general characteristics of the game the hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game it is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game you can play in any way you want some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leader boards others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt downloading this game for free will give you very limited options you will receive a weapon that only allows you to hunt one species however if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of the achievement system depends on the animals you shoot and the weapons you use killing animals and using different weapons gives you hunter score which is the basis for your position on the leader boards if you wish to have all the weapons it will cost you a lot of money however there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game buying licenses for specific species is something i would advise against if you buy membership packs you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time some nice weapons and gear furthermore this game has two types of current pm and pm the pm can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store the pm is earned by doing missions and special events and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun if you are thinking about buying things from the in game store done hesitate to message me on steam i can give you some advice on what to buy pros there are many different species atypical and rare coloured animals can be found albino mechanistic it center there are many different weapons incl rifles handguns bows modern and old very nice reserves good graphics many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters its challenging it will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it frequent updates many special events holidays with special competitions and store discounts many great people in the community a very active forum where all your questions can be answered cons it has bugs it often takes a long time before they are fixed some of these have been around for a long time server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours its expensive if you want to have a lot of gear very limited options for character customisation cheers given art grazer in the hunter
ill admit live stopped playing this game but not because i didst like it if i didst like it i wouldn't have one thousand hours in it i stopped playing because the economy was failing for anyone looking to play a game with a good trading economy i honestly cant recommend team fortress two any longer but if your looking for a kind community and endless fun this is the game for you its cartoony and classy at the same damn time
early access review garbage do not buy stay far away save your money of where to start i guess well take it from the login screen game freezes on bless screen and wont let you in you play the ring game before you even get inside the game lola ter the initial cluster fuck they opened new servers to manage the numbers but these are all founders edition pal that already used up the founder items which were character bound another mistake by these idiots had it been account bound pal would be managed the servers better so essentially if they wanted to use those items they were locked into that server and no choice but to wait and keep login back union faction was almost instantly full forcing you to pick the other translation of the skills some of the items and even user interface were garbage fps in this is probably the worst that i have ever seen optimization is nonexistent one healing class in the game with atrocious tool kit for healing so bad that even they have realized it and said will balance god knows when dupe bug in auction house a lot of pal and by a lot i should probably say the two hundred or so emissaries that feel special they were invited to hotel meeting room to see a garbage presentation which was a big red flag for anyone that saw it go see for yourself on youtube say that the game is in early access which is an absolute st of an excuse for a game that has launched three times before launching in a korea failed russia failed japan me semi failed and finally this a mega garbage fest personally think steam should to consider this a game good enough to be here and give full refunds to anyone that bought it and help us close down this game forever this company is one giant con and they hop from one region to another collect what money they can and then off to the next although i think we were the final touch
early access review really enjoy this game like a lot of course as any other game theirs glitches act but not too major a shout out to the deus keep up the good work if you like any other block game then you'll definitely love this game and even more i can personally say that in addicted
due to the immense amount of positive reviews for this game few will read this and even fewer will listen however i simply cannot recommend a game that runs at one thousand eight hundred and twenty five frames on damn near the lowest settings while anything truly important is going on especially when the specs of my computer twelve go ram fax gtd seven hundred and fifty to clearly are superior to the recommended system requirements of the game there are times where i get frame rates closer to four thousand and sixty however these times are few and far between and only take place in desolate areas without players vehicles or even the simplest structure i have other complaints about this game although in sure other negative reviews already cover them so ill leave it to fellow disappointed players to voice their opinions on the matter i am saddened by my experiences with the game especially due to how fun it seems it would be if it were to run properly at least it was free
been playing this game since two thousand and ten live met some interesting and awesome people on this first person shooter game on some community servers the nine classes are psychotic mercy but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from sam videos and the team fortress two comics the many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and stats and of course cosmetics it gives you many different load outs and play styles you could even add mods for more playability there are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the steam community market but i enjoy the community servers and different game modes payload payload race so doomsday pass time versus saxon hale randomized a ctr both control point mann is machine surf trade servers mann power halloween mode maps and much more and done forget now there is competitive and casual play as well if your interested there is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practising on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with techniques like stair stabs surfing and rockets coventry jumping although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible i disagree sure it has some problems but it has a very good community with big events like tip of the hats as i said before the team fortress two characters are more interesting and have a very crazy but also lovable personality and they interact with each other in game
early access review you are leavinggreetingfrom a place that empty is without you i see your eyes shining slowly turning into crystal clouds that show will always remember you there is so much of you that now i feel mine if there is a paradise i bet there a on wrapped in the ski know you are now you are leaving me leaving me this way thinking about how to suppress the last beat but no your train already left say farewell not saying good by the longing for you floods my void you will be present in every memory in every advice you will live in front of my house i promise would plant a tree on your name my dearest friend farewell robert street the lord for me being your friend has been an honor
early access review it was all good and fun the first week before they made it impossible to solo on a ranger which i was having so much fun on tried to refund the game i think the day after steam stopped accepting them didst know at the time got denied so now its just sitting there as seventy five free to be wiz live tried to log in a few times since but i never last more than five minutes at this point thirty two days left on my premium status but only used about seven days of it so sad to know that they get to keep the money for unused accounts that were unable to refund
early access review like it but i done is cool a poor call of duty but if you get banned from counter strike go for liked or one hour or you wanna waste some time running system sex and your first game will sex as well but when you get use whit it is pretty cool
i do like the game as well as the extra planes and huey which i bought and added on the graphs are really great and the game is really great to play a couple things which can be improved very much on is they need to have interactive training tutorials for every plane and helicopter it center i realize it is a flight sim but there would also be many more people purchasing the models and playing it if it were more player friendly such as simple to learn and use basic controls to just get flying and shooting with many people that fly things like microsoft flight sim a plane it center and many people in the older age groups find it a little over whelming to try to have to learn and remember so many different commands so a easy version would not be that hard to include in the controls people would have a choice as to how they want to fly that way instead of making more and more complex planes how about making some simpler to control ones which would also get you more paying customers as they would graduate up to bigger better planes also along with the interactive tutorials you should have better and easier ways to figure out how to set up and bind a joy stick combo for easier to fly planes it center include interactive tutorials on every plane it center especially for the basics of flying taking off landing and a little about basic combat use of guns it center make it more player basic settings for newbies please remember most of us a rent real pilots like you seem to have here putting people down who are new and trying to learn and most of us cant afford to run out and spend fifty thousand up to try to build a actual simulator and get the wart hog combat pedals track in or virtual reality it center even though some of us have things like the a pro tracker and pedals from other games
you like games like magic the gathering and hex and are happy with their format and close resemblance to their game play this is your game for there are no surprises here and no real innovation so if you want to play with new cards go for it but first first you have to get through long and boring tutorial then through long and boring artificial intelligence deck gauntlet at lowest level they only play twelve relevant spells per game finally you can play some other formats including ranked and draft about draft instead of drafting against human opponents you are drafting is artificial intelligence but you play is humans what really kills that format yeah sure it saves waiting time but it makes the format pointless even i managed to go seventy one in my first draft i was upgraded to silver rank and then gold soon and then it became really hard by that time i still found that the game was kind of fun and decided to buy the founder pack to get the campaign cards quickly five days later i completely regret the decision this game is not for me i do not like magic anymore i played magic the gathering father of that type of card games for fifteen years and i have been off magic for another ten with all the possibilities why done you have creativity to improve on the format not just offering the same game and yeah i done like merchant cards in constructed units that access your sideboard during the game i done like the mana screws i done like the sites mechanic powerful castle that casts free spell each turn ending with powerful champion nothing about this games game play is that i can really recommend and user interface it is really hard to figure out how to use user interface for some of the more complicated targeting spells prepare to get several losses before you figure that all out
a true flight sim for any pilot enthusiast especially if you are considering a military career this int a game that a just jump into and expect to start flying you need a basic understanding of flight instruments if a get an add on with a clickable cockpit you will have to spend hours going through the training courses just to know how to start and operate the aircraft systems you really cannot claim to master any aircraft without putting at least the standard of forty flight hours into each aircraft the sense of accomplishment as a struggle with one aspect then turn it into an easy task is what keeps me playing when a get that perfect point touchdown with the a then start doing it over and over a really feel like its a major achievement at this point i only have fifty hours on the game and i still feel like a noon in very confident with the a now and ill be going into the a add on next as to physics i cannot say whether they are absolutely realistic or not but i am highly impressed if a put the time into the game and really try to learn how to fly that when a get the entertainment factor out of it it greatly helps to buy a downloadable content with clickable cockpit also and i will tell any pilot enthusiast to get this game
early access review really was not impressed with the controls of the game the concept is awesome and i love the cutesy style to it but the controls are just a massive turn off for me i really wish they would have a setting to turn down the sensitivity of the mouse or some type of option to enable was for walking and mouse just for viewing uptown outright a lot of potential though
early access review okay the main problem is they want control over your win rate whats completely making me out of my comfort zone is that sometime i got the feeling they take us for more stupid than we are they have many way of doing so first they absolutely control your win loss rate by controlling the mana cards you get at the start of your game and what time you'll draw them if its not that it will be color issues even if for now every other collectible card game agreed that the mtg mana mechanics is totally obsolete and anti fun they just guide you a stu kish feeling witch is never a good experience for a player if you want to hook them to your game so if you tried to avoid being mana color ramp stuck you'll go dumb aggro like most of the players therese undo this game is not pure randomness proof you'll never epee ever draw the same no mana cards in a row this is the pure proof they rigged and its not randomness third so they have is deck type brackets if your playing slow deck with really specific cards in it you'll play against deck brake that playing either exactly the same cards or the counter brakes were your opponent play exactly what they need to counter your specific cards fourth so the mulligan are the worst you done have any kind of sideboard so if they want to put you in a situation and give you no option and just let you drop cards after cards they can sorry but for me a game is played when you have option to think and choice to make most of the time now its just some time it happen what is fun about the game after you pass and accept the rigged meta is when you actually have choice to do in talking about true choice here not stupid one if you make good choice by playing your rigged cards options or not you'll get granted by a win or a punish by loosing unfortunately i have the feeling the game is not enough focused on that side for the moment trust me its just a question of time until you get the logic of their rigged meta and give this post a like
by far the worst racing game ever the controls are terrible and there is no artificial intelligence racing only time attack modes for what i can see in the game all i have to say is go play the for a grid and grand tourism series they are way better then this steaming pile of crap
early access review put about twenty five hours into this game but now in quitting and i done recommend you waste your time eternal creators done understand how to balance cards and legend aries dominate the game they are also incredibly incredibly rare after about twenty five hours i have legend aries for five of the original and five of the expansion and now of now they decide to update the game to give less prizes so now instead of winning a silver crate every third ranked win which only nets you a rare anyways now you get two reds which each one gives you a common this game is grind city and now they are getting breeder many of their card creation is just idiotic as well for instance there is a cockroach that gives every other cockroach in your hand and deck eleven every time you play it so there an entire deck dedicated to just playing a hundred cockroaches over and over and over through copying and bringing it back sounds exciting doesn't it hey its a cockroach and another and another and another and another hey a cockroach for the fifth and sixth turns in a row this is a fun game with exciting interactions a and that when you a rent running into decks that are made of nothing but legend aries which have no limitations on them the eternal creators seem to want to take all the fun out of actually playing the cards and they done understand how to design a card game whatsoever its a shame because it was fun for a little while until the flaws became glaringly obvious and prizes were reduced of and there are plenty of bugs too for instance there a weapon that gives where number of justice power you have banked up its a weapon that does not give this ability to a creature but for some reason when your creature gets silenced it also silences your weapon which its not supposed to do think they would fix it in their three latest bug fixes nope
i done know why people are hating on this game this is a great game that adapted from the mobile version the game lags less and you can see the screen much better though it is not portable except on laptops get this game and you will not regret it also it is not a pay to win game i have so many caps and pets because of doing the right stuff i also got lucky on a lunchbox but anyways i think you should get this game
product received for free early access review never really played this game didst like it then but i occasionally had fun with it now i just in despise this piece of not worth the space on my computer or my time done get this piece of of a game i think this is the reason valve added the recent user reviews so when a game becomes you can tell
fantastic game unfortunately stuck with a small player base try it out if you like sci i space combat ships are detailed and crisp one map with different environments three ship manufacturers with distinct styles and ships sound design is six hundred and ten of are eight hundred and ten game play is a eight hundred and ten game is medium to slow paced unless playing some of the faster ship classes small player base making matchmaking take forever and only at certain times give it a go boys
if the original world of tanks its too much for you and believe it is for a lot of people this one is just right for you accessible minimum requirements faster paced than its older brother perfect for casual play you done need many hours to achieve stuff i really like this one
early access review loading screen simulator teamed up with queueing simulator and decided to hire that one guy from babe fish too you have become ten level on a more serious note if you thought revelation online had poor localization this game asks you to hold its beer spending a vast majority of the time trying to even get the game to even run past the splash screen then trying to actually get into the game then fighting past the performance issues you may eventually end up being just as confused as me when you even attempt to read your skill descriptions when you end up playing a game and just pushing buttons to see what happens not even wanting to look at your skill too tips in order to avoid being even more confused than before you kind of know something is wrong id wager the english patch for the japanese version is more localized than this hot mess edit for clarity i put in for a refund avoid until the game is patched up with actual english translations and better optimization if that even happens May
bless online i like the game and want more people to play it but at the same time i acknowledge the fact that it runs excruciatingly bad even on a monstrously powerful rig you can hit spots that bring your frames down to single digits overall i like the universe they have here and i was excited to try the game for a couple of years now since it was announced that being said i understand why players are leaving so often i feel like the game could easily be saved with more attention from the deus more focus on what the community needs fixing i done think bless will find its place i want it to but i have a feeling bless is bound for the graveyard sooner than most failed massively multiplayer online games if you want to try it now is your best chance because i doubt it will be around long i hope some day in the future they rerelease bless as a finished and fixed product i think the best thing right now for the game would be for anyone interested to try the game and then voice constructive feedback to the deus make sure they know what needs changed
i will admit i got hooked on this game since before it was on steam since the open beta actually the lore make much more sense being inspired by myths and legends and gods and the game play is quite nice i commend hires continued support and updates tho i done get the one something gigs of updates for twenty three skin so all in all i have only good things to say about the game hence the reason i cant recommend if you done want to be hooked to another online mob done play this its good its really good and that also means its gonna take up a lot of your time and it attracts a lot of toxic kids also making the community meh
so here we are i have started playing data two in twenty fourteen and from that time i have to say it has drastically changed we could have seen many updates and map changes going through the history but by time the community got worse with each update that has came since people started playing just the overpowered heroes to complete their quests for compendiums and other but data two is an amazing game with a lot of possibilities you and other four heroes are defending your towers against other five enemy heroes and you try to destroy their towers leading to destroying the ancient after that you win and you can go play another match again if you have friends that done mind to spend few cold nights with a playing data two just grab them and start having fun there are over one hundred heroes in the game so it will take you a lot of time to master all of them after my a hours i am far from mastering one of them he then there are frequent updates that keep the game fresh loads of mods official ones or community ones game is maintained and is definitely one of the best games for free you can find around i have found that the game is quite distracting or way too complex at the beginning for new players the tutorial just int enough to get you going so if you have a friend with some hours already played ask him for a help because trust me you will need it matchmaking still needs some work since it is unbalanced sometimes as well as some heroes this game is about keeping going if you give up you have no place in this game if your nerves are strong enough and you can cooperate with your team i know it int always possible since the teammates suck often you will have much better experience than people that keep raging this game is tuff the only thing i can do is to wish you good luck and have fun bring some friends and start the party overall eight hundred and ten
early access review used to be a go to game for me updates and game balances later it turned a pretty nice game to a heaping mess of grinding two million four hundred and seventy one thousand and ten for concept for execution
trove is a great game to play with your friend and to use one hundred and sixty bombs to blow up a ton of stuff for no reason bad part is the people crying about the queue they are trying to fixed the queues are getting a lot better edit again no queues for a long time
so this is a port of the mobile app like a direct port i mean this game displays frigging horizontally as it would on a mobile display pass on this one everyone either play this on your phone play yugo duel generations on your phone or the best option download go pro
early access review this game is amazing to say it is only in alpha definite must buy for anyone who likes games like to star conflict or elite dangerous also its a great price at only a seven
at first its fun to play its damage system research shell it center but later i tend to play with one rank above mine its so difficult to give some damage let alone penetrate sigh this bad matchmaking same as well as wot but i do prefer this one than the other one
this game is pure for the company to get money from the players i am a tanker in realistic simulator and arcade and i done fly anymore because stadium on planes and since you re not getting much research points i get about eight hundred role play in realistic and twelve hundreds role play in arcade simulator is a timed event so you cannot go in your favourite tank at any time in simulator also counts for plane they also got a bad system for ranking tanks and planes with a seven battle royal difference possibility so when you have a tiger one you face of with to the team is not reliable because they all want kills to get role play and get the new vehicle the tow hook for example is in game already a long time yet nobody knows about it and the spawn rape is real especially in realistic and simulator a bad system for team killers how do i know i was about to shoot a enemy and clicked to shoot am teammates shows up behind a rock and i get kicked for that accidental team kill and all i get is a loss in lions and go to the main page where i just can go directly to a new battle the post war is realm you got vehicles that did it even existed in world war two and mixing world war two vehicles with post war ones doe sent make it accurate at all not only that they also wanted to make a realistic game with not realistic arm or on tanks and planes and planes that never flew or left the designer table prices go always up and so do research points needed and now in talking more about role play it takes me at least a week or two to get a new vehicle with many hours spent a lot of people will get frustrated with all the above so they would pay to get to the high tiers for a free to play game us people are leaving the game more and more making it emptier and so they increase the battle royal difference for fast games making unbalanced game the only good thing is the lion gain and the graphics and the models and that it
it is pretty hard to give this game a solid yes or no considering there is a lot to love and to hate about this game pros amazing graphics realistic world of tanks doesn't even come close to this level of realism lots of different vehicles well optimised not as pay to win as one might think cons technically speaking however it is pay to win average toxic free to play community unlocking tanks can be a real grind game developers done know what creating and maintaining a community is
this game is so amazing honestly it is the best first person shooter game i have ever played and i would recommend it massively it int too great for new players and it can be hard to get into i think with just a little bit of tweaking to the introductory system and maybe more optimizations it can be amazing to get into just a fair warning to new players you will die a ton i have over two hundred and seventy hours on this game and i still die a ton but that may just be because i suck anyways its a great game one thousand and ten would recommend May
summary an idler clicking web game my gripe no steam achievements gives no incentive to play but for a few moments requires a mod to make the ladies uncensored ratings tale yentai idler nothing special here
love this game sort of a good cross between cars and asset to cora no muss or fuss sit down and start racing the downloadable content model is a little complicated but once you figure that out you re good to go
first impressions are very impressive drives really nice force feedback is excellent the track i was on was excellent and artificial intelligence behaves very well free to play and if you like it there loads of downloadable content you can purchase its worth downloading just for the free go i highly recommend it and this race sim is way up there with asset to cora and project cars
live only played three hours of this and it is already one of my favourite games yes it is a little weird controlling it but it want originally men for personal computer so i think this game is definitely a must have game also this game is free and for the quality game it is that is an incredible thing nothing on this game is pay to win so do not believe people who say it is because i have gotten things that are very good without paying a penny and the only ever reason to pay in this game is if you are unappreciative i know i probably spelt that wrong of its content or are too lazy to be bothered to play fore more than ten seconds and want to finish the game on your first day playing it anyway thank you for reading my review i hope you all found it helpful and bye
early access review knowing this is an alpha product usually means i expect trouble my experience was smooth the game is pretty engaging with a reasonably low learning curve for getting right into play short videos from the main menu helped the community was immediate welcoming team speak is a good pairing and greatly enhances the game very excited to see how it progresses
lets be honest the only reason in writing this review is because i need to write a review for the fall sale badge that being said i do really enjoy this game hence the twenty six hundreds hours its a great little time filler between other things i do definitely worth the only downside i think is that the packages are soon expensive for some really good items and craters edit i very much recommend this game its not meant to be played quickly it requires a long grind but the grind is quite enjoyable if you done try to force it
i used to play my a lot not as much as some but i played and enjoyed it unfortunately i couldn't always play as often as i would have liked to be good at my you really need to play regularly there are a lot of things that you have to remember crafting recipes to really enjoy the game sure there are tons of mods that add all kinds of functionality and stuff but then your dealing with mods which can be tricky and difficult to stay up to date with plus with mods every time they update the game you have to fix all your mods its a commitment so eventually i just stopped playing it at all along comes creatives the first thing i noticed was that i didst have to remember a bunch of crafting stuff or install some sketchy mods its right there in a menu in game if you have played any first person shooter game then the controls will be very familiar the game developers seem to be very open to new ideas and the community of players are very helpful and involved you can choose to play on one of the public worlds or spawn a completely private world all of your very own or do both the survival element of the game is there but seems to be less of the focus people just want to build and build and build and then share what they built with others the deus seem to be perfectly happy to provide a place and the tools to do that the game is still evolving and growing and as such has some issues little things like sometimes you can see right through a section of blocks to the caves below but if you try to move that way you walk right into the wall and sometimes the liquids just done quite act right there is other stuff but nothing major just bugs that being said there is one thing that is really starting to get to me though the critters generally i done play survival in there to build stuff and explore not hack my way through a horde of beauties so in the settings i play with friendly and sparse creatures turned on that way i can just work without getting attacked all the time except now they just walk right through the middle of everything and tend to gather in large groups to stand where ever i happen to be working at first i was entertained and intrigued when i heard that the creature artificial intelligence developer had a cat that hung out at his desk and used it for inspiration but when you are several thousand blocks into an intricate build and every few seconds you have some thing just walk right through you and the space you re working in it can get damn irritating you just might find yourself screaming incoherent profanities at them pulling your sword and straight out massacring every thing you can find i really need to figure out a way to keep them away sorry anyway the game is a lot of fun it is very easy to build whatever you can imagine the community is open and welcoming and the developers have a lot more stuff yet to come i recommend creatives to anyone that enjoys an open world sandbox kinda game
chaos utter chaos if you like large scale battles with hundreds of other players on large planets where each faction is vying for control of territory then you might like this game if you like to actually feel like you have a purpose like your making a difference in the war then you probably wont the battles are so huge with so many people that its hard to tell whether or not what your doing is actually helping you often feel like another foot soldier that simply cannon fodder and ultimately int making a difference in battle unless you role with an organized crew a couple friends or some sort of clan then its highly unlikely that you'll feel like you've actually accomplished something in this game the gun fights do get pretty intense and when your not constantly re spawning because you keep getting shot from who knows where then it can be fun
early access review freedom has continuously shown that they have no vision for this game and done know what they re doing they re blatantly ignoring the majority of player feedback and stubbornly continue to stick to updates no one enjoys or wanted in the first place they remove large pieces of content on a whim megabits game modes and the free to play model has gotten breeder and breeder as time went on furthermore they've changed their payment model but if you purchased items with real money that are now available with in game currency you where never refunded for them wow crate rewards are far too low and we need to be rewarded more especially in deathwatch and the losing team is always screwed over with a crap crate even if they individually performed very well free am seems to believe that it should take hundreds of hours to get to any sort of endgame so if you re fairly casual this game simply int for you
after one hour of trying to get the steering lock working it does work in several other games i wanted to restart my personal computer the game crashed as i wanted to quit it which led to the game not starting any more as i am not willing to download go of a buggy mess again i just uninstalled that how you done make new customers and i cant believe a five year old game got such problems fortunately i was able to get this bad experience for free
the game is actually really fun bullet reg is on point guns work well and for a free alpha game its moving along fairly quickly the only concern is how often the game crashes for people including myself its a free game in early alpha stage get over yourselves
two types of people before the down date this is going to be sick please add volvo this will be a disaster team fortress two is mostly casual it doesn't make any sense why they would add this after the down date both parties were forced into the melting pot matchmaking takes forever and i just want to play in pub servers revert the updated kinda agree
i have always loved this game i love the idea of owning my own home be it an inn or prestige and being able to decorate it lots of endless possibilities i love doing the quests crafting raids the most unique part of this massively multiplayer online compared to others the guides they are there to chat listen to your concerns and they take time out of their day to also run quests a game i will continue to play
the best thing you can say about this game is that its free and when i say free its one hundred free in no way will not spending hold you back at all that being said why play a free game if its no fun the game as most of its type is grind but that fine if the story is good or the dungeons varied in path of exile the story as far as i got was well not a story rather just a few pcs who would make a funeral more depressing and you keep finding yourself skipping the text before you fall asleep the dungeons are no better maybe the lead dungeon designer got bored after making three types underground forest coast and thought no one would notice the living up system is quite interesting using a final fantasy type spider system allowing millions of different combinations which would allow for hundreds of styles of play but in reality only a few will work for every character so caution is required as making a mistake on your levelling pathway could mean you end up with a dud many hours later expect for that it really is just a standard arg with poor graphics that even free is not recommend over van helping or torchlight
online is broken like day standalone hardly ever works and always failure to join friends and random tabs out tried everything from all sources of help and come realize this game is just poorly made the game play itself when you can play is great though but that a if
early access review all in gonna say is get ready to get mad at how to the guns are its litter lay who can fire first when your using amp and the guy snipes a with a shotgun something need to be fixed here
realm of the mad god see saying its name brings back old memories when i would play this game using flash player enough blabbering about my life realm of the mad god is a top down pixel role playing game everything i just said is like all you need to know of wait add in a couple thousand people grinding their off and may i say this community was so friendly i had a blast playing this game by myself and with friends grinding our characters away yeah that sounded weird as hell but you get the point just play the game if you re looking for something free and something to kill your time with you wont regret it yeah that basically it May
i am a visit league of legends player but i can enjoy to play this after league its such a difference that i can play the two next to each other without it being boring if the other game becomes boring in my opinion that is a good thing also best online community rogers and annoying people are really not that much around great game would recommend
its a great game but its a pay town i was going to buy realm gold but it wouldn't even let me buy it its not completely pay town you can get every item in the game by playing to get them
early access review good game with potential wont recommend though because technical support is poor seems to be no active forum mods at all no forum reply lack of support for game related payment issues will be the death of this game

live played a lot of this game outside of steam i switched over to make patching easier its a niche game it also does cost some real money to get geared up and about month for full access playing this game via micro transactions int the way to go if you re starting get a bundle fifty will get you solid amount of gear and a year of the full game they have cheaper bundles too the free to play part of the game is closer to a demo though with rotating species and in game currency its doable if you re really that broke however the cost to play does go back into the game and it has grown significantly over the years live played it there are a huge number of reserves and species the game itself is probably the best hunting game around i done know of another that offers the same realistic and challenging game play stalking and making your shots count is very important and getting a trophy or rare animal feels like an accomplishment due to the challenge of even finding those types of animals if the steam achievement percentages mean anything only about twelve of people will play this game beyond a couple of hours that of like i said its a niche game and not for everyone but for those who like slower paced challenges and a fairly realistic hunting experience will enjoy whats there done let the mixed reviews dissuade you from trying it out there enough of the game there for free to decide whether its for you
early access review eternal is the game that wizards of the coast should have made works cross platform on my ipad nexus four personal computer and mac book air with a fluid account system crisp fast intuitive user interface single player mode excellent card design satisfying effects and above all engaging and fun game play also worth noting is the innovative draft system where you can come back to the middle of a draft a week later and continue picking from packs as for the map products themselves i bought a sixty bundle for two boxes of cards i was happy with the amount of rares and crafting material i received to build new cards and decks i bought the jerks bounty expansion for ten and was happy with the campaign and the cards and i will probably buy every expansion if they continue this level of quality
early access review will start by saying i have played this game before it was out on steam live enjoyed this game as well as pub i am a big fan of both they both have their differences but i like the end play of this one better it is a huge thrill having to climb up the ladder and hope you strategies correctly to not get shot to board safely the storm is also a different twist making it more random then a circle within a circle you have to play different to stay in front of the storm but also how you move within the map instead of a parachuting from plane to pick your location you pick before the game starts you also no longer look for backpacks but choose your mobility perk at the start when choosing your location which decides how much you can carry a glider can carry the least but move the fastest in the map hiking rappelling which moves slow through the map but can carry the most sense the map is all snow the last mobility perk is a snowboard your carry limit is in between the other two there is also ski lifts through out the map the new update improved weapons movement and all around smoothness of the game i believe the biggest loss with the new update is the way you upgrade or customize your character equipment its not as easy as using experience from your games played free game for me so i am not worried about that just the action with friends and the game layover all the the game is awesome action packed best played with mic friends and scopes add me rating show
welcome exile in just gonna say this say goodbye to your good grades social life wife and kids and welcome the hours of free to play content stash tabs are the best upgrade but not necessary the rest is up to you exile may the goddess of justice bless your eternal labyrinth run May
product received for free early access reviewed it do not download installs malware with game join game find camp in house some idiot walks in does not see me shoot him eight times in the back he turns and on shots egg up the game runs well and looks good but the arm or appears to be based on some sort of random drop most games end with getting spawn killed by some guy with full arm or i have never found any overall needs work and could be good with work not worth playing as is
free is a lie you need to pay in order to be able to trade so its gated behind pay walls also micro transactions takes priority over game functionality on the development teams side and the community is more toxic than that of league of legends most people are bitter solo players and i only find some slight enjoyment in this game because a have a roommate to play with in the pay to play private leagues free to play my a a a a
fun at first and playing the artificial intelligence is engaging enough after that no different than the rest of the cogs pay to win player versus player is player after player who has legendary and epic cards in their hand unless you pay to win also you will enjoy player versus player as far as rarely getting a hit on the enemy or watch them play a few cards that dominate the match in less than ten rounds if you like that kind of frustration eight out of ten rounds then this is the game for you
one hundred ways to do the same build my favourite arg just for the customization of builds alone if you re someone who enjoys coming up with builds you'll enjoy this if you done but are still one who enjoys areas there plenty of builds on the community forums you can use as well

take pub battlefield and john cents steroids and put them into one game that planet side for you night battles are bloody amazing best non triple a triple a game in the market would wreck my graphics card again
i still cant believe this is free to play amazing game huge battles lots of plastic vehicles bases and on top of that if you choose to you get to play organized as a platoon comprised of four squads of twelve players each with amazing coordination if you find the right people one of a kind its not pts but cosmetic upgrades can only be purchased with actual cash aside from that anything that is relevant to the game can be bought with in game currency that you earn playing the learning curve is a bit steep so give it some time
early access review good easy control easy to tell friend from foe interesting ship designs variety and roles team work is important but you can still manage on your own combat is challenging but that also depends on your opponent the game int super fast paced so you done have to play like an mag pro neutral its only five a five sometimes that int enough population int as big as it needs to bed ont expect fair fights hama good luck trying to get a one a one going sector map is kind of plain ship blowing up animation could be way better bad early access no party system at least that i know of no custom control no other game types or scenarios no single player campaign screen feels cluttered environment int very interesting there should be some defensive stations on asteroids the stations themselves or on satellites that should attack you no evacuating your ship option i think if we are about to blow up we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our re spawn time sniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths maybe in a bad sniper in this game but one play through left the worst taste in my mouth long range combat int very engaging or rewarding so in sticking to close medium range conclusion despite the longer list of neutral or bad you must understand a lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later personal story i decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much i enjoyed playing it the most epic yet traumatic moment live had so far was when i finished capturing an enemy base i spotted a weakened enemy vessel and i went ahead to pursue it in my enforcer when i heard more enemies are arriving i glanced to my left and saw four yes four enemy ships warp in i said of fucking me and i was dead in seconds hah despite my most epic moment was me being destroyed i only went two with five deaths and three kills our team even one even when the other team was far more coordinated with their assault and manoeuvring
good game overall but but you are going into this with the intension of being a free to play player stop done play this game kenai only cares about money the meta game is full of pay to win decks that free to play players have no chance of beating they done balance the or powered decks and done give out any gems for free to play players to use to buy cards a money
early access review this is honestly such a fun game you can spend hours on this and not even notice you make your own world its awesome only downside that it heats my computer mac book pro up a lot and drains my battery quick but all in all its a great game
early access review no longer a must see updated to remove options bland nondescript time to play footnote with any game an update will please some and displease others but the jury is out on this update what was a clever and interesting twist on the latest rage of battle royal games has stripped back everything that made it unique and clever and left behind a mere relic not only has the class system with class weaponry been removed now you get forced into a random skin of a character regardless of what you might like what is far more annoying is the developers have decided which weapons you should able to play with meaning that often in games i find only secondary weapons and am not allowed to run two of them no longer are you able to run an heirloom rifle and shotgun or burst rifle and pistol at the crafting forges you have no choice over what is produced you simply say create gear and you might get something useful or waste your time instead of two abilities that were difficult enough to choose from the selection you now have only one again limiting your options movement abilities are now something that needs to be collected but some previously normal abilities are classed as these so again you cannot run roll and withdraw as the deus have decided for you there is no reason to want to engage and then run away either you want to go in or be a scared cat there is no room for anyone in between have been pushing people to play with me but with this update its uninstalled and i really wish i haunt wasted any money supporting them
early access review alpha build review after working myself up to diamond three and a playtime of thirty hours i figured i should give a little review for this game rather than listing every single pros and cons that are subject to change during the alpha and beta anyways i am just gonna point out the major things that realm royal in my opinion is doing better than every other battle royal out there the forging system the forging system incentivise you to stay on your toes throughout the entire early to mid game you are forced to actively look for fights to craft your legendary arm or and weapons camping in this game is heavily punished in the late game as you will be at a huge disadvantage compared to the players that actively did look for kills to craft their stuff map and circle with an average game time of around twenty minutes per match realm royal is probably one of the fastest battle royal games out there the circle actually hurts like hell in this game which means people will rarely unexpectedly sneak up on you from behind as gas camping is nearly impossible in this game the map itself is relatively small compared to other battle royal games which means if a will sometimes unexpectedly find yourself outside the play zone it is not necessarily a death sentence the five classes in realm royal you can pick between the class which all are unique and fun in their own way while certain classes like the engineer are easier to get into than other classes the variety of class specific abilities as well as class weapons creates a very high skill ceiling for each individual class overall game play unlike other battle royal games that incentivise you to find cars around the map each player has their very own horse they can ride to move faster from forge to forge which as mentioned in point one leads to more fighting and therefore low downtime between all the stuff you have to do in this game the sound effect are very loud it is virtually impossible to sneak up on somebody as you will be able to hear their footsteps or shots from miles away this in my opinion leads to less frustrating death experiences as its promotes a fair chance for each participant of the fight these points alone make realm royal the best battle royal game that has been released since has early beta and offers everything i was always looking for in a battle royal game fast game play more fighting than looting high skill ceiling no wall building bullshit cough footnote keep up the great work hire
malware well cant say much about the game played it didst like it but that just me its not a bad game though but after i uninstalled the game not everything was deleted there remained a tiny little annoying piece of software called gain agent a way loading on windows startup and not possible to uninstall i had to delete multiple folders even hidden ones from my hard disk and entries from my registry too by hand sorry but installing malware on my personal computer i cannot accept
it have an unix bug like always do after one min in game its really mess upmost of all service is so bad i look in facebook page and more same problem same at me and then they ignoring them all please fix the problem i think you have amazing game and you have more fans but this is you please do you best to the game i think this game is better if have better customer service
early access review hard to recommend i can see the potential in this but its been in beta for years but it feels like it has a few more years to go before it near finished and balance i had some fun with it and put in about eighty hours over a few weeks but id say most of them hours were spent waiting to play and waiting to spawn the thing that i done like about it is that at the time of writing this there is next to know cooperation in the first person shooter part of the game no in game communication except for text chat which is hard to do when in a battle i really want to like this game and will check in on it again in a few months after one or to build update patches to the game to see if it has progressed
of man its just soon much fun putting so much effort into a vault only for the game to crash and erase all your progress in glad i didst have to pay for this give this one a miss as even hammering rusty nails into your fingers would be more productive
most disappointing game of the year i was really looking forward to playing this but it takes forever to start up there are constant loading screens that take forever for no reason the game play is slow obviously for children and the character maker has all of about ten options
its fun it gets some points but its a clearly example for an unbalanced game to earn in not asking for a everything free just take a look at data two its a true free to play game of course a lot of up pay thousands dollars for data two but none of them can win the game by paying money i done get it the mole rat which can use page bushing juts and amaterasu while human which can stand and stare back to those mole rat with the gun in hand the arm or on body
this is my first time reviewing a game and the only reason i am doing this is because many mos on steam are very similar and most of the time badly produced and executed but this game is an exception on that stereotype heres why the game is really fun and surprises you in some categories the combat is surprisingly fun even though in just holding down a button and using my special moves from time to time the building is super in depth but it may not look like it at the beginning there are insane amounts of decorative blocks and objects to place in your levelling system is what you would expect its quite slow but if you done mind spending some time into the game to level heres where it gets complicated at the start the levelling is super fast and fun however i found my self spending a few hours just clearing dungeons from time to time and started getting repetitive but where i am now is the reason i had to write this review i wont spoil it but you get some cool stuff and you no longer are clearing dungeons to level you always have your own personal goal to do and have a normal goal too this made it so i was distracted from the hideous parts of the game and now focused on the personal quests and goals and awesome parts of the game this has easily become my most played and loved game on my steam library i highly suggest this if your into mos mAy
there no other game like it no other game can give you a true open world first person shooter its a game that will make you come back again and again unfortunately its a bit dated the graphics a rent amazing the buildings look a bit like star wars stuff it center its an old game that is still being updated to this day it lacks the style and grit that the battlefield games have i wish companies would make games like this it has so much potential for now though this is the best truly open world promo its one of my favor ate games ever also its horribly pay town and that the only reason i done waste my entire life on this game but try it and you'll love it its worth your time
more complex than hearthstone is less than mtg with a very fun meta game right now you can play it free to play and i personally feel its much fairer than is in that regard but not as generous as duels or hand of the gods the visuals do appeal for me personally but some might find it too bland i think fans of the elder scrolls franchise will be quite happy though
wanna play a real world war two flying simulator then give war thunder a go the air combat is fantastic and amazing however the game has some serious flaws one there is a soft role play cap meaning if you get a victory and like thirteen tank kills with premium you will still earn about six thousand role play this is ridiculous and makes grinding the main thing you play for horrendous two they have abandoned the air for the game which is what the game was founded upon three the ships closed beta is utter garbage and the game play is terrible and i believe they have abandoned it the new helicopters are an unfinished cash grab terrible flight models and damage models they refuse to keep fun and engaging game modes the enduring confrontation game mode is amazing but only shows up every so many months also their infamous world war mode is still in testing and in the past five months they have manage to make only very few advances in updating it i keep coming back to play this game because i have always loved it but after so many hours and money sunk in foreigner has not lived up to my expectations and i feel like they have abandoned this game
i heard about the game didst realize it was free and was looking for something to play i saw this pop up and saw it was free remembering hearing pretty good things about it i decided to just play i decided i was going to just try to play mindlessly and go with a necromancer since that would let me play at my own pace and get to know the system when i felt like it since when you have your own small army doing all the work you can take your time and do whatever i have come to thoroughly enjoy the game and would say anyone starting out should try the same because you can still use magic if you want or not and you can use other weapons or not i found that being a necromancer of the three characters i have made thus far is the least punishing because you done have as much need for strong gear or proper skill order it lets you ease into the game and try a lot of different things without having as much backlash for making what would be a mistake for another character type in the end i really like the game and will continue playing it and suggesting it to friends
disclaimer although it shows i played less then sixty hours on steam i have well over nine hundred hours outside of steam help i incur comrades up great graphics great performance game play is awesome terrible balance bad match making incomplete game full of vehicles that behave like ufos i have played this game for more than two years waiting for their promised changes to take place only for developers to retract or outright lie in the beginning they said the focus would be realism and historical accuracy but over the months more and more arcade elements were introduced and the realistic and simulator community completely on simulator community in particular is good as dead thanks to the complete negligence of developers they exploit broken content to get moneys and realise an endless stream of clone premium vehicles that add nothing to the game the worst moderating team and or that i ever seen on any game co comes to forum and said some of the most stupid things ever to the player base it looks good it plays worse then wot when it comes to balance match making and net coding it is just a damned frustrating mess that shows no signs of clear direction or intent every patch they tinker with stuff and that was uncalled for it is clear they done know what they are doing and they bit off more then they could chew patch after patch that is nothing more then content dumps most of which always badly balanced or unfinished and then takes three to four mini patches to get things to a minus acceptable level also they base their balancing around player statistics and that is why this game is hopeless in that respect gains motto we try fix what is not broken and instead break that also not worth the time update as of ninety two thousand and sixteen this game is still a pile of garbage if you are planning to give a try stay on arcade mode and nothing else so as been forsaken by deus and re is a waste of time especially re with planes you will waste twenty minutes hunting a enemy fighter so that then he drags the fight to his base and have the artificial intelligence a a kill you with super accurate fire this is not a game for those looking fair change is tank battles are more cancerous now then in the closed beta enjoy getting spawn killed repeatedly as foreigner has no spawn protection mechanism and all maps are tiny and therefore easy for fast vehicles to exploit
this game is addicting and fun and always has you coming back on multiple weekends a month for event chests and lets not forget about the updates that take place around every holiday valentines day saint patrick halloween thanksgiving christmas winter and summer events also one more thing unity port coming soon
after many years and hours this will be a timeless classic till the end of days it has its flaws but makes up for those with endless charm and entertainment nothing but unconditional love for this game its like a slightly abusive relationship
early access review much more depth than a lot of the other online card games out right now having the ability to use the whole card pool instead of locked to class really opens up possibilities you re only really limited by how well your deck and whether or not you can support the resource requirements there is a ton of single player content to help you get familiar with the game from puzzles to a campaign and even its own draft like format rewards a rent bad either so it may still be worth it if you have already got the handle of the game i have only two gripes with the game some cards are just blatantly pushed overloaded with abilities and stats that other cards just done have some even to the point that in certain game states if you done deal with the card as soon as its played you lose also the seventy five card deck size have a tendency to really screw over your draws both of these issues can lead to some non games where the chance you had to win is astronomically low another thing that a not huge gripe but just odd is that the mechanics a rent very well defined sometimes you have to play a card in a situation to see if it does what you think it will i think a lot more clear card text could help while it does have a crafting system much like hearthstone it rewards you way more often not only do extra cards give you crafting material every pack you open gives you a decent amount too every win gives you a chest that gives you at least a common card and some gold good for buying everything aside form select cosmetics with a chance of giving more gold higher rarity cards never seen anything past rare with legendary being at the top or even packs these chests can also be gotten through daily quests special events and end of month ranked rewards every first win of the day gives a pack too there are cards that can only be earned by playing the campaign purchasable with real money or in game gold that may be frustrating for some players card art is meh very little of it looks interesting and its probably because they done have a ton of space to work with premium cards are just a basic filter or some distortion bringing you own side of the board allows for some unique customization but its nothing really amazing to look at all in all i think its one of the best online cogs we got out now and i hope they fix some of the issues to make the game really great May
product received for free early access review by now in sure there tons of reviews saying why this game is bad in its current state so ill be real quick here game doesn't require premium to play however you are gonna need it to minimize the mountain of grinding that awaits and that with premium so imagine this game without it deus still haven fixed bugs that have been in the game for a long time and they done seem like they are going to the only way to get the parts you want are to either get exceptionally lucky and get it in a crate and your gonna need more than one most likely so good luck getting more this way or grind more than you would in a massively multiplayer online for crates that you then will take what you get out of them and deconstruct them for the bare minimum of points till you can finally get the part you want then do it a bunch more times cause you'll only get fourteen a lot of the weapons are unbalanced they are either to weak to be viable or so strong that they will be almost all you will see in combat now currently the development team says a rework of the crate system is coming i done know if it will actually make things better i doubt it this current system is a money hungry and i doubt they will completely fix that but if you are considering playing this game id at least wait till then however as of now i cant recommend it even slightly
incredible gametes legends has a great play style and is fun for all kinds of people its also a great game to play with a friend where you can battle each other and make your own superior deck which a believe will destroy your friend usually resulting in you getting rest but hey its still an incredible game best free to play game in this genre personal opinion
early access review my only complaint is there is no shooting range there needs to be a way other than playing to train your aim with the bullet drop off and all that say patterns and such but i like the game a lot and hope they keep improving it
early access review wow where do i even start be wiz has had more than ample time to address some of the concerns with this game that have been plaguing it for years this was by far the absolute worst launch i have ever experienced and i own arch age diabolo three and many others that go down in the history books for such the combat is an absolute joke this semi linear tab targeting combat system makes you feel like you have somewhat of a variety but in reality you'll just be spamming the same two buttons constantly when i say spamming i mean you'll hit a seven times and then it will finally use your chain skill there is an undeniable lag from the input to actual action that makes you feel like you re on dial up the user interface is possibly one of the worst aspects of this entire game there are literally games from the late a with better and more custom table is a herons call the realm online it center completely ignoring the fact it takes approximately nine hundred and seven tries to get the game to actually launch once you re in you re plagued with constant crashes graphics lag and other terrible graphics issues such as the game freezing for a few seconds just from opening your quests journal inventory or map as if it want terrible enough at this point the game wont even support its advertised aspect ratio resolutions if you choose the wrong settings on the launcher it will crash your game when you launch it the pure amount of technical issues with this game the absolutely poor response and acknowledgement of these issues on news behalf and the fact that there are apparently no plans to address any of these issues is why i cannot recommend this game and i am requesting a refund literally fifteen stars
early access review to or game was ruined by money hungry deus who done listen to their fan base of man this is hard to write lets start from the beginning imagine little baby me when i was ten finding a game where you could build robots and pit them against each other in a arena my ten year old mind couldn't handle it i was freaking out it was the best thing i had ever found i played this game for a couple of years day and night thinking about what crazy design i could make when i got home from school i then went on a holiday with my family i came back and tiers had been removed that feeling of anticipation when you neared the next tier was gone i was pretty so i took a break from the game for a couple of months and when i came back armour cubes were gone no compensation for the hours and hours that i spent farming those res no warning i soldiered on though and kept playing then the crates voodoo the crates that was the last straw rob craft was no longer the game i fell in love with i write this review with a heavy heart and little faith in what is to come goodbye rob craft
another boring free to play idle game no sound no music system requirements are way off my hardware is below the requirements an i experienced zero issues besides the lack of fun just feels pointless even for an idle game
early access review dunno how many cheaters there are but from what i heard with pub the games when we are forced to play with outsiders are filled with cheaters like the ones i did see jumping thirty feet in the air from the a a a a a a comment responses i see i assume the deus are attacking negative reviews and i assume since they can do this the super jumper had on bunny shoes that must have been a development wearing a development created item and not a lowly fodder he had amazing shots for jumping up and down thirty feet over and over if i jumped out a second story window it would damage me slightly so he must have had unlimited health yeah so region lock the game and lock the deus out the servers cd
all you do is click in this game i setup my racer keyboard to left click for me repeatedly sure you get a small piece of satisfaction from building up coins but like that all there is to this stupid game
hi guys i give this game a five starts great game just saggy some times and it has so many dragons to choose from although once you get toothless once your membership runs out i wish you could still ride him lots of good updates
yes what diabolo four could be if blizzard got their act together basically plays like diabolo two with a modern day micro transactions system for cosmetic stuff the layout is similar to guild wars one in that you have my style gathering hubs with instanced areas just for you and your group
i love the realism of this game however i do not like the prices at almost one thousand eight hundred for all of the downloadable content averaging ninety per plane ten per campaign which you have to have the plane for said campaign purchased and the list goes on the price tag is ridiculous
solid game that keeps improving with a fantastic business model with no pay to win new systems and mechanics that think outdid of the box add lots of layers of progression and content on top of solid apr farming mechanics currently the best arg on the market without a doubt
as a long term hearthstone player that quit a couple years back i find myself loving this game far more than i ever enjoyed hearthstone the meta in hearthstone has always heavily leaned on paying for the adventures even if you did have all the cards the game play just feels stupid compared to this game having the lane rune system in this combined with more reasonably state cards makes it feel like more like a strategic card game and less like a race to the face i do not understand the mixed reviews as of late and hope this game is supported by the deus for a while edit in level fifty and have many more hours than steam shows bethesda client and all
early access review very fun with a really involved development team that releases regular news and updates i got this game on the free weekend and absolutely recommend it even if its still alpha its exciting to see what they re doing and where the game is going i have high hopes for the future
team fortress two before and after the meet your match update before anyone could join a server really quick there were free sandwiches there were friendliest here were parties after you have to wait in a queue just to join a single game removed quick play sadly if you are not a competitive type you have to play on community servers which there are a lot of ads have to say the only thing good about this update is there is no auto balance anymore
playing a few ranked games every night gives me enough coins to do a few arenas on the weekends at this point getting cards i want is a slow grind but in having fun with my deck so its fine game is very addictive at first but after around one hundred and fifty hours in starting to get bored and looking for something else i wouldn't spend money on packs but i would happily buy more story campaigns
not sure if my negative review got posted was a really long one but ill just add why am i still playing this then id very tiny glimpse of hope they get this game fixed up and done right that or in just outright bored to death its really not worth the time wasting or any money
this is a game that live loved since i stumbled onto it it is an idle game but one that actually has a lot to do in the game and with the events its something that seems like it might have a whole lot more to come the humour is good and plays off of a lot of things the progression is interesting with both specific challenges to push you further and the general free play ones that just let you move forward in other ways this game keeps me playing daily for over a year now with several thousand hours in
early access review as you can see i have sank some time into this game so i hope you will put some stock in this review done bother to play this game they have a pay to win module that you can circumvent by regular play but it is an incredibly slow grind i enjoyed this game before this latest couple of patches i cant stand it anymore though i played medic when i first got the game and you were a welcome addition to any team a while back they gave stupid fast regent if out of combat for ten seconds and that eliminated the need for a medic because people just run away heal and come back i moved to plasma launchers which were a mass shot of exploding projectiles absolutely crap against nimble enemies high speed cars or jet flyers but anyone caught in the artillery like blast was doom sauced it got turned into a rapid fire mini explosive that does next to nothing for damage i cant play this game anymore good luck to those that can but i cant be stuffed to even keep it installed anymore
well i used to play fallout shelter on my phone but all it ended up being is one death law attack after another so i deleted the game so i decided to try the personal computer version and once again once you have a population of seventy every time you log in it is a death law attack followed by a raider attack followed by a mutant attack all right after logging in it has happened three times in a row after logging in and you spend the next thirty minutes trying to get the vault back in order each time it also make no difference what level your vault door is they just walk right through it so that is a waste of caps to even upgrade it the personal computer version will now get deleted since it int any fun trying to build up a vault if all you do is rebuild revive or repopulate after every log in
i have never heard of the new a before it coming out on steam and tried it out for the first time yesterday first off i want to say this game is free meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to reviews you should play it and see if you like it or not for a free game its actually alright there are no pay to win elements what so ever except being able to buy premium which is like unturned premium yes you can buy beds and ammo for real life money but you can also do so with in game money which is easy to get in my three hours i have well over one hundred and fifty grand which is more than twenty dollars can buy this game is mainly player versus player with beds that have cool downs to use during fight barricades to block off bullets and a sweet arcade feel for combat that is not realistic at all killing zombies is quite rewarding as well and there is a skill gap in this game you can find clans that go in together and run parts of the map on servers so skilled gamers will enjoy this game remember this int a survival game but a shooter with zombies where you find loot like beds arm or guns it center and then go to player versus player that the whole game but it is fun to play and free all negative reviewers are in stupid or are rating this way to harshly overall seven hundred and ten fun to play with friends every now and then and free
not really very good when you shoot a guy thirty four times and he doesn't die because hes spent hours longer than you its not a good first person shooter what sort of advanced kevlar does this guy have that allows him to take thirty four thirty caliper bullets to the chest turn around and shoot me with his sub machine gun play team fortress for the realism is heroes generals its not really worth the time
in duel links kenai really has thought about what makes a great mobile game and how to make yugo work on mobile its also gone about creating a game that has massive room for expansion and as such will hopefully be around for a long time to come duel links is even extremely generous with its in game currency meaning most players will find themselves never having to spend to acquire new cards or to enjoy the game to its fullest if you love yugo this is an easy recommendation however even if you don to then this is the perfect card game experience one wrapped within some of the best presentation you all ever see
after playing this game since two thousand and fourteen i have to say that i love this game dearly this game has a lot to offer as an first person shooter possibly the best first person shooter for personal computer not only that but this game takes skill a lot of it so overall this is a fantastic game and i highly recommend it
its a good game if or willing to grind hours for cards or if a have a smartphone that has gas free just need something to do while waiting for the in bus that probably doesn't even come
early access review old school style massively multiplayer online with an interesting tab target system live never seen before has some optimization issues and a little ruff around the edges but a decent game from what live seen its not the great game ever but its fair if you were to divide all the mos into good or bad bless would be on the good side id recommend with the warning that its still sorting itself out
if you love outstanding physics intense tank battles realistic mechanics and incredible game play then you came to the wrong game welcome to war thunder please insert money to continue for some reason the developers seem to think russia and germany won wii as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil moustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen live done my best to enjoy this game but through the constant aneurysms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing its somewhat impossible to do so live seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble twelve year old box live children angry they cant get a kill however done take this review as such the game requires some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable if you enjoy watching paint dry then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research but have no fear the waiting does not end there as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching but if that doesn't tickle your belly button then done worry i have more good news those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you re matched against who seem to be far above your level so the excitement of researching a bad tank is short lived as you re eiffel towered by tanks three ranks above you or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the pay two win tanks this includes having to take fifty shots at a single tank to get a penetration but if you drive over a rock prepare to spend fifty seconds to repair but the greatest part about war thunder is their servers plenty of ping to go around the developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of end or as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map however if you do pay for premium your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research of crap i ran out of premium already as their system charges you by day instead of the typical monthly payment be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your personal computer to keep your benefits coming because the moment they run out the game progresses slower than an african sloth trying to climb mount everest so grab your friends but not more than three because they limit your squad to four people and huff some glue because the amount of brain cells you'll sacrifice lose from doing that is minuscule to the amount you'll lose to broken physics monkey run match making and confusing deaths walls done wall properly in this game i recommend a spare keyboard as you'll most likely bash your face against the keys a few times

in just straight done with this game totally done here is the list why hackers even though the forums will deny up and down that they have seen a hacker in game for nigh two years or so they exist id almost bet the deniers are hackers when someone can take a machine gun one that should have the worst recoil and accuracy at distance and fires at a full speed moving jeep and one shots the full health gunner with heavy set medal at gold with a head shot from clearly away from easy sight the likelihood of that just being a really skilled player is slim to none its totally is development bias the developers have a clear bias for certain factions regularly when a update comes out its for the german or soviet faction never the allied go ahead take a look find the last time they announced any kind of weapon or vehicle update highlighting something for the allied faction if you find it id bet its all the way back in early days of production and with that bias comes unbalanced factions you will regularly hear any allied player complain about being one shot with a fewer in the chest and yet it is one hundred impossible for any allied gun to return that favor the amount of pure damage guns outside of the allied faction can deal is unbelievable its ridiculous and makes the game completely impossible hell you cant even get a decent scope for a sniper vehicles all have this same problem allied arm or is weak in comparison last i checked that not how the war went this used to not be as much of a problem a long while back when you could buy the weapons the enemy faction had as your starting weapon well they took that right the fuck out now there is just a wall of bullets you better hope you can get around deus just done care the deus are just cold and uncaring i had an issue where they did a big update and it wiped out all of my experience points for my sniping gun i made a support ticket i think i waited three months till i actually heard something back by then i had uninstalled the game the deus response of yeah we will fix that in a rolling patch later heres a came skin for your trouble of and the only unlocked it i still had to buy it with in game money this game should be ripped from steam just look at the mixed reviews even hardcore vets of this game are just done with the nonsense done waste your life on this soon to be washed up studio and their cut rate biased game
this is such a good game i done even have two hours played yet but i am already a quadrillion leone thing that is annoying is that the amount of coins i need for my first gem is rapidly going up faster than my production rate and i done know why but if you are looking for a good free game to download then get this
the best thing about this massively multiplayer online is that you can totally ignore other people and play it as a single player game this may also be its greatest drawback as there seem to be few opportunities for the social interactions that give other mos a sense of story and belonging the most standout feature of realm of the mad god is its perm death system but once you get deeper into it it turns out that it doesn't actually have perm death rather than building up the character you are playing as realm of the mad god is actually about levelling up the little pokemon who follow you around the really good pokemon pets whatever we know they re all actually pokemon are the ones that heal you and the best class to play as would be the necromancer whose attacks not only effectively damage enemies but also effectively heal your character once having unlocked the necromancer why would anyone play roth as any other class rots class system suffers from the same problem as final fantasy is job system there are a few kick ass jobs you max out before too long and then a whole bunch of useless jobs you done really need to bother with because what they offer is either too similar to what you've already got or else so specialized that they can rarely be utilized effectively anyway i cant recommend this as an massively multiplayer online role playing game but i can recommend it as a casual game if you've got an audio book to get through and want something mindless to grind away at while listening then realm of the mad god is the perfect massively multiplayer online role playing game for you just ignore other players get some healing pokemon and be a necromancer may
worlds okay st mob edit i quit the game and uninstalled beware the community is cancer worse most of the time you'll be fighting your teammates in the chat rather than enemy gods on the field mute everyone and you'll be fine
early access review have no idea why the development released this game in this state its broken period weapons are not balanced servers are extremely saggy the only redeeming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disadvantage was this game fun yes it was does that mean its a good game name mathis game makes me think of counterstrike and cod had a baby and somehow that god awful game combat arms also came in it plays a lot like counterstrike you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points but the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so saggy you cant ever get a kill not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights there is only one us server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap now done get me wrong i did enjoy some of the matches but its hard to denied this game has a lot of flaws that quite honestly are unease table the maps feel bland you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action spawn camping is another big problem if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped sound the game tends to be glitchy at times the guns also done sound all that amazing the music you here when you start up the game is nice but after that is all guns and that fine if the guns were nice to hear community with this being a pure online based game i have to a dress community the community is there but its not booming i haven seen too much hacker name calling while in a game as of late but when the game was first released it was something you saw all free or payment is game does feature a store so the development can get a little cash dollar but there no guns moor anything that would make it pay two win what is there is slight cosmetic gear such as face pain and masks graphics the graphics are not anything new exciting or all that special but they are not the worst i can deal with the graphics if the game play is good final verdict this game is fun and with more work could be great but at its current state i just cant recommend it the only way i would recommend this game is if there was some way to host your own server games and let others join that would at least help with the god awful connection quality of the current servers the final verdict is a thirty seven thousand five hundred and fifty okay
this game is everything you would ever want in a video game a story of clicking on anime waifs death redemption and overall a story of romance when i first downloaded this game i expected nothing but after playing this game has changed my views on life i can walk on water i can fly and best of all i can love again out of ten this game will forever change you
early access review funny to think that a free to play can be so much more responsive pretty graphically speaking and better developed all around than a game like pub which might not be saying much considering pub is a piece of garbage anyways this should hold out until blackout releases and hey holes its free
i would recommend this game if you know at least the basics of flight and how to fly a plane but going in blind and using the tutorials that a rent helpful at all make this game a nightmare remembering the controls is almost as difficult as flying the planes themselves
early access review today i will make a review that i hope wont bother you too much this game is one of the most special games i have ever played on my personal computer the mechanics of the game i stunning as well as the graphics which are well optimised for and gnu now that sound good i guess the problem is find with the game is the lack of realism and the control of the ships you should have the spaceship is stunning but the interaction with other ships and the outer pace environment is not that great the memories are too easy to avoid and they are too big maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship now the next part is of course the game play now this is interesting because it was difficult for me to decide first of the loading times to find players is ridiculous but understandable for a game that is not a hit yet the interface inside a battleship match is not as user friendly as you might expect but it is okay the game is actually not boring at all but fun as heck you can enjoy one game of fractured space and it will feel like you played for ten hours this is good for those gamers who done have more time than one hour a day to play games now last problem i have is with people that are ask there should be a system that bans them after they re kicked from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour i would say that this game is worth playing you can enjoy the game without putting a penny in buying the great editions of the game i would give this game a six hundred and ten this is pretty good score for a free to play game enjoy the game and thank you for taking your time to read this
product received for free early access review after the recent update all obtainable robot parts come from crates which is purely chance i got a legendary yellow weapon from a rusted crate and live never gotten above a blue from gold or higher crates its bull parts done sell for enough to make obtaining things in a reasonable amount of time remotely possible i started playing with a lvi eighty eight promo code and luckily i had lots of good stuff from this patch but for new players it will take them months of nonstop play every day to get anything good and its unbalanced as hell
infestation the new a seems good in not a pro in survival up games but heres my review title infestation the new a developer freda is about publisher overpowered productions lac freda is about release twenty two november twenty sixteen graphics three dimensional genre player versus player price free play rating six hundred and ten the game this game is an open world zombie survival massively multiplayer online with a heavy focus on player versus player infestation the new a is an official rendition of infestation survivor stories a zombie apocalypse survival massively multiplayer online player versus player game as its predecessor it is set in colorado and california the new a is the third edition of a zombie survival game that has been released several times game play infestation have a large open world map where you can explore abandoned towns and cities and trek through desolate mountaintops and national parks while scavenging for supplies the graphics seems pretty nice they seemed soft and work well with the other players and zombies the new a offers beginner and warmup servers so new players can more easily get acclimated to the harsh environment or you can try your luck on battle royal servers pitting a number of survivors against each other in close quarters death matches community features make it easy to find your friends and you can create a clan for safety in numbers you need to be prepared to engage in action packed player versus player almost anywhere in the map arm yourself with a variety of weapons from sniper rifles to frying pans its easy to get a gun in a few minutes i got three while i played the game runs well and i didst see any problem just some fps oscillation but nothing too big this leads me to think that the game is relatively well optimized bug aspects need to be improved however there are some bugs a a sometimes there are crashes of updating the scenario or characters the items go beyond the walls which for me is severe because it can compromise a whole game someone can be discovered in a hiding place because of this needs a quick fix one thing i didst realize is how the character runs so slow there are a lot of zombies and you run slowly and you still have to slow down to regain stamina this could be improved positive points free good interface design large open world map an enjoyable variety of guns and melee weapons there a lot of servers to choose from you can get in to a super populated one or try to go it alone private servers rent password protected servers to play solo or exclusively with friends mag anti cheat the game is protected by an anti cheat engine developed exclusively for the game negative points bugs need to be fixed like the crashes when updating the scenario unbalanced giant zombies they can stay alive after three explodes and two hundreds bullets from machine gun the world is big and you run slow and you have to take breaks to regain stamina it can take a long time to get from one place to another and most of the spaces between zones are completely zombie free and loot free so just big stretches of holding the run button watching your stamina drain so much time deus a rent the best and maybe four years from now well still be reporting the same bugs good game to play with friends as it alone can be hard november
you could get bored in an instant when a finally get or cars a lot amount of stuff or even games currency player versus player come on it didst gives a a money and no ones will grabbing all of their stuff to bag if all lost or stuff when someones killed you overall five hundred and ten without a friends it will just be a waste
name
early access review this is the first game live taken the time to review because i am so excited for the potential it has yes another battle royal but i love everything about it so far i hated the building and cart oneness of finite pub had as too many issues this is a great balance of realism and the deus have been listening to suggestions excited to see where it goes from here
when i first played this game i was a bit confused on how it works but the more you play it slowly gets more and more easy and creepy with little popup jump scares and it progresses to being chased i do for sure recommend this game only one small issue bug was being chased and trying to go through doors i sometimes got stuck but other then that small bug it is very fun
early access review the game was a lot better back in twenty fourteen but the development team are amateurs at best failure to learn from their mistakes and there are many which has been proven again and again over the two years of updates live suffered playing this game match making is appalling and punishes new players and skilled players the outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design the problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in twenty fifteen battle arena update which broke the game overclocking mechanic and reduced the player base to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times the removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together this relates to the poor match making mega bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers last the skill to resolve failure to add key features for the community like clans this could make the game if they bothered to implement it they treat the player customers with little consideration when they release major changes often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws they only care about new players who spend real money membership exists but it offers such poor value i suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the player base has taken up the offer if you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in alpha development to excuse them from any real accountability the most recent update changed the in game economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item the items can be converted into in game currency for a fraction of its price effectively you can grind the free to play model convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crate items for real money at extortionate rates they have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the veteran players this game is now looking more like free to install and pay to compete
well i been playing this for a couple of hours now so i ready to tell you what i think for the a free to play game in impressed you start off with four ships all seem good enough to get the job done you can earn more as you play prices seem reasonable the game play is casually competitive with some ship roles that change the way you statically need to think the ships comes along with your own crew that provides minor bonuses to it seems this crew is some how custom table but i have yet to get a new member the game has a reward system for play up to six matches a day every match you play earns you credits to buy new ship as far as the player versus player matches go they seem balanced and most the time pretty close or right down to the wire i have yet to play a match that i have just wanted to surrender has coop is artificial intelligence if you like that rout all in all for free to play this game i would recommend it and even think of a future purchase cause of how the game is structure to make it ends meet so if you like space action ships and a team based game then give it a try
this is an interesting concept in still not completely sure of the point besides upgrading yourself and getting allies and clicking as many times as possible also the trading card feature is odd as a free play game trading cards are only awarded for spending money in game there are not enough downloadable content content to acquire the usual half you should considering that it takes nine to earn one still it is a good time waster and it is free at least at the basic model
if you haven played clicker heroes first and haven played a clicker game then go try that one before using this one this is a clicker game that also like a tactics game it is fun too but i think it gets stale to a certain point as does all clicker games
played this game for a few hours in kind of a casual massively multiplayer online player who enjoys stories loves and exploration in not so much into player versus player so far in enjoying the game in up to lvi twenty five now and its been pretty easy maybe too easy there a lot of weird mechanics like if a pick up some special loot chest you need to pay real money to open them however those loot boxes seems to only give out cosmetic drops which a rent really needed beginning at lvi twenty five you'll start reaching the limit on your inventory space in not sure if you can buy bags with gold coins but i done think you can over all the game reminds me a bit of the old golden massively multiplayer online days its fun to play but i probably wont play the end game after reading that it will be a money pit however i may spent some on inventory space or subscription as a courtesy to the game developer since i did enjoy the game a bit i prefer subscription model over pay to win model May
early access review best battle royal game ever and its free to play i have played pubgfortnitehzlast man standing and by far this is my favourite on it has some different things from other battle royal games i suggest you highly to try it when a start playing you wont be able to stop in in addicted to it didst see any cheaters for now great game play and not bad optimization hope to see this game grow and some tournaments in future
early access review am done with this once a promising game now screwed up from everywhere i done even get what is the goal anymore its like removing the soccer ball from a football game deus are hungry for money more than they should be the last few updates ruined the game first removed robitsgalaxycashnd removed megabits removed tiers added tons of useless crates why not pay real money for the best crate for a chance to win legendary and epic stuff when a noon can sit ask and still have the same chance right five totally messed up matchmaking no words a removed the i done even know how to say this anymore game mode and now i done even know how to play this in conclusion once a great game now ruined by its own creators hungry for money i strongly do not recommend this to anyone except those who want to lose their time and money
early access review was the awesomeness construction simulator two thousand and fourteen that is what this game was note that in a tier nine and have just recently played this game to update my review i have built a mako from mass effect a hammerhead from mass effect utah kodiak from mass effect three terran diamondback from star craft two terran are mercenary siege tank yes the siege breaker from wings of liberty but none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established the weapons continuously nerved until being six feet under rewards being lowered with improvements to the system and a plethora of other problems back in early twenty fourteen i strongly i repeat strongly supported this game strongly i emphasize this say it with me strongly supported this game but with every step forward free am has shown they intend to take two steps back every time clone war so lets first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start this included the hover blades plasma launchers rail guns and thrusters from level one upward of level three yes this happened free am didst change this until seven months later when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back double edged butt or now prior to this they also made some modifications to the reward system adding a repair function to the game which put a drain on casual players tiers six and up back then what was the kick in the balls here a twenty five decrease in rewards yes both role play and teleport rob points and tech points hero zero next up was the hero system which allowed you to get the full role play and teleport from a match you died in if your team won but wait at the cost of the entire reward system getting another twenty five decrease at this point managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle and at a fifty reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day its been a massive pain in the turn up for hate now next up they remove repair cost yet yet again another freaking reward quantity decrease you getting the pattern yet done worry ill explain it in a second at this point it got ridiculous but of no there even more from intense to intense this game was always a one life team death match game the re spawned and overclocked update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused mob wannabe even worse is that they've now set the original mode now named classic so far on the back burner it can take from five minutes to three hours just to get on a match gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up but heres the final blow to the old mode a eighty decrease at this point to the profit you make from it classic is now as worthwhile as dumping your in a toilet or on a development team think that the worst part of no in not even finished what is wrong with my in keyboard the controls with any movement design other than tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask yeah that right the subtitle of this paragraph as of the to update wheels are incredibly sluggish rockets provide minimal momentum hover blades are highly unstable if you lose even one aerofoil are a disaster to use walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place and believe me its going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot and lastly the rotor blade design is sluggish as well this genuinely brings my ass to a plasmatic boil the challenge should not be in handicapping the in player give us or monies why all the reward rebuffs because they want money they want to force the player base to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate this game never did have a fair free to play model but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief and also no its not even classified as pay to win its pay to in progress give us or monies the introduction of easy anti cheat or each instead of using steams vac system which worked very well and still mostly does made no sense either they decided to use a third party system that not only people have always second guessed but never trusted and never been comfortable with you see where this is going yeah they drove off a number of their player base stating if you cant get into rob craft to play because of each that is a small price to pay for the issue of hackers trying to ruin our game the only people who tried to help fix this was each themselves as i recall and even then only under the pressure of the rob craft community which had already started leaving give us or foreign money eleventh did each have to fix it because free am was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging ass les to do it themselves aside from the matter of the development company profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place but it doesn't even end there they wont respond to criticism kindly light or dark which is why in not sugar coating this not even an ounce they wont listen to reason no matter how kindly you put it if they done like your you better be prepared for the ban hammer because they silence any and all feedback that involves any kind of actual review with a vengeance and hell this hast even ended yet keep reading this is starting to look like the rob craft holocaust shudder nerf pm to the grave now the final kick to the balls here and you might not get up from this one is the repeated nursing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff finally there the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete promoting the uncreative design of gun bricks with tank treads and tank treads only ill give an example from speedy to needy made a vehicle called the master kill bastard frankly cant put the word itself in which operated on two things wheels down force and rocket assisted forward momentum as of three days after the to update my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a treated tank and that with the thrusters on i guess people cant stand having to exercise their arms hands and fingers with the crosshair on their rail guns and enjoy the game because this actually happened without rockets its even slower than a tank believe me live tested this one the day i learned of the horror inflicted on the physics engine which i think its safe to say its nearly nonexistent now final thought lastly like i said i strongly strongly supported this game hell i even put ten into this game just for hangar bays but as of now free am has botched their game so much yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly that it is night enjoyable this game had so much potential a year ago but now its all been dried up free am has made it evidently clear they done want to take a step in the right direction a year ago id give this game a ninety five out of ten but as of now i can only in good conscience give it a four out of ten a toxic community confused development team nonsensical game play poor team play or constant nerds as a double edge to updates and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was all in the name of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this stay away from this hideous deformed child of a game you will be stricken with its godawful mob wannabe game claymore on my review in the comments section
great game with good mechanics loads of vehicles great graphics and sound the problem is that the developers think games should be work not fun even paying for a premium account and owning premium vehicles it would take you thousands of hours to get to the end of the tech tree and at some point it just int fun anymore
total and uttering garbage people running this game should just quit there jobs and give this game to people who know what there freaking doing the optimization is horrendous and the game is recording and in with my computer i have never been so off at a game client before i was able to get on create my char and then go ask for a bit come back to my computer being hacked in some way like they had control of it and the game all messed up like really plus hand this game over to people who actually know what there doing shall i also mention how it takes an hour to open and when it does it crashes constantly uninstalling bye bye boobs
i have played lock on and flaming cliffs years ago now we have digital combat simulator world and more aircraft to fly with more coming you really have to know how to fly and navigate or this is not the combat sim for you others who compare this to area or other arcade games need to get a life this is a combat sim not a box controller game there is very steep learning curve and you really need to item and do the training missions to know how to use everything in the aircraft i fly the a ten a attack jet a and huey a lot i do have many years of flight sim experience so flying them is no issue with me i do recommend this to any combat simmer that has had real flight sim flying and or is a real pilot looking for sim combat fun
early access review very fresh approach to mob genre with popular cosmetic micro transactions system absolutely no pay two win easy to get into but hard to master also very competitive and visually stunning worth trying out big thumbs up
a really great game i would love to donate to these wonderful people and spend all my time playing this game this is so awesome its such a great family game me and my sister other and little brother had a lot of fund
i have been trying to rearrange my deck many times but they were all useless since player versus player in real human always use the same bad ass decking fur air amazon aroma or what the in else that might be thought as the undetectable deck by those men this is kinda lame because it is not fun at all if you done have any cards that have in damn effects or trap like things you gonna lose for sure what the heck if they are in reality i swear to god in gonna tear down those in cards you is all should be my irritation but okay you done have to play it if you are poor done have any money to spend for the gems for purchasing the cards you komi good bye as the last time for me to playing this thrash is the only little thing that i like about this game is characters songs and a little bit of some events but for duel carnivals i think its totally unfair like they done pick the players to fight in balance rookie rank was picked to fight with the platinum who already own the in hell deck please fix for your gaming balance unless there would be more decreasing of players except those fools who have in deck bye you again a
basically same as all card games sadly nothing that different i got bored with story thankfully was fast forward on most of it i have crashing issues with it constantly have to click cards to get them to register to do anything was rather annoying for me
unless you have plenty of money to spend you cannot compete with other players check out websites of best decks all cost money or many months of playing to make one deck i done mind spending the cost of a game twenty to forty if the game is free but this game is a cash cow spend lots to get best decks and game introduces new cards so you can spend loads more within five years games like this and most others at the moment will be illegal
a great game as the title suggests its full of jump scares i cant describe how fun this game is to play with a friend who just as afraid of horror as you are pros free addictive fun to play alone in the dark or with friends in the dark cons kinda short
thank you for destroying the game of data you suck the only good part about this game were the graphics if you were an old school data player then you are better off playing league or smite at least those are free and in my opinion better than data two do not waste your money on
early access review love this game so much and i like the fact you listen too the community as well i would give this a nine hundred and ten there is a few things a done like here is the list i unlocked the grease gun as infantry didst buy it when i switched to a tank crewman i had to unlock it again which i done think i have to do since i a ready did it says tank crewman can use a semi auto rifle but it wont let me use my a grand i done like the repair system i like realism in a game but that takes it a bit far the reason i say this is because some battles a die a bit use some grenades act and at the end i can get twenty four thousand credits but with repairs i done get much back sometimes i lose money so i suggest either remove it or make it so it doesn't cost as much i think you should increase the amount of gold you get a day you would have to do one battle a day for twenty days just to get one hundred gold and some people just done have that time so i suggest you increase it to ten gold per first battle so it cuts the time in half i can feel the unbalance in battles it seems the germans have too many tanks and the soviets have to many half tracks i know you guys are working on this and i am grateful for that i think it should be like this the germans have good tanks but not much of them harder to get the americans should have of tanks but plenty of them easier to get like how it really was in world war two as for the soviets i done know i done know what they had in other than these few things i really enjoy the game and i hope you keep on improving and updating the game nine hundred and ten ign would defiantly play again
early access review absolute i have been playing this game since two thousand and fourteen not via steam because its nine hundred hours on the clock the game has been killed by the def if you are new do not bother playing this game veteran players will gan farm you as easy kills with their fully modded weapons and golden badges you are no more than canon fire even as a vet myself it is a absolute in frustrating nightmare levelling new soldiers especially on the us a side it a horrible experience and not fun at all the grind for levels and weapons and their mods are insane these days unlike two years ago where it was still manageable germans are the safest bet and easiest as they got the most real money investors veterans soviets are a second best us are mostly freeloaders boobs and are painfully often the underdog against both soviets or germans you will get massively frustrated guaranteed do not think you will come far with a iron sight weapon everything is so scoped up that you have to use a scope because everyone is a sniper in this game tanks have a massive zoom and are often sniping he from mountains i kid you not your stock iron sight weapon is a freaking joke this game has moved away from the classic world war two themed games and instead go for their own cod style interpretation with scope options for nearly every weapon even the weapons never used in world war two at all you will be disappointed and frustrated with this game period
early access review when the game first start out it is nice gun are easy to get as in the cost of buying the gun are cheap but after tons of patch this game only have one rule in deus mind give me your king money the game development is greedy fer they make the cost of gun so high that it will take age to get one gun yes one king gun well not just guns tank plane it center so a may think that after all the time grinding for the money needed for the gun mod will be cheap hell no other king pay wall so a gun cost like a the starter once the gun mod it cost around a or up if a want to have a nice one of gun mod dun last a need need to repair them so yeah in done with this crap pay to win game may
early access review this game is perfectly designed and its easy to play tho but its under the early access so we gonna see a lot of updates so be patient if a kinda hate that wait till it complete all
early access review a very solid game that borrows heavily from magic the gathering with the user friendly user interface hearthstone spearheaded the game is easy to pick up if you've come from other card games and the tutorial and puzzles are there to teach and reward those who have never played card games in a fun and effective way depth is great as well decision making and order of execution end up mattering a lot more than early tempo so the better player does end up coming out on top a lot more than in most other online cogs a big barrier to entry in a card game is cost and boy does this game nail that by the time i was done beating most of the single player content id already cobbled up two of the tier one decks at the time because everything you do is rewarded in gold or packs no daily limits on earnings no cop outs when fighting the artificial intelligence in gauntlet free arena runs is artificial intelligence not to mention you get to keep all of the cards you pick in your drafts and arenas it will always reward the time you spend on it no matter what and it makes for a very welcoming new player experience a great place of refuge for those tired of the increasingly frustrating randomness of hearthstone or those who have graduated from it and crave something more complex
surprisingly great game at least for an old school arg lover like myself for me it outperforms a main competitor on today arg market in every possible way needless to say live already spent one hundred hours in poe and it seems that this number will significantly increase over time pros dark atmosphere its way darker than most games nowadays i dig it well balanced of course there are things that are still arguable plenty of choose i mean plenty you can build really crazy character that still doesn't suck even on third difficulty real free play no pay to win at all completely even char slot count and stash size are quite fine by default game evolves over time new skills unbalance tweaks every month act four in development all of this free of charge of course cons de sync on third difficulty with ten experience death penalty it can be pretty annoying particularly for the melee char classes i wont be explaining this problem a lot here just google it there plenty info out there
early access review really like this game i have poor hardware and it runs better than vanilla min craft game it self is in early access stage has very good future and it is free dps i have experience points windows and single core cup
i would say one positive thing about this game and that would be that playing this game allowed me to learn that the only way to earn card drops in free to play games is by spending money on them something i absolutely refuse to do for this game it infuriates me to no end that there is enough of a demand and market for these kinds of no games that this even exists i just done get how people want to stare at a screen while they click rapidly in order to achieve so little let alone in a variation like this where you quickly become so ineffectual at clicking that it turns into an idle game that it tries to turn a profit for doing so little by making this into an adult game is a travesty but people are tossing some money their way that it was probably worthwhile for them to do makes you wonder why you even bother working a normal job when you can get paid to make something like this which in sure is a programmers wet dream of simplicity that about as close to being sexually interested in this game as ill ever get
it is a very good game although i think that tanks with high single shot damage such as the is or the of on their a rounds should have the chance of when you hit the enemy track by mistake for example there would be a chance of hitting the tank too due to the pieces of metal when the shell hits the tank the small pieces could be able to penetrate the hull and deal at least two thousand five hundred and forty five of the damage
early access review recommend this game it was so cute and fun at first but then i wanted to quit at the fact that the cuteness quickly goes away completely and you are left with eleven different monsters that want to either eat you take your soul or just plain kill you please play this game
early access review you cant join a dungeon with a friend even though it says party dungeon the worst of the worst stay away from this horrible game the music still haunts me to this day
its a very chill arcady game where you run away from monsters in randomized rooms with the monsters having special effects to make running away hard surprisingly fun and can be actually scary for some people
answer me this why do you not have this game yet you done even have to buy it just go ahead and click that download button now its right up there just one mouse click go ahead
although many have complained about the game not being free enough i done find it an issue at all the game is still in development and needs some polishing but the game is playable by all means and five hours in i have not seen any game breaking bugs about the argument over free to play i remember a time when free to play didst exist when it came to top notch technology games with multiplayer capabilities this is someones job to create this game surely they deserve compensation for their work do they not they game can easily be played without spending any cash but the whole business model as for any other free to play game is for the player to buy exclusive items in the in game store i cannot think of any free to play games with so many options and game types that doesn't have an in game store so ignore all of these negative reviews about the game not being free enough download and install this unique game and have a gaming experience that you wont find any where else for free
its not a good fallout game and its not a good mobile game either my old recommendation is don to bother too much micromanaging to enjoy vault life menus needed a lot more polish before porting to pc loading screens are long good god having people attack your vault is annoying category score plot two hundred and ten game play four hundred and ten graphics seven hundred and ten soundtrack ten replay ability ten overall two hundred and ten plot if you come into this game expecting game play choices like you do in fallout prepare to be disappointed keeping in mind that this was originally a mobile game a medium that traditionally lacks the ability to dive into lore there a very little to learn about the world of fallout interactions with outside characters are thrown in amongst hours of tedium and impacts on the world are long lasting this game will leave you wondering why the hell do i care about this vault again also there a no end goal so you re just grinding for the sake of grinding game play starting from a mobile game and porting to personal computer there was so much opportunity to improve on the basic formula many of the menus are very clunky and leave you clicking in and out my biggest grievance the bigger your vault gets the more you have to scroll out to manage your dwellers at the macro level unfortunately the hotbox or clickable area for almost all clickable objects in the game might not line up with the sprite if you re anything like me you all end up having a lot of wasted clicks that pile up as minor annoyances into a gargantuan garbage heap a big improvement would have been menus or buttons for auto assigning dwellers actually no my biggest grievance is when your vault gets attacked you can only assign two dwellers to guard the door and the invaders will run right past them the rest of your dwellers just walk along or twiddle their thumbs while the vault is being torn to and you can to get dwellers even the ones assigned to the entrance to follow the invaders around also during the duration of that event you cannot let in new dwellers or get your old ones back from the wasteland very irritating graphics it did start as a mobile game and in keeping with the medium the style is cartoon like and keeps with the quintessential spirit of fallout with all of its anachronisms and art influences it can be difficult to differentiate dwellers unless you assign standard outfits which will take a long time to collect to specific rooms sex all of the dwellers working in the hospital wearing lab coats dwellers working out wearing fatigues it center as a result of many generational breeding in my vault almost everyone has dark skin and dark hair they are very difficult to tell apart and due to the menu system sucking it leads to a lot of confusion the graphics agent great but i suppose they could be worse soundtrack i don to actually remember music playing during the game except small cues when i accomplished something could be a bug i suppose the jazzy classic soundtrack of fallout three and four forget it you re not getting any of that here also points off for having blaring alarms while your vault is being attacked its annoying after the first two minutes and you will be hearing it a lot over the course of the game replay ability i haven to completed this game while i do have all of the rooms unlocked and built i find the progression to be very empty its not rewarding and a lot of mechanics that should have been addictive fall flat because of the aforementioned awful menu system there a a lot of micromanaging involved and with one hundred dwellers it just becomes a massive pain in the overall i enjoyed this game for the first hour that i played it and kept playing out of a love for bethesda this in to a good fallout game and it in to a good mobile game either also though my computer is a bit outdated i have a gtd two hundred and sixty in my box i figured a mobile game should run very quickly not true there are still decently long loading screens when exploring the wasteland and making changes to the vault i would expect a game with such simplistic graphics programming and mechanics to run much faster even on old machine game specific comments in the short term you might enjoy this game but in the long term you will probably experience frustrations with the menus hotbox clickable areas and loading times if you want to support bethesda put money into one of their games that has more than an hour of play in it hope you enjoyed my review of fallout shelter if you liked it please up vote
this game used to be great until it got released now it has taken away half the stuff i worked hard for and was given to by the deus thought random loot boxes i spent sixty hours to get that my friend who has played over two hundred hours has had the same thing and its more like why give people stuff just to take it await will be fine for new members but old ones got ripped off
anyone know how the hell to fix the checking for new updater bug at the launch of the game it goes through many tries try one two three it center but in the end it doesn't launch instead it just comes up with a message that it failed to connect with update server help
really cool game if you liked the moves to show it features several species both from the movies and show my only gripes are that several species specific diet and abilities a rent in the game and that you have a species specific quest like the monstrous nightmares ability to light itself on fire the ladders spine shot and the typ boomerangs eel diet the species specific quest involves hovering and the only dragon that can hover is a wrinkle so in order to complete that quest you need a wrinkle this penalizes players who done pay for gems and didst choose a wrinkle as their starter dragon this could upset players that done have the money to spend on a virtual game but want to complete all current quests also you get a free whispering death in a later quest so done spend your money on getting an egg
product received for free early access review so in a doctor in behavioural medicine and on my questionnaires that i give to people who play this game to determine their sanity i ask them do you like loot crates and would you recommend this game if people answer yes they re maniacs and will need straitjackets on them immediately they pose a threat to society we will throw these people into soundproof cells and they will have multiple armed guards and scientists watching them but in all seriousness as a guy that spent more than one hundred on this game with loot crates please done you'll never be able to get the items you want unless you re really lucky and get them somehow
early access review early impressions are wonderful custom games are even more enjoyable than the matchmaking ranked seems to be really tactical in two versus twos only thing i hope to see in the future are larger maps each legend feels fairly balanced and can be counter with a few changed tactics i highly suggest gathering friends up for nonsense hope to see brawl all get its own queue at some point a brawl all would be pretty amazing worth a download if you enjoy smash bros or castle crashers
this game is a blocky three dimensional venturing game a bit like min craft but with a bit less to do done get me wrong there is still a lot to do tho its a simple game which is nice for casual players edit queues are mostly gone you can get in very easily now
so live unintentionally played this for five hours today yes its like min craft but its better in just about every way imaginable the crafting system is better the tool system is better the movement system is better the sounds are way better the only thing i find that is not better is the constant reminders to upgrade to pro that pretty annoying its a big advertisement i expect i eventually will get pro because unlike min craft i expect this game will go on sale at some point also twenty is a pretty decent price id like to hear some more reviews on the pro aspect before spending the money though for now its a very fun free play min craft
its trash and pay to win great combo played this back twenty fourteen or so when it was in early access and it was pretty good now its just a bunch of kiddies going pew pew and whoever pays the most wins the most this games path went down the same road like heroes generals was great when it first came out but its pay to win and so is this if you want to try it out go ahead but done get sucked in because while building ships is fun whoever has the best cannons and the most of that best cannon is the one to win that firefight just another free to play dumped down trash game for mindless five year old
used to be my fax game of all time but with the new without match update i feel i cant play this game anymore now i know why team fortress two you tubers started uploading over watch videos more often than team fortress two videos this game used to be one of the best games on steam now everyone is quitting it also i miss a paladin used to watch or guides now he quilted to no thumbs up for a valve until a fixed casual bring backups and quick play those good good of days are gone

this game is quite fun but there are loading issues i have had to close the game several times due to this loading issue the quest missions and character menu lags and breaks sometimes but despite these glitches and lag issues i look at what the game offers it sorta is a cash grab but there are fun thing in this game fireball frenzy is fun and the dragon races are fun as well flight club int really that hard be careful with what you spend your coins on always have at least ten bait just in case you run out of fish and coins the lab is cool as well you do learn about materials and what combines with what and what happens to certain materials on certain things as of seventy one thousand two hundred and sixteen the game is constantly crashing for several score the game would benefit from better graphics and for it to be a game and not a course in the science still enjoyable though i have no loading screen issues but the game probably has bad coding or should i say one hundred chance of bad coding best pc
early access review having played mtg for lots of years hearthstone and recently dabbling into gwent i can defiantly recommend this game to any collectible card game tag player the economy in the game is very very generous compared to headstone co and its possible to build a competitive deck within a week of playing without investing a single cent in the game you basically get a free pack every day for your first win and earn gold and cards from chest for every following win there is even the chance that the chests you get upgrade and earn you even more gold cards or packs the game play is very reminiscent of mtg which is no wonder considering that a lot of mtg greats like lev or patrick chain work on this game there are several game modes where you can play either against other players or the artificial intelligence you can can play simple one on one draft forge sealed against the artificial intelligence and there are events that are only open for a limited time and have specific rules for either game play or dec building its even possible to grind for gold against the artificial intelligence which makes it even easier to build a solid collection the game is decently balanced and there is a lot of variation on the ladder going on last but not least reaching the master rank in eternal is by far not as big as a grind as reaching legend in hearthstone or grandmaster in gwent and int just spamming a lot of games if you re sick of the ring and grind in hearthstone the prices in mtg or the current state of gwent i can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves and plays collectible card game tags
early access review this game sucks now the deus removed the megabits they added epic loot which is basically a loot this was the best free to play game i my opinion and now its ruined
i will be straight with you chief this game is a monopoly rip off nonetheless this game is incredibly fun and entertaining to play with your friends be wary tho this game will ruin friendships nonetheless we boo lin boy cd worth every penny bless up
early access review before starting this review lets keep in mind it is early access and label some of the bugs i have encountered bug one while going down certain slopes at high speeds while on the snowboard you can freeze and start lagging in place bug two while trying to perform a weapon swap and then immediately doing another action your weapon wont actually switch bug three vehicles moving at high speeds will glitch and teleport on your side of view compared to the smooth movement of the player actually driving now onto the good side of the game the game is fairly simple to grasp and understand the game itself offers a casual and competitive hairstyle to approach you are able to physically choose your spawn location than wasting about two minutes sky diving and praying you pick up a weapon first and now the bad side since the circle gives your a freeze effect on your screen and tints the ring a blue hue it can be fairly difficult to cope with players camping the outside of the storm since bullet drop doesn't seem to exist just from what live seen it might be a slight bullet drop trying to avoid gunfire while in the open really doesn't work at all directional sounds in the game are alright for now but done expect a refined and top of the line sound functional in all if you want a fun and casual battle royal that int super competitive pub or inconsistent ring based footnote this game is definitely a good choice
ign approved after i play this game i thought my life was not complete i was scrolling through the free games and i seen the word samurai screamed with pleasure and installed it i seen the game did not work for a month but i am determined to play this game for i feel like it is the key to my future it started to work so i get my lube and clicked furiously while mapping off my the skin flew everywhere as blood covered the hole of my hand unfortunately at that moment my dad walked in and said to me you re a disappointment so i jerk off more blood flew onto my computer and blew the socket so i went onto my dads computer installed the game and kept mapping to my hearts content now in twenty years old still mapping to laura clicker my sore from the moan of anime characters being slain by my serious boobs later on i sent this game to osaka bin ladin the date was and well we all know how that ended
one of the best free to play games ever but its developers are absolute scum they re rude greedy and just done really give a damn about their community getting new vehicles takes way by too long the core game play hast been changed in years and for some reason world war two era tanks will be up up against tanks built twenty years later for a game that claims realism it sure is historically inn curate i mean in no history expert but in pretty sure bombers didst fly off on their own without formation despite the community pleas for change in game play the developers simply continue adding more vehicles to the game and charging you sixty for them go play another game and done waste your time
this game is great it includes a full game with a retro feel witch is great for anyone who played with the old consoles this game is comparable to old titles with a up to date graphics and sound this game is just an all around great game to have and to play in your spare time
early access review have played this game for seven hundred and one hours and two years now live tried this game competitively i have reached the highest ranks as far as my region goes live spent close to fifty dollars on this game here is what i think of this game brawl all is one of those games that you will tremendously enjoy its got several different game modes competitive casual and private options for multiplayer its got a training room which has expansive options for learning how to play the game this game has one of the best developers working behind it they even have their own sports department and tournaments are featured on the main menu frequently loads of options that you can have when playing this game free to play you will have fun playing this game if you re looking to play casually spend maybe sixty great intense hours with your friends download this game if this applies to you however to the forty of the population who wants to try this game to reach the top read on playing ranked is whole different game although it has a great sports scene this game is severely broken and terrible at the high levels the main problem is this there is no punishment for running away what makes a fighting game a fighting game is that two opponents are essentially forced to battle out in an arena with intense action and adrenaline everywhere however in brawl all at the highest ranks you re essentially trying to bait each other out and parry defensive play is the only option if you want to win the game let me put it this way a good story has a beginning conflict rising action climax and a resolution in brawl all although there is conflict its often either you chasing someone you losing to someone who waits for you to attack first or you doing the above there is no rising action so when a match finally ends is more like a flop this game will feel terrible and there nothing you can do about it some weapons are incredibly overpowered as well the developers do not make a good attempt at trying to make all styles of plays and weapons viable like the disaster game which is league of legends there always a pool of weapons and legends that are considered top tier before they are pulled off where as some weapons make reading very hard ten different options to escape and punish back some weapons feel like five thousand and fifty or you lose the entire game in essence brawl all is a fun an excellent game that should be played with many of your friends its almost guaranteed you will have a great time however this game lacks extremely at the higher level just look at a clip from a tournament that happened yesterday a pro player has earned money from this game actually tweeter mid game because his opponent resolved to a style where he was just waiting for punishes tips clips twitch trust me this is how sixty of all matches turn out old its an excellent game for playing casually done invest time into it if you re going to play ranked
that skill tree is huge but the actual amount of choices is limited some call this game path of life nodes because if you done pick a ton of life nodes chances are you'll be a weak leaf unable to resist the slightest breeze by the time you get to the third difficulty that said the games done a number of forced skill tree resets over the last year and its a pain to have to restart such a huge build every time then again its nice to be given the freedom to do so because like many others i completely messed up my build by not holding to the life node rule glass cannon comes to mind all in all its a great game many times better than diabolo three and free to boot and best of all unlike most free to play games the deus of this game have a strict no pay to win ever rule anything you can buy in this game is decorative extra inventory slots cool special effects and pets totally worth it because the game is fair to all players
early access review beta tested this game and in its current state i wouldn't recommend it the grind takes too long and the game has moved away from having fun robots i played when it was only team death match there was no flipping method and only helium live had fun since those days but the fact that they took away user points and added so much grind is intolerable i grinder tier ten to have a megabit which done exist anymore if they done change the money grubbing version of this game i recommend not downloading this game i will update this post if things change free am in looking at you
couldn't play on personal computer windows ten whenever i hold acceleration button turning left right doesn't work have to release acceleration in order to turn is it supposed to work like that
i have almost one thousands hours in this game and i am addicted to it yes but i am still playing in hopes that hire can seriously get its together new gods are always over powered even after being on the public test servers and some old gods still need to be worked on and are over powered everything is now about gems which you have to pay real money for and this game is getting greedy as with issues of longer que times gods being under or overpowered and a decent bit of toxic players i wouldn't recommend this game unless you buy nothing and play the free rotation gods unless hire does some serious fixes to their game and not try and produce a in battle royal spin off of and i almost forgot their servers are having some malfunctions where people do from games at the start and have to reconnect which takes a couple minutes which in a mob the first couple minutes of a game is huge and then if people finish a game sometimes you get stuck on an endless victory or defeat screen that you have to restart the game to fix and then on your friends list if you and your friend get out of separate games at the same time you cant invite them because it says they are still in game so that means that one of you has to restart the game in order to fix this issue that my two cents peace
best game a first off running max setting sitting in a bush with a sniper rifle but cant see a damn thing then getting cross map snipe by a pistol is nice also good luck starting fresh imagine the fun you will have getting spawn camped like a boss with like two tanks dominating your team cut most of your team have rifles of some sorts but done have at stuff good game thanks love not winning games over and over and over cut i done anything other then my swinging to fight a tank with
early access review have played hours days weeks and it was to much fun to stop it was so addictive but since updates came some of the updates we pretty cool but with this update it broke my heart they have ruined everything i do not recommend playing it now its not fun anymore and i done see a point in playing it anymore first i rate freaking one thousand one hundred and ten now i rate two hundred and thirty four thousand two hundred and ten a i a my good old friend rob craft
live been playing the game for several years now as a tester the game play is up to the standard of any competitive multiplayer you can name its matured to the point the balance changes are made with the aim of keeping things fresh instead of putting out fires there are very few other games that can give you the same feeling that dreadnought provides and none that live played recently the visual aesthetics are fantastic and with the steam release the game now has audio to match that gravitas i am a fan of the fluidity of the new user interface introduced for the steam release as well it needs some refinement but over all it is much slicker and more modern than the previous iteration i recommend this game to all fans of the vehicle shooter genre it is familiar enough that anyone who has played mech warrior online star conflict fractured space crosscut rob lox it center will be able to get into the hot seat right away and at the same time it is a different beast altogether i guarantee you'll enjoy the feeling of unstoppable power that comes with piloting a ship the size of a city block some resizing to follow personal computer user interface conventions higher res module icons better menu mapping to reduce number of clicks needed and get rid of that ugly edit ship button
early access review the game has some problems but as the saying goes a cant judge a book by its cover a should give it a try and then decide what a think me and my friend bought the game and we a currently enjoying it i my my self bought three copy and i done regret it i hope they keep updating and improving the game i cant wait to see what becomes of it
the learning curve can be tough at times but i find myself in a strange addiction of always coming back to playing this game even if its only so i can get just a little bit better at it
hello possible future trivia do you remember playing any sandbox games in the past when i thought of sandbox games done right i always felt like terra ria was the game i enjoyed the most and spent hours upon hours designing my home in my world or just my world in general so to me the nostalgia and excitement around the game always struck me now picture this terra ria in a voted based universe granted trove is rather new the blogs and updates from the creators make the game even more promising i look forward to be able to do world bosses or the such in the future this game allows you the freedom to switch your combat classes about as well as the exploration of the world in this game there are guild like groups called clubs some of these clubs will really blow your mind with music playing on actual tracks live been really enjoying this game so far and although the market economy is really ambiguous its mostly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone considering it
if you love yugo and wanted to duel with your friends you re going to hate this game its a stupid cash grab filled with way too many popups doesn't even follow the game rules nor do cards do what they re suppose to this is an insult to a great game and i wouldn't even play it for free that how bad this game was it took at least ten years to get through the intro course even after asking your level of familiarity with the game the deck creation is extremely limited and the navigation of the games menus is also broken and dumb not to mention the game early fits your resolution and is in the dumbest aspect ratio this game is trash trash yuri would be spinning his grave
this review will be edited over the course of els word update this game is so awesome pros ten different characters to choose from with three different job paths for each one giving them a variety of different skills and play styles the levelling up for starters is user fast and once you get past level three thousand and forty the levelling gets more challenging there an els word website which keeps you updated on every single tiny thing added or announced so that awesome a player versus player player is player mode which pairs you up with a random player to battle a dungeon mode you can play with friends or randomly matched people to complete in game story quests the characters voices were originally in korean but now log is slowly revamping each character with some fresh new english voice lines and they sound awesome cons the player versus player system is kind of unfair you always get paired up with some els word veteran who ends up demolishing you with an endless combo but i done really see any way to fix that this game is kind of pay to win having you spend money on the in game currency ching to get the good costumes and stuff side from that the game is great i totally recommend this xanthus approved
i love the scale of this game the maps are bigger than anything i have ever seen before in a game sometimes in open areas you'll get pinned down behind a rock while fifty tanks battle it out around you my only complaint is it takes forever to get cert points this game kinda has a pay to win aspect over all though this game pretty epic eight thousand five hundred and ten
a wonderfully crafted cartoony arena shooter there are nine classes to choose from one the scout a boston born rude in surface and speedy character that has a double jump ability the soldier a crazed patriot from americas heartland hes versatile and a great starter class to get familiar with of the pro a mumbling pyromaniac of indeterminate origin who has a burning passion for all things fire related the demo an a scrumpy swilling explosives expert from the scottish highlands the heavy hailing from the user he is the largest and possibly most dangerous class in of the engineer specializes in constructing and maintaining buildings that provide support the medic provides healing for the members of his team and has a special ability known as an be charge the sniper from the aussie outback this character provides long range support with his trusted sniper rifle the spy this character can be rendered invisible and can disguise as members of the other team there are also a plethora of maps and weapons that can also be used to your advantage to gain control and defeat the other team team fortress two is definitely one of the best free play games to ever be
i was playing as my archer twenty eight and i joined a cemetery dungeon with a knight with full to tops and an exam he ring he had one star and my archer took less damage from the skills than he did he was level fourteen and died on the third boss rip thirty

early access review this game is filled with nothing but lobbies of cheaters most people in game just complain about being put in a lobby with a cheater rather then vote to kick them and when a vote is started everyone votes not to kick the cheater even though they re single handed a making the game worse for everyone even worse from my perspective it looks like the deus done even bother to bar them from playing they just give them a sub name cheater do yourself a favor and stay far from this game pro every map seems to be a re texture of old counterstrike maps pretty cool even if its bad large and easily accessible gun library to mess with simple and easy controls cheaters in every lobby you get shot in the head a lot through the map angles control too much overpriced crap weapons overpriced overpowered weapons no one votes to kick the cheater your team will never wish der bugs in everyman make the fight onside like above con each map is sided towards the warriors to win high ground and right turns with long tunnels to put a gunner down as you can tell i did not spend much time on this game due to the downsides provided above
this game is tedious and frustrating but addicting in a bad way do not get this game it will suck one hundred of your like away faster than wow and is far less entertaining and i hate wow
astonishingly bad graphics and repetitive a challenging game play the pop ups and reward systems suggests it as being grind and shop centric the mechanics of play looked like and a as a computer game i much preferred never winter nights two and id rather return to that very dated game than endure any more of this
game would be pretty cool if not the matchmaking system the matchmaking is a joke you get like five six or sometimes even ten defeats in a row with score like one seven zero seven very often situations like six people from the team are tier seven and you are tier six very bad matchmaking is what we games are known from pretty well so no surprises here unless you use premium account the matchmaking seems to be better when you use premium account so maybe the my system is made on purpose in such a way to get you frustrated and start to think i need premium account in order to grind effectively
early access review worst game live played in recent years no balance only two weapons mean anything in the game and the most common tactic is just to camp absolute waste of disk space players a rent toxic for the most part at least
early access review not bad so far very clunky and slow there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships and the load out upgrades feel underwhelming not competing the servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well even on a machine that far surpass the tech specs for the game still strangely fun though think mob in space but not like you would a normal mob much of the skill elements involved in mob games are removed especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large slow clunky space ships the only near exception to this would be the blink ability flash from laugh out loud available to some ships recommended might as well try it and maybe it will get better
running for your life simulator two thousand and fifteen crank up the volume its no fun if you done get a good scare or three and just when you think you've made it past jumps to much more deadly scares nightmares crawling up your rear while the room is a red haze they re back those damn maze rooms that always where my friend and i get butchered and the damn controls at least you heal a little every second so you stand a fighting chance from floor to floor made it thirteen of the way through room three hundred and ten before eating it the last time pick it up for a free game that looks straight out of nineteen ninety twos its surprisingly creepy
not really worth playing installed created character and thirty seconds into game play shot dead threat the second survivor and get booted from the server first survivor now reliable and play long enough to type two messages into global when some one says every one is hostile and shot dead not worth playing a game with such a toxic game play on beginner servers no need to worry about zombies only nee to worry about players killing you when you have only been playing for the first thirty seconds repeatedly never got a chance to get weapons nor a chance to learn how to play the game will be uninstalling the game and not returning i will stick to actual zombie games
biggest rip off i ever encountered spend approximately fifty euros played twenty drafts rarely had a decent game either mana flooded constantly or not being able to play second colour while my so called human opponents play thirty four colours constantly and have surprisingly always the exact answer in hand that they need to turn the game around if i do manage to get on board yeah rite
this game used to be good then i checked it out and now its a massive grind est and you gain basically nothing from a match like mon some things cost like a and you gain two a per game soon please fix but the robot building is nice
this is such a fun little game they need to create more characters put a chat in and add some interactive game features to the middle of the board i feel like the dice are rigged too but overall this game is really fun
early access review the people that claim that this game will give you a virus or steal your data are either fort pub fanboys or people that installed hacks like in morons the game is absolutely incredible from my experience so far if someone has actual proof of a virus or stolen data please comment thanks
its a good game a better more he version of min craft also the deus slowly do it but they listen to what the players want and are less rude than other games deus in happy with the team and the game
early access review expected this game to get better over the years but all the deus are doing is trying to make it more profitable with micro transactions now i just feel that i wasted all that time by expecting it to get better this game is now far past its prime and it will keep going downhill the developers are trying to force people to spend money when all they need to do is make a good game
game the concept is good but the deus reduce players capabilities so if they done like you your bullets done have as much effect and in not making this up the owner of foreigner said so stupid game would not recommend
the best argive played endless hours of entertainment sixty less than competing brands they continue to update the game free of charge i would say poe is about a twenty game for end game you will want to buy some stash tabs for quality of life improvements other than that the only thing you can buy is cosmetics which is entirely up to you if you want to earn free cosmetics take part in the races or challenge leagues where you complete challenges for free cosmetics if you want diabolo four play this
am i playing a twenty tens massively multiplayer online jesus christ usually i done complain about graphics but having experience consecutive stutters first person shooter drops for this quality of graphics this game is hurting my damn eyes well then again its free soon
glad to have wasted one thousand hours on this game endlessly grinding for no reason the objective of this game is to go from dungeon to dungeon killing enemies to gain experience points and loot such as items weapons or gem boxes doing this results in boredom and makes me want to die there are several classes to choose from some being overpowered such as high dog shots or firing five hundred arrows a second and some being useless and never used its unbalanced but the developers done seem to care about their game but rather how much money they can make within their updates the updates usually happen around special events such as christmas or easter act and even if they do proper updates fixing stuff and remaking something they include a head start pack that includes things that are either hard impossible to get while grinding for them overall the game is a piece of done spend money on it
all these guys saying it is pits not have nine up special characters and over fifty green magic balls and i invested nothing in this game its all about skill and you can just mute everyone who is toxic at higher levels you'll find better people
spent more than three hundred hours when i got it from the bethesda store just done buy anything in game because the purchases apply per save file its better without buying anything trust me it is a very admirable game i really like the conversations that happen between the dwellers and when you go for quests and raids sometimes they are wacky sometimes they are cringe sometimes they are just downright smooth i highly recommend this game one thousand and ten
early access review overall a great game after several playing need to fix a little bit about accuracy and speed on shooting maybe after release we can get new skins new mount or new chicken overall its a great game
looks great in virtual reality on the vive until you start to look around at populated areas an it turns into a judder sickening mess and this is on a ghz a with a gtd one thousand and eighty with the default low virtual reality graphics settings unplayable on the vive
great game except when you get kicked and get a stupid message about game session active so a keep trying then your in gets blocked for an hour and you cant even submit a ticket guess i lose my backpack and my she on top of getting kicked for an hour bullshit bullshit bullshit
honestly going into this i didst think i would find this game to be as enjoyable as i did its just a really casual unmovable version of early min craft but with more emphasis on materials and with more of a vaguely sci i slant rather than min crafts vaguely fantasy one there a few quirks in the engine relating to being built in unity rather than java for instance units physics are a bit spotty and sometimes underground mobs will hilariously fly through the earth into the stratosphere as if called to rapture however from my end the game seems to run much smoother than min craft does and its much easier to set up a multiplayer server the biggest negative i have for it is that it really spends a lot of time advertising downloadable content to the point it really starts to get annoying but hey at its heart its essentially another min craft and who doesn't like min craft
early access review what can i say about this if you re a magic the gathering fan its pretty decent and the only real thing that i has in common with hearthstone is the style as with all card games luck can and will screw you over as well as bless you and make you feel epic to complain about ring in a card game is just silly i have not had much trouble at all with making decent decks on this game with gauntlet mode and forge making it easy to get a decent collection as well as the ability to frag all the extras and create what you want granted some cards are way over priced but think of it this way some people payed one hundred for a zap dos or one thousand for a black lotus in magic terms all in all decent card game with a mana system similar to magic but slower paced than hearthstone and its free to play so you can get a feel for the game before you decide to commit so give it a try
wow this game is complete dog completely luck based if you are someone with no skills in life a fifteen spa retardation are fifty six and weigh eight five pounds like robbie then you should play this game if you have a future in life done play this game if you are over the height of fifty six done play this game if you like in the play this game if you smell like cheeks play this game if nobody like you and you have no friends play this game if any of this applies to you follow these instruction trust me this game is really bad
very detailed sim and a joy to fly using a flight stick a big drawback is the inability to skip the guy talking or to restart the tutorial so every time you fail you have to sit through ten minutes of talking again
never understood the buzz of these games everything is behind a wall of time or money and there is no game play i can appreciate the art and lore but other then that its a cell phone game done even get me started on that subject
a great game to play in the background while you re doing an assignment or playing another game or waiting for premiere pro to render its a good time waster just done expect much to happen
early access review would one hundred recommend this game i haven been able to find any faults with it so far and live played for a pretty good amount of time compared to pub for it and other battle royal games it definitely feels nicer to play as in it feels consistent and controls movement and overall game functionality is just nice to use i done think i can fault the game as of yet nor do i think ill be able too at this rate for an early access its honestly one of the best games live ever played id even to to the length of saying its the best live played this year good job
this is a game i have no doubt in my mind that this is a game this game exists i can not say that this game does not exist because well of course it does i mean come on its a video game and it was made a video game was made at some point and they decided this would be that game now who is they well of course its the people who made this game but why did they make this game i mean why because a game was at one point bound to be made that right thus this game was made this game has it all a name game play music and i heard and saw all of that while playing this game now my opinion on those things is that they were put in the game and thus they are a part of a game and thus they are the game and thus they are indeed a game would i recommend this game i mean a game is a game after all and thus i must say that this game is a game which is why this game is most definitely a game for me thank you for this game
overall or is a great system it works has no bugs its smooth when you are playing performs great the way you buy content is nice if you are a online racer like racing but much cheaper but with all that content especially the it cars they really should add hours cycle and weather would make a huge difference in this game and if you do that well people with virtual reality would love it that pretty much the reason i done continue with this sim and if anyone reading this wanna buy content go to their site and buy arp its cheaper that way as you wont pay the steam fees i guess so overall if you are a beginner to the sim racing world i recommend buying it if you done want to depend on mods and done mind the static environment buy it too
this game is literary up if you done pay you wont enjoy ten first minutes are okay then its garbage i wanted to check the higher out well too bad gotta pay for it okay then i uninstall its a one hundred and ten for me be sex best in pay to play site pages pas to approaches pas les ten premieres minutes sort just of puts best de la meet be valais regarded be higher pistole allemande ben nan fast payer pas de problem be do install best in one hundred and ten pour moi
early access review full see a lot of opinions of this game the fanboys who will support whatever the developers do and explain to you that that free am is doing everyone a service by allowing this game to be free you have the new players who probably think this could be a great game if they worked on a few things things that have existed in the past and have since been done away with you then have the old players the ones who put a lot of effort to get that last bit of role play to get the next piece of hardware to hopefully lift you to the next tier those players have seen this game turn into a phone app that says free next to it and then right underneath in game purchases optional but we all know that you need to purchase those if you done want to be miserable for a while in one of those players and this is my first steam review of a game because i think whats happened to this game is unfortunate its a shame that all the feedback all the bug reports we have compiled have led to this latest update
product received for free early access review its just completely pay to win so get to the main game aka tank is jet sorry propeller aircraft is infantry combat you have to be level five now the problem is its so hard to get to level up and ironically there is a membership program to level faster its a good game but its so pay to win
early access review this game is very fun and exciting the first time i played i love sandbox survival games but i think it would be better if it had way more customizations for your character and house decor also more mobs it got boring really quick
early access review in my opinion the gunplay is horrible in this game doesn't feel smooth at all what other have said already about this games client running in the background is true after running this game and playing my personal computer would freeze get blue screen it center this was caused by the foreigner client that kept running in the background even after the game was closed even after opening up task manager and killing it uninstalled the game and freezes and blue screens were gone
i have read in a couple places and they keep talking about adding motion control support for vive when exactly will this happen i know people think that it would not work but have you played time machine the motion controllers work fine with it the left controller is your flight stick in sure it can be programmed easily for digital combat simulator the right stick can be many things has anyone tried universe sandbox with a key press on left stick where the grip is you can open up a display on top of the left stick without giving up control of the flight and select menus or selections using your right controller the right controller can also be used to virtually touch the switches and turn knobs all by holding down the trigger and using the motion of turning or pushing it can also be your throttle hold down trigger move forward for thrust or backwards for cutting engines if i could code i would be all over this in a heart beat thanks for listening and please let me know if this is possible
early access review help if int this game another one of gains money carving shovels winning in this game absolutely gets you nothing and really doesn't matter if you end up one or ten at the end of the day both of those poor bastards get zilch this game int anything to be taken seriously just play it in your free time and only and only for fun comics grinding in this game is just pure pay and bow if they tried to charge you for the simple free game play later on just plus stop playing and delete this let foreigner gets drowned in its own ocean of greed done let them sink youth and bow hackers are bombing the out of this game do something about it you useless pieces of and remove that in pan for lord stalin satan sake and jesus assess in christ done let even begin about the in hit boxes in this game
two is one of the deepest most satisfying and equally frustrating gaming experiences in this era i still love the game and its such an excitement to watch as an sport however it really should come with a warning playing or rather learning to play data is a part time job the time investment in this game is huge you will get cussed out have terrible back back matches and a new patch will come along and make your favourite heroes a pain to play that said if you have the time you be hard pressed to find a more satisfying feeling than getting that perfect initiation or landing a man ultimate and the comebacks it is possible to comeback when your team is getting their handed to them so done give up old must play if you have the time and patience
if you like building games at all creatives is definitely worth a try it is a bit slow going at first but you done have to memorize any crafting recipes they re unlocked as you craft things and remembered for you you can even favourite and track recipes which helps if you re wanting to make a lot of a few things there no reason not to give it a shot since its free to play
a decent half court basketball game that actually has nice graphics skills and cosmetics the only problem is that there are pay to win elements within the game that gives some people an edge on the bright side this game was a lot more popular than freestyle football so it probably wont close down soon
early access reviewing been playing counter strike for almost twenty years its my number one game in those twenty years i always looked for other fun games to play in between counter strike games i played he deathwatch day of defeat all cods until my mon unreal tournament quake i enjoyed all of them more recently i tried and played several other games looking for something new destiny two hated it footnote absolutely terrible the latest cod world war two enjoyed the single player but multiplayer want my thing i got all hyped for battalion nineteen forty ours but until now it disappointed me i will give it another chance though as they are still working on the game the one game i tried and kept playing was pub although the game was not optimized well had all of its flaws it was fun to play for a few rounds what i done understand is that people can play it for hours on end it gets so in boring the recent update with the smaller map and more loot was a change i liked but overall for me the game is broken i in hate the game it got great potential but the developers are just milking the cow now in my opinion hence i deleted the game and searched for something new enter cuisine royal free early access i in love this game so early in development it looks better feels better and is optimized better then pub spray patterns and hit boxes are already really good but can still be improved i like the random spawn points loot is balanced pretty good sometimes you can be unlucky with loot but if you play it right you will always find something to get a kill and steal there loot i personally like the funny gadgets and perks but even without them the game would be a lot of fun it could be interesting in the future the have several game modes one like it is now and one that is more realistic a mode without the bunny slippers actual backpacks instead of shopping bags realistic arm or and helmets would probably attract a lot more players to the game what should be improved at this time is to have the lobby actually in the game cause right now you need to enter a game to be able to change your settings key binds are also not working for me i cant seem to change them also missing an option to bind every weapon on one key primary secondary all i see is previous weapon which i done like in game the developers should just keep doing what there doing i think there doing a great job they keep bringing updates that fixes bugs and bring improvements to the game as the game is free there is no reason not to try it would i pay for this game absolutely yes
early access review great game great graphics fun player versus player no overpowered crap that i can see one on one is normally an bodies game instead of one ship just pulverizing only downfall of this game is the in matchmaking is broken half the time as in you cant connect to a match to save your life other then that great stuff excited to see where it goes hopefully not pay to win
really fun game with a min craft sorta feel to in way better and more independent compared to min craft ripoffs great for all ages if your into a creative building games pros large selection of building resources free free free worlds seem to be completely random multiplayer support with the ability to have passwords for privacy cons requires account out of steam pay to access blueprints and other features useful can be repetitive and stuck what i mean by stuck is once you have completed all the recipes for items and have maxed there int anywhere to go besides build now that i think about it that pretty much every game
i done know how in supposed to start this review back in the days rob craft was my go to game and one of my favourite games rob craft has been such a great game i really loved playing i done exactly know why the developers decided to change up the whole game principle with tiers one two and so on in my last days back then the boss battle i guess was introduced and i enjoyed playing it as well and then the developers crashed the game with introducing levels instead of tiers and changing the game mode from just stacking the whole team onto the other side and capturing the enemy base to this weird thing with these plutonium reactor from wikipedia laugh out loud when i started the game today after a long time i was greeted with my old account and twenty five cases i had to open mind off the game went a long way from free to play to pay in with cases and a dons for ten thousand eight hundred and ninety six i searched for a match and had to wait for about a minute because i left the last match a year or two ago a yeah so what am i supposed to say in conclusion back in the days i absolutely loved the game but in the current state i done like it and i wouldn't invest my time into this game anymore outside steam
i really did enjoy this game for a long time and its a really good idea of a game but the game is becoming somewhat of a pay to win when you remove the ability to get a new class in a game that enjoyable because of its variety of classes and only make them obtainable through in game purchases ruins the experience of the game
early access review compared to other battle royals like footnote or pub realm royal is one hundred my favourite they re is so many different mechanics in the game that makes it different the forge system arm or mounts chicken revives classes and it center
smite is really a mixed bag for me i stopped playing league a couple of years ago for a lot of the same reasons that other people did the fun in the game had long been sucked dry by people who throw missy fits if they done get the most kills or if they re paired with people who are still trying to learn the game i was never that great at the game and found that i really want able to improve when no one wanted to play with a noon and with that i left when i heard about smite in early twenty fifteen from jon tron i was eager to give mobs a second chance i loved playing the game and found myself a welcome member of the community as much as i loved the game i stopped playing for awhile only picking up the game back up on steam in the summer of after getting used to the game again i started playing player versus player again holy how things had changed it really felt like i was playing league again with all of the in at least once a day out of all the games i play ill see newer players bullied out of games in my opinion its a community responsibility to encourage its members to improve instead of just calling them boobs and all over them smite is an amazing game but i think anyone who int contributing to the toxicity can agree that the community has isolated itself from new players and finding the enjoyment that the game once offered is becoming increasingly difficult also holy someone fix susan please
early access review bought this game within a week or so after it came out on steam bought the harbinger pack when it did come out and recently upgraded to the vanguard pack because of how well it plays now as it stands right now i wish there was a maybe on the recommended button section i cannot vote for nor vote against the game it is not quite polished enough for my liking but its still a great game which makes me torn over whether or not to recommend to friends pros good graphics at max settings a getting six thousand and ninety first person shooter with my current setup a balance between classes needs a bit more tweaking good overall selection of ships and skin love the experience and credits mechanics which were nonexistent when i quit before cons missing skins what happened to the ghost type skin its missing from my inventory and know i had it before i lost interest in the game edit seems i was mistaken i did not realize that there were two versions of the ghost one being the premium ship i got from vanguard and the one that you have to gain experience to get which i believe would have the skin i thought was missing all i seem to ever get are eur servers thought by now they would have implemented us servers or ones that are close to the us for the sake of lag reduction for us based players honestly this is one of the reasons i quit the last time no way this is on my end seeing as i have a custom gaming rig and over sixty meg line plus i have seen a lot of complaints from other people about this in chat since i started to play again really fix this soon or you may loose more people again price point price is perfect if and only if the server issue gets fixed either faster server net speed or add us servers from what i can tell no way to make a platoon of more than two in a group i could be wrong since i haven invited anyone to the game practice test area is dumb artificial intelligence to test a ship would be nice which i would have thought would have been placed in this game and the way the key layout is would be nice to have this to test a rebind of keys on a ship random matchmaking throws me off a bit i remember ability to create servers and and remember the servers identifying as eur or us based off the host not really a con development killed me enough said laugh out loud honestly this is a cool thing deus actually playing the game that they design which to me surprised me and made me smile one thousand and ten would die against a development again may
early access review for some reason i find min craft boring despite my kids loving it somehow this game has spoken to me and its turned out to be great family fun at our house we purchased two copies for the kids and one for myself and the wife it may not be the most amazing game ever but its a lot of fun being able to build things and explore in a simple but yet complex dynamic environment the graphics are good in the sense that its a step up from min craft though performance seems to be a bit saggy at times for unknown reasons not bad enough to completely impact game play overall if you re tired of the same old min craft give creatives a try maY
first the community here suck done search for teammates second same thing because of hackers third full of bug in server lobby and when you are finally connected you could lose hours of game play just because the server int implemented and kick you because of timeout delay the deus did they developed a game at least are just here to steal money from some fanatics members finding worth to be at the top scoreboard and done give a damn a for other players in a nutshell give you the opportunity to waste your time on better lands than those ones indeed
early access review it was an okay game but this update is garbage the update took away all that made this game slightly interesting in a battle royal and a a a a a on it uninstalling if i wanted a fortnight ripoff i would just go play it
early access review for someone who dislikes the toxicity of multiplayer games eternal is to some degree a breath of fresh air the single player content is awesome i love digital card games that embrace the single player experience the game itself has the complexity of mtg but the accessibility of hearthstone i done get why this game int more well received
early access review this game was a promising game and a good time up until the the last two patch have just killed it done bother down loading there are better alternatives out there good luck have fun
early access review best game in the world what can i say for it is garbage town pub is two first person shooter town this mix good graphics with cars epic guns and in pans this has to bethe best god damn game i have ever played like no joke i got eighty hours on this beast and now they got cooking seasons what is next runs great plays great feels great keep up all the amazing working
early access review the game is very fun at first but gets boring very quickly you basically have to beat the campaign to actually get started with new cards the campaign is fast and kind of easy and after you beat it there nothing specific to really do the quests are alright but not that interesting for the most part
keeps on giving me an error while downloading the files in game two hours trying to download the game files read the real reviews about the game not the funny reviews done waste your time or money on this game
great game great graphics and good for novice to experts if you want to use the etc vive you may want to disconnect your vive from the personal computer before launching this game for the first time to allow you to go into the virtual reality settings and select mouse as an option otherwise you may not have a way of navigating the menus and get stuck at the main menu once i eventually figured out i had to do that i was then able to set up my hot as and get flying caution may cause motion sickness around barrel roll number four enjoy May
team fortress two used to be my favourite game i clocked thousands of hours on it i bought hats crafted and dragged with the matchmaking update it often takes five hundred and thirty minutes to play a map of your choice despite an ample amount of compatible players searching for it i wrote this entire review while waiting for a game to start with thirty our compatible players in my country which according to the map selection screen was green meaning many players were available to play with matches you against teams with less players than yours making it no challenge at all or impossible if you re on the other side of that equation this is because they removed auto balance which want the best system but at least worked well enough makes it very difficult to play with and or invite friends to your game in order to invite and play with a friend neither of you can actively be in a game invites done pop up like messages do so you can easily miss such an invite because it wont show up in a game if you re in a game and invited to another game tough luck for you no more hopping into your friends game partway through even if there are four more players on red than blue it also makes it impossible to play against a friend on opposite teams no more grudge matches with your peers the update destroyed the world of community servers that made team fortress two so casual and fun were six months into this update and subsequent updates and its still broken they could have left team fortress two as it was for years it was an awesome game for years and years new games with better graphics and features came out but team fortress two survived with a healthy community of players valve ignored a huge user outcry against the update and unfortunately team fortress two will be one of those games we used to play and used to be so much fun we could have just gotten some more useless crates hats or weapons but instead they broke it they could have left it exactly as it was and people would have kept buying two crate keys spending thousands of dollars on hats and donating to community servers but instead they tried to make it better to compete with over watch its awful now i only login occasionally at the insistence of my steam friends what a shame rip team fortress two two thousand and sixteen
by far my favourite collectible card game and live played a lot of them yes the transition to the new client was rough but spark pants have quickly sorted almost all of the bugs and it feels a lot faster than the old client now looking forward to new features and the new expansion
early access review realm royal is by far my favourite game of two thousand and eighteen its quite literally the only game i truly enjoy playing for hours after all the horrendous game and community destroying patches realm went through because of hires foolish ideas in glad to say realm is back at its peak in fact i think it is even better then it was back in its prime when it was released in june two thousand and eighteen this game is loads of fun takes skill and strategy and is awesome to play with friends i highly recommend this game to anyone especially if you are a fan of the battle royal genre one thousand and ten love this game so much June
early access review do not play unless you wish to be disappointed id say come back in two to three years then maybe you can play it normally right now in its forever beta stage do not play do not bother spending money overall waste of time as of now that is
what a load of rubbish lost all my stuff after being disconnected from a server actually one of the worst games i have played done waste your time many more zombie games out there better then this load of bull
started playing twenty thirteen and its still entertaining me best support with a reply within one hour free expansions every three months and a big community on twitch and geddit even tho the plebs on geddit are real
early access review loved the game before twenty fifteen when it was only here for you to enjoy but now it has the money grading system and id write a whole story about how bad this game is now but i have to go poop bye
early access review only good thing is that the game is free but will try to take your money anyway this game has changed since i have first played it and i will probably never play it again
this game is super fun not the same deus as the original infestation even says this in the description learn to read advertised as a player versus player massively multiplayer online that is why there are guns everywhere the re spawn timer is there for a reason not pay town because of private servers you just need to not suck it is super easy to loot on fifty pop server the cool down for me kits is not four seconds it is for other beds but not me kits done be dumb the beginner servers are there for a reason the third person view is not an advantage when everyone has it i can log into servers within ten seconds just get a better computer yes this games crashes but it is part of the charm this game is super fun if you have some friends to play with while it makes you super mad sometimes you will always come back it just takes a lot of skill to actually play this game if you are dumb at all you will suck and die a lot then you will go make a review on how this game sucks because you kept dying i played the original infestation when it was still called war and i loved it then too it has always been fun and all the little not game breaking bugs just add much to the enjoyment of this game and honestly the graphics may not be the best but if you play colorado a and wait until night time you will see how beautiful this game can get May
great game to play with friends and work together with real world strategies to outsmart your opponents whether you like to blast away in arcade mode or go full immersion in simulator mode war thunder does its best to suite all players
great strategy game for fallout fans i have been hearing a lot of negative reviews for this game but i think its great plus i done have a smart phone so this compensates the game for me eight hundred and ten
like many of the remaining players who stay true to this game despite developers shout out to artemis knives sergeant props to russian caliper for carrying the team on your back constant cheaters dos attacks duping glitching bugs terrible swimming animations and people yelling brazil brazil in chat while throwing down zombie barricade riot shields down one after another it center the list can literally go on for the entirety of this review we continue to play this toxicity infested community crash prone survival video game i think the best way to sum up this game is that it was built on an engine that just feels right for the player versus player intense atmosphere that we know as crash i mean war i mean infestation survivor stories or whatever emulator we happen to be playing at the time one thing that should be known is that one of the lead developers if not the main lead developer wrote cheats notice how i didst say hacks cheats are a method of cheating or exploiting game using scripts or taking advantage of information received but not displayed to the client from what i understand he continues to write cheats in order to ruin other emulators and bring a larger player base to his version i think this is sort of scummy to do but i also think its smart i respect intellect and you definitely earned my respective been playing this emulator since it got an official steam release live racked up two hundred and fifty hours so far and i can gladly say i enjoy this game but i will say if you've never played a version of this engine you will most likely hate every moment of it unless you have friends who can teach you the ropes you re in for a rough time for a free video game live spent about twenty dollars on micro transactions so i could have a different player model and a few skins that i thought looked nice did it give me an advantage over any other players no if you re truly looking for a free player versus player game where the essential idea is to take gear from other players i and put it in yours as long as the current developers continue to improve the game reduce cheaters and the player base remains i will continue to play new
good free to play massively multiplayer online with a more active combat system then most very fun there are definitely some pay to win aspects but if you learn where to find gear you can sell you can make a fair bit of money quickly and you can freely trade in game currency for peoples zen built right in so with some effort you can get what you want it seems rough at first but you just need to figure out whats worthwhile to sell
i started playing this game on the first week of public open beta and have loved it ever since its like world of tanks in space if you like games like world of tanks or world of warships you'll probably love this game
i never played the mobile version of the game but since i saw that this game came to steam and it was free i decided to try it out its really cool and fun and all for yugo fans but now i want bleach brave souls and do kan battle on steam now dps this is also a good substitute for
its a very short game and definitely worth the time some of the bosses are really tedious and you re suddenly running and just trying to get to the next checkpoint before you die the jump scares were really fun because i played this with someone that jumped basically every time if you re not the type to fall for those then there will only be a really few insanely creepy moments would play again probably gonna get the downloadable content during the summer sale
i very recently had to re download this game due to my computer getting infected and forgot my previous username as a result i was not able to recover that account so i made a new one i am very happy with some of the changes such as the taxi being instant and available anywhere and in looking forward to redoing both the death song and gro icicle challenges having previously finished them however i am very disappointed that i keep having to shut my computer off in order to continue to play as it frequently gets stuck when in trying to complete my missions i love this game and i love the idea of it but this frequent freezing is extremely annoying i hope a patch is found soon
important notice to data two waiting time for players loading screen is too short disadvantage to all low performance slow personal computer and connection yer cafe in most of asia having all this problem is reconsider to add more waiting time courier hotkey inside setting is missing
early access review once upon a time there was a small little game called rob craft but now its known as pay process craft do i support this game not anymore is even when you pay you wont progress
early access review recent changes sure makes you question the future of free to play but overall this is still the best digital card game out there its fun and i feel like i can trust the developers and where they are taking the game
wouldn't recommend anyone play this its basically just a saggy glitchy pop animation version of maple story also level five in like thirty seconds what i mean i done really like grind games all that much but come on it shouldn't go that fast only real benefit it has is the tutorial takes about the same amount of time as the aforementioned levelling
this game is stupid done have thurs master wheel setup i have a thrust master ferrari four hundred and fifty eight italia and doesn't work so this just sucks done waste time downloading sixteen go of this crap
early access review this is probably one of the worst massively multiplayer online experiences live had ever and live been there for pretty much everything so store vanilla wow xiv go do term it center it center the bad i highly recommend staying away from this unfinished unpolished piece of dung the performance is abysmal i was getting fps in town open world as long as no one was around i had a constant sixty got into a small camp with a few people it dropped to is for a three year old game running be mon its twenty eighteen we expect better text in general was not properly translated in fact it was confusing i want sure what my skills did doing the tutorial was very confusing because of it it was telling me to add stuff to my bars that didst exist they had different names than what the actual quest text said the good the combat was actually entertaining it want a big deal like nothing revolutionary but it was enjoyable questing was pretty standard a pretty of is massively multiplayer online when it was working at least the voice acting was actually of and well done which is amazing for an asian massively multiplayer online honestly and the story though i didst really get very far seemed interesting conclusion the launch experience i wont really complain about i really wouldn't mind sitting in queue if i knew the game was worth it but its not it really int its not a playable acceptable product and honestly early access doesn't justify all the issues stay away specs i a owed to ghz is a bob ram
in not a big fan of mobs but this game is amazing the graphics a rent bad it runs smoothly it has many gods the game is strategic very fun i have been addicted to this game i can not stop playing it it has various game modes one of my favourites which were conquest its challenging and overall its the best mob ever one thing i done like i bought some gems on this game only when it was on sale and if a are getting this game do not buy gems till they re on sale they re are way to overpriced
early access review this is a much better game limo than hearthstone est or many other digital card games out there it is simpler than mtg but keeps many of the same rules that are abandoned by more recent card games such as playing mana and instants unfortunately it has already fallen into the problems that led me to quit hearthstone long ago the fact that there are very rare patches and balance changes in the past thirty four months there have only been a handful of new cards and only a couple small balance changes in the current age of sharing decks online this philosophy leads to extremely stale matches against many similar decks i think this could be a great game if the developers took a more liberal approach to making changes in the game but at this point even if they did the player base has dwindled significantly since it released in early access
one of the worst communities in the world there nothing wrong with the game itself but it is a multiplayer game and its a failed experiment getting into ranked games is literally cancer someone doesn't lock in game will start and someone will disconnect everyone will false report literally anyone its literally just a tutor on this earth and i cant stop playing save your soul and pass this up
early access review day heres my quick review summary without spoilers cdr should you buy it its free of ratings a a estimated playtime value over one thousands hours my playtime twenty hours replay graphics sound story controls one thousand and ten used mouse controller replay value very high bugs some as it is currently a but nothing daybreak overall value one thousand one hundred and ten of first impressions a a best thing pretty much a perfect fusion of magic the gathering and hearthstone liked card art premium card animations quick games huge amount of information about card types many very newbie friendly guides and tips not as heavily ring based as hearthstone disliked can only play on one board so far and campaigns are pretty cool but the narrative is captivating worst thing again i feel like the story is the weakest point of the game but the actual game play is very solid of funny a a there a few funny quotes in the game and quite a lot of the card mechanics can be pretty hilarious paragraph full review easily the best card game i have ever played on personal computer eternal is a freaking awesome fusion of magic the gathering and hearthstone i always needed a new card game after mtg kept releasing such king garbage computer games and hearthstone became one hundred about ring one hundred bullet decks and zero skill i only wish we had some more boards but they are coming different combat animations and some more dynamic music also i wish people like riparian played this and i guess he would if more people played it but seeing as he makes his money doing hearthstone videos he plays that instead honestly in just hoping this game stays the way that it is its not pay to win at all they literally throw you free cards and free packs for just playing the only things you absolutely have to pay for are cosmetics that give zero benefit playing against the a i or other people and for a couple of very specific kinds of cards available through the long campaigns but you can still easily buy these campaigns after a few days of gold grinding the gauntlet and playing against the a i conclusion live spent days reading up on the meta crafting decks and playing all the campaigns live played unbeatable tarot decks and live gotten my butt kicked tons of times in a row yet unlike hearthstone when i do lose i done feel salty or ripped off like i do every single time i play hearthstone hearthstone either makes me hate my opponent or hate myself live won and lost hundreds of games in eternal and maybe only two or three times i felt cheated as for the community there a little by here and there but nothing like what you sadly have to experience in hearthstone love it or hate it but seeing as we have no decent mtg games for personal computer or console and hearthstone has sucked for ages i will happily take this for as long as it int anything like hearthstone eighty eight a keep the goodies coming

early access review was a fun game some time ago now its pay town they also changed game play a lot and removed many cool features wouldn't play now even without all those pay walls
a maelstrom of anger fear disillusionment and sheer ecstasy data two is all these things and more you all learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match in that short span of time grudges will be born heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a or a martin epic and yet for all its emotional drama both highs and lows you all still yearn for more just learning to play is an adventure into masochism everyone begins as a dreaded noon unable to contribute anything but gold and experience points to the opposing team a few weeks later and they all have learned a few tricks where to place wards how to turn off auto attack in the options and crucially the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting give it a few months and they all be rolling with the regulars double stacking re crowing and gap will become part of their vernacular immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and calloused skin they'll have successfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the worlds burgeoning sports scene consider the football metaphor pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots strips and footballs rooney mess and near use in packed stadiums full of shouting people if all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself what a the point of playing if you don to feel something in the end data two delivers passion and fury in spades and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego just don to look at the item store your partners uncommon sense will never understand why you spent thirty five on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero
do not let the free to play aspect fool you what you done pay with your money you pay with your health used to be a great game now its a pro fascist propaganda tool toxic community mostly us servers intolerable dis balance in favor of fascist factions in tank battles so you re stuck grinding for silver even tho grinding is already bad in the game excessive grinding in rank five and up even with premium paid overpriced content biased in game admins who block users for no other reason than to just responding into chat unless they are pro fascists in which case even cursing is allowed and goes unpunished live seen it happen a lot content milking in you activate a booster only to be mismatched against much higher opponents just so you can waste your boosters without profit even if you pay real money for it once realistic balanced environment now makes legendary tanks look like cardboard boxes with turrets limited coop which is at times severely restricted to paid content and forces players to play arcade game mode to even participate while suppressing realistic gaming in the game so with limited cycled events installs an agent client that starts as a service while it is only understandable that foreigner may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and play this agent is at times aggressive and cannot be stopped it also conflicts with security tools much more wrong with this game i wont even bother just stay away from it the only thing that is somewhat fun is simulator flight battles and that in particular if you play with friends everything else has turned into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege spare yourself and your wallet do not make the same mistake and play something more meaningful if this game continues on this path it will die as war thunder within next sixty eight months may
if you want massive multiplayer first person shooter then this game is what you re looking for experience global warfare stretching from a kilometres in real time and with a wide range of vehicles and infantry classes this game is a whole lot of explosive fun
early access review so cute yet so spooky scared for life calling people cute is an insult now a i am humiliated for being so for adults ages seven and under
early access review recommend trying but not investing very much time or money in this flawed product good game but the shuffling algorithm is absolute trash you will get games where you don to draw any mana at all for multiple turns no matter how many you have in the deck the response from most people is that a variance and its good for the game the problem is this happens way too often as in frustratingly often it happens so often i have contemplated uninstalling the game multiple times however i have the sunken costs fallacy in full effect i have spent money and time so i don to want to see a waste in my investment i suffer on but quit my session shortly after starting due to these failures almost every time frustrated in such wasted potential from an otherwise fun game i would recommend people try this game but with the deck variance being so extreme compiled with a clearly terrible shuffling algorithm you will get a very large amount of no games games with no mana for you or the opponent equating an automatic loss for that party
early access review do not buy this game it is a price of poo also the grammar is completely incorrect in the game of which has absolutely no good content war mode is just a ripoff of counter strike go do not buy plus the scope doesn't even work and when i started up the game it was playing at a so i had to change the resolution while not even being able to read the words for the settings so i just had to click on some random stuff and eventually got it top well i have to admit the scope does actually work but you cant see through the scope so if it do ever get this game which you shouldn't you will have to play it like counter strike go but you will fail and that is why i deleted the entire game after only two hours messing with the resolution and mouse sensitivity ont buy
so overall the game is of could use lots of improvements such as when you roll two doubles in a row on a turn you should not have to go to the lost islands as it seems unfair instead our turn should just be skipped as well as the invite system hopefully we can extend the times in invite only games to make it longer and include a text chat for in game and allow more people in a lobby for more multiplayer fun and if you can make a bigger board for bigger parties and the betting system in the private games i rate this game five thousand five hundred and ten as i see potential in this game becoming a fun party game for large groups
love the i flight sim i hold a commercial fixed wing and helicopter dual rating and this is as close to as real flight dynamics as you can get on a personal computer digital combat simulator is a way progressing and improving the sim you just cant find anything like this out there when it comes to fighter simulations they just mad the us thirty three more realistic i cant wait for it to challenge my skills i have been a customer for years and will continue to be while on this plane of existence
early access review really good smash heroes remake i would say it is so fun developers are really nice people its free so try the game out my sponsor help steam community comgroupsarchreviews
if you like your study sims are willing to take a beating learning them give this a go you have nothing to lose with the free aircraft sadly you have a lot to lose now that de appear to have lost their respect for steam customers banning members for making any criticism against the game and their business decisions sorry digital combat simulator but you have lost my review
early access review good game i enjoyed keep in mind the game is early access the good thing this game did was fast paced action and classes the bad thing this game did is movement and weapons the ugly thing this game did was forging
enjoy not having the ability to upgrade anything and expect to have to pay real money for every gun you wish to own then this game is for you an obvious cash grab and a payt play style is completely unappealing installed it ran it and got as far as the the end of the tutorial before i realized i would never actually get to do anything other than kill one type of animal with a single gun you start with single bolt action rifle with thirty rounds and able to shoot mule deer if you are a free to play this is all you will ever do and this is all you will ever own and you cant even upgrade the sights without paying
the game is the best in its genre people need to understand the mentality of its game play you are not suppose to open and play it for hours its a side game a multi task game a coffee game to spend that ten minutes and look forward for the next day to send more dwellers into the wasteland build more facilities breed and expand its gonna be slow its gonna take time but it is worth it because this is your vault with your people some notes for new players the game is free but extremely fair you can cheat some premium items without any repercussions i would personally recommend it this is a casual game as you done need to worry too much if you make some mistakes but it has great depth and interesting mechanics to research and improve your vault and make better decisions with that being said it not without its flaws the managing of your dwellers can become a huge chore later on the user interface doesn't help since its build for mobiles but that is my single complain i wish they make some improvements there but i done see that happens especially since its exactly the same game everywhere is android bethesda personal computer client windows ten and steam versions unfortunately for those wondering you cant auto sync your game with the mobile version even though all the platforms share the same kind of save file that means that the game doesn't support auto sync but you can easily manually take your save files and use them in any other platform i played on different platform so i done yet have a lot of time fucking to display here but steam has achievements so may
early access review my previous review was a bit to long i am new to this game but here it is was having fun shooting others around the same level as me then when i hit level three was put in a game with people many many levels higher using tanks and better weapons i went from a kill death ratio of one death and five kills to eight deaths and two kills huh balance this already this game is a pay to win period its guard beyond belief you can say its in beta but its been in beta for three years face it the company doesn't give a crap about quality only your money there are many issues read the following reviews it really int worth playing at this point to me i am nothing but cannon fodder for those that paid for everything there a have it its a piece of junk
worst support ever done play this title i thought one of the mounts looked neat so i bought one of the downloadable content packs for the game for me and a friend about a week later my account got hacked and i lost all my resources i had gained in the game i issued a ticket and got a reply what there support said is that there was no way for them to see if the attack was from me or another in so they would not do the rollback i had high hopes for the game the idea is neat but if you are just going to be one of the many hacked accounts where no rollbacks are given what is the point in playing the game if eventually all your stuff will be gone and you will have to start over then what is the point perfect world has terrible support google around and you will see for yourself terrible response times and no real support when they do get back to you
i have been using several russian language simulators but it want working for me then a friend recommended data two i had a hard time in the beginning because i haunt learnt the meaning of the word yet now that i have a whole world has opened for me its so much when except for when a are playing against drop blood seeker axe viper sniper death judge or wiki would play again
live been playing this game for a while now and i can tell you that it is the best mob game out there in graphics and money wise and game play itself i would definitely recommend it
the game gives no instructions at all after scaring off two deer because i couldn't figure out how to crouch i find one i found no button to shoot it runs off into the hideous wilderness and disappears after five feet because of the horrible render distance i say this after playing on the absolute highest graphics available the screenshots and videos do not in any way reflect this price of crap you have to buy an insanely overpriced membership to get anything but the first gun or even play multiplayer and if you did get it any gun with a scope costs more than one hundred and fifty
all the reasons i can think of this game failed horrible lip syncing its a glitch simulator your parent must be less than three hundred and twenty four sheets are stone extractors and turns the stone into grass
i like the old school pixels goodness the variety of classes and mounts is fun too i am not sure how much girl i would commit there is much complaining in various forums id definitely check it out as free to play though
early access review hows this game even free such a cool game with no expensive reorder exclusives docs or monetization a full free horror game just freaking grab it already alright fair enough this is my review after a first look at spooky house of jump scares a really cool interesting and original psychological horror game with a cute and simplistic art style the game does a really good job of immersing you into the atmosphere with creeping looking corridors scattered notes and well timed music the jump scares are spaced enough to not be too common but they do come up at just the right time to scare your off the multiple kinds of enemies to doesn't allow you to get to comfortable but the progression through them is very well made and with a few mini games to add some subtle messages to it this game is totally worth the grab even more so since its free totally recommend it if you re still not convinced i played this game live on twitch so if you re interested to see how it looks heres the highlights help wow twitch only managed to make it to room three hundred before my heart gave out but in really pumped to continue big congrats to the author of this fantastic horror game
a for graphics a good selection on maps animals weapons hunting utilities even hunting dogs and so much more cherry on the top they keep improving this game on a regular base last but not least all this has his price
there seems to be a lot of negative reviews on steam about this game especially revolving around the pricing structure and while i agree that the price looks quite high i have to say that i think the items are so good that to me they re worth the outlay you get what you pay for and the quality here outshines any misgivings regarding prices graphically its stunning especially with everything turned high and running at sixty frames per second with twenty two cars on the track for which in referring to atm experience but the hot lapping in the base game with artificial intelligence turned on gives you an insight into what the finished game will feel like and in my opinion they have got it spot on i can only assume that the base game is yet to be optimised because i get lower first person shooter on the same tracks with only a couple of cars out than i do with the twenty two cars in a full race of atm same graphics settings for both but with a ten first person shooter drop in the base game sounds are incredible live never been so engrossed in the sounds of any game as this one and playing with headphones on just highlights the beauty of these cars game play is great especially on the get real setting a thought the artificial intelligence needs a little bit more speed as its currently too easy to catch and overtake in currently using a racer same tooth game pad and once setup it works perfectly but i can only imagine how much more fun a steering wheel would make this and its the game which will likely push me to make that commitment its that good that live bought pretty much most of the buy able stuff except for a couple of livery options within just a few days of trying it edit may twenty sixth after having set myself up with some decent hardware to get the most out of driving games i can say that this is my favourite driving experience on the personal computer i own most if not all of the personal computer racing sims but there something about race room that makes it very special to me and that the feeling you get from the overall atmosphere that this sim creates from the sounds to graphics to driving feel once set up correctly this is such a cool experience with artificial intelligence that can keep up and give you a thrilling racing experience may
early access review the old here is that if you re looking for something less broken and trash than pub but you done quite want to play footnote with twelve year old then i guess this game has you covered of and no you re not that good its just that this game backfill matches with bots this is another battle royal game its right there in the title right next to realm realm royal int really doing anything new or exciting outside some minor tweaks to the game play of your standard battle royal game you drop into the map from an airship you land find chests to get weapons and abilities then you kill your way to being the last person or squad standing one thing realm royal does do differently is the class system in similar games you more or less drop in as the same person no one person has some edge over the other except for skill and mastery of the glitches in the game in realm royal however there are four classes mage assassin hunter and warrior they each play the exact same and can use the same weapons and abilities however they do have small buffs to certain weapons if used and drop into the map with different starting movement abilities the mage can fly the assassin can blink the hunter and dodge roll and the warrior has a super jump there are some other movement abilities such as invisibility or a charge attack but those will have to be forged during the round or found in random chests the other thing the game does slightly differently is the lives system in other games when you take too much damage you go into a bleeding or down state and have to be revived by a squad mate or in the case of solo queueing die instantly you can be further damaged in this downed state and killed but eventually you'll bleed out if someone does revive you in realm royal however when you go down you just turn into a chicken you can still move and take cover albeit with reduced movement and unable to defend yourself and eventually you'll be back in fighting shape if you a rent killed while you re in chicken form you can be chickened three times before you die for good but then you can still be revived by a squad member at a forge granted they can afford the revive and a rent killed before the re timer counts down i will say that the choice to put loot inside independently loo table chests is a great idea it stops me from missing things on the ground because i didst notice the muddy black texture on top of the muddy brown and it stops the friendship destruction by making them independently loo table so there no debating over who gets what you can share the loot if you done want it and the game smartly places a pickup timer to stop people from stealing your if you turn your back for a microsecond but after the timer runs out its free game this system is actually pretty good i think they need to do a better job letting me know which loot is mine in a pile of new items but overall its decently well implemented i mentioned above that this game backfill with bots this is something i didst know going in but became really obvious after a single match bots often run straight at you and either have precognition and aim bot or get stuck on geometry and just eat bullets until they die this game doesn't have a lot of players right now so i imagine a large portion of the matches i played were over half filled with bots often the last few players were the only real humans in the match to begin with in not really upset with this because it means that you wont be queueing forever if the game cant matchmaker enough people but it is something to be aware of heres the thing right if you want another battle royal game there probably worse options out there somewhere but right now this game only does just enough to differentiate itself that id only recommend it if you have a couple of friends willing to download it with you
making you and your best friend worst enemies since war craft three mob game where you will feed for your first fifteen hundreds hours of game play your teammates will hate you and you will further by play the games loss on them for your next one thousands hours of game play you will complain on forums and in game alike how your team is bringing you down and you will a a a a a about leo hell which doesn't exist welcome to data two you re stuck here now
a diabolo style game that seems to have made a ton of fun design decisions i vote it best in class there are many game varieties and i recommend that everyone race as often as you can its a game the achievements are challenging no matter which level you are playing something great could drop at any moment a ton of character build variety you can find a basic item and turn it into an incredibly better item with innovative game currency and relatively cheaply easy to group when you are in the mood the game is frequently updated and the developers are active in the community truly free to play support is responsive the in game arm or and weapon visual effects that you can buy are more expensive than i would like is dollars us in some cases update i deleted the bit about lag being a problem if you have good internet then the newly added lockstep improvements make the game play super smooth and responsive so many great changes with the recently released version twenty the awakening one of the few companies that is continually giving the community what they request
early access review the game is fun but its full of find boobs who does not how to play mobs ply put a server in the start to ask if they have played mobs and how good they are and make a tutorial for them ply
this game rules the variety of specimens makes for great game play constantly keeping you focused the notes are a great narrative device the story is great and the cultural references are awesome boss fight at the end is a little too easy but fun none the less one thing that could improve the game if you kept the notes and could view them at anytime once you had picked them up also spoilers a a sequel with the player from this as specimen fourteen like in the bad ending would rock with like a portable cat dos or something of the sort ultimately a great game nine hundred thousand one hundred and ten
early access review amazing game without a doubt the best free to play collectible card game that actually doesn't lie when they say is free to play you can get to the top without spending a dime and building competitive decks in a month or two the game play can be boiled down to say like magic with the aesthetic of hearthstone also the deus take advantage of this being a virtual game by creating cards and effects that would be otherwise hard or impossible to play on reality physical format once you get through the tutorial and all that jazz go for the free trial twitch prime and claim the eternal package that contains like thirty our packs and join the discord people in there is really helpful and will aid you to get the ropes of the game so try it out in the worst case that you done like how it is played you can uninstall is free one note tho do not buy packs as you try to build your collection play draft eternal equivalent of arena instead you open five packs choose cards and by the end of the run you get to keep all the cards you picked even if you are bad at it you can just pick the more rare cards and still get good and better value out of it
take care people once you get into it its like you just signed a pact with devil done know what in doing with my life anymore i got crush on a eight thousand five hundred and ten grill we talk a lot and but do to wont let me get any closer than that shes taken too fol
this game with its cute little out of the wall popups that scared the living light out of me i like it very much i haven played it lately but this is a very good game i like how its a funny jump scare game and it is very very fun but the story is pretty sad so good luck and have fun in the rooms a
early access review the good multiple soldier classes to choose from meaning multiple play styles to utilize and select from separate resources for soldiers and assault teams the ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skills to specialize them how you wish the ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicles by investing time and experience into the previous levels the ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat such as faster reloading reduced damage taken and carrying more ammunition three nations to choose from allowing different gear between factions with few exceptions each soldier can earn more for fighting based on their rank providing an incentive to continue to improve and rank up the ability to give a generals gear to other soldiers of the same faction once said soldier becomes a general the bad each soldier starts with no experience base gear and must play through the same tutorial to start earning credits in battles just by playing experience gain is painfully slow with gains and rewards becoming more insignificant over time until they start becoming not only more minuscule but more time consuming as well each experience tree not only unlocks different perks but different items and do not intersect often holding new items in the middle or later stages of the trees each nation unlocks different things in different orders meaning some nations will be able to unlock better equipment at different points such as tanks at least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the generals part of the game unless you purchase a general or high ranked soldier using real world cash all weapons vehicles classes and assault teams can be purchased using real world currency the only exception is ribbon levels and perks which can be unlocked faster using boosters or a premium account each player is thrust into matches with high level players randomly upon reaching rank three with one soldier meaning they often face off against vastly superior enemies very early on even the balanced matches are not balanced because soldier numbers on each faction in battle can be uneven to an extent all three factions are treated as separate entities making a game based off of the second world war seem more like a free oral game spawn points can be easily camped by enemy players using tanks making for a highly dissatisfying battle vehicles can be spawned sideways upside down or in the immediate line of fire making high action points a nightmare to use especially when said points are the only remaining ones to spawn from weapons can be modified to allow for instant one shot capabilities no matter where the victim is hit frame rate and connectivity is a huge issue especially during high activity in small areas weapons can be modified to allow for extreme fire rates making it nigh impossible to react before one is killed allied players are able to repeatedly kill their own teams with little to no recourse noted as of yet other than a minor loss of experience gaining any type of currency is slow and tedious on top of the high cost of modified and specific gear players can join battles late and end up earning absolutely no reward for participation even if they play a significant role in the battle players can buy the ability to equip two perks a fourth weapon and gain a boost to resources and experience earned through a premium account certain perks either do not seem to work right or are considered overpowered such as the ability to remove the kill camera which is actually the ability to see where you were killed from players can enter matches in which they will be forced to fight against tank players even if their team have none and oftentimes cannot do anything about it other than be crushed this happens even in the balanced game modes in game wars last an average of twenty three days requiring players to select their server and faction all over again every time one ends even if they themselves did not participate paratroopers cannot jump out of a drop plane that is currently plummeting without incurring a suicide penalty meaning whomever shot down the plane gets a free reward for killing them edit you might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit but you still die instantly once its started to plummet fighter planes have little to no variety and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls players earn a minuscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing and would need to play one battle every day for two hundred and ninety our days in order to purchase the lowest ranked war bond in the shop which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to three hundred and ten days worth of first battle bonuses over half a year meanwhile the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of three hundred and fifty days worth costs under eight us for whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in early release still please note that this is a personal opinion and an early release review on top of that meaning that as more patches are added this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time as it stands though i cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highly experienced or skilled player but also the one who throws money at it and yes i did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point
this game is great but it is so boring to the point where i was yawning while playing this game the huge big flaw is that the early duels are way to easy i have seen no one except for the legend aries put a card down in defence mode or put down a spell or trap card if you go second in any battle you basic win if the game decides to give you monsters you can throw down and not just spell or trap yes that can actually happen i lost twice do to that happening like i said its way to easy early on done know about later on but when i fight thirty some different people not player versus player i should not see the same monster over and over just thrown in attack position with complete lack of any absolutely none not a single piece of the artificial intelligence doing strategy no spells no traps and no defence this makes almost half the spell and traps cards useless because you beat them so hard you done even need spells or traps except player versus player where spells and traps are really important done just do what the artificial intelligence do this is basic a battle in this game the artificial intelligence throws down one card in attack position and that it then its your turn to basic steam roll the artificial intelligence with actual good cards with traps and spells can i ask who thought that having only three spots to place you monster straps and spells on the field this has no regard to strategy even against the legendary due list because they only rarely put down spells and traps even if they do that half the time they done even use them so just keep attacking and you win you can win even without tribute summons and fusion summons just use the lvi four and below and you can basic beat almost every due list except for player versus player which actually has you going against people that know how to play well player versus player is so terrible as well its good only if you can stay in a match to completion and not get disconnected and get counted as you lost the game even though you didst quit then the game kicks you out and you lose just how in what world is this system even fair the artificial intelligence is pathetic and the only good duels are player versus player if you can actually finish and not glitch out this game is good all it needs is a artificial intelligence update and change the field so you can put down five monsters or five spells and traps and put in an actual shuffle code so we done get useless traps and spells when we need lvi four and under monsters plus the player versus player fix so its not glitchy and you cant just drop out and lose these things should be easy to fix take the game fucking a a a even after thirteen years that game still has the best first person shorter artificial intelligence show me a first person shooter game that has better artificial intelligence than fucking a a a the point is if a thirteen year old game still has better artificial intelligence than every first person shooter than this artificial intelligence should be even better or at least as good so they just done throw one monster down in attack once that happens you win they can never get the control back these make it so whoever goes second pretty much instantly wins do to the huge advantages you get for going second the player who goes first dost get to draw a card at the beginning of the game and cant attack but the second player gets to draw and attack after the second player goes then the first player gets to draw which in hoping i done need to explain how stupid that is all this game needs is a couple of updates and fixes and you have a great almost perfect game but for now stay away from this boring trash
early access review completely the same as counter strike go but more fun and also free great game to waist time in anticipation for something runs well find yourself spending hours playing to unlock a beast sniper and having the round end ont the best to play with friends as teammates do nothing in this game but sit there and steal your kills free better then counter strike go runs great a great time multiplayer can be repetitive and annoying same thing as counter strike go
early access review gunplay fun and overall fun however whoever is in charge of designing the maps has no idea what he or she is doing at all the maps in this game are all horribly designed please fix
why this why mobile game on steam i remember playing original world of tanks couple of years ago i grinder so in hard to get better tier tank matches took so long and you were getting so little experience and credits i finally managed to get to tier five american a sherman air only to realize how much that tank sucked and then i saw how much more grinding was before me in a bad tank to get anything better thanks but no wot is awful then i played the mobile version on my phone and had many more tanks in shorter time also grabbed free tank slots on promos so in not that limited this game looks rather bad is dumped down but its at least a bit more reasonable in grinding fest it could be better but its still fun especially that you can play on mobile and have same account game still requires a lot of grinding though
i got this game back when it was a paid model and i have to say i do not regret paying for it the deus have been very active and were very generous to the people that help support it when it was being sold before it went free to play thanks for a great game and keep up the great work almost twenty eighteen and still going strong
i truly consider this the great sequel to diabolo ii being free play is even greater but do not compare this game with diabolo iii for they are different games diabolo iii is a game in its own right it deserves the attention for it is very polished and well conceived path of exile has the exact style of diabolo ii and although i done agree with the spamming trade system complicated class skill tree and inability to re roll skill points easily i do praise the developers for starting the game and continuing diabolo i is dark legacy in a different lore and graphic engine deserves a one thousand and ten from a diabolo fan like myself
early access review its a smash bros type game and is pretty easy to get used to the controls but time to time you will learn that timing and pace is important if you want to climb the ladder in rank other than that have fun playing with friends or people online warning this may destroy friendships May
early access review all talking is text no voice acting intro is hilariously bad once you get out of hell you fight this overpowered demon night who then throws you ten thousand miles and it shows your body car wheeling through the air and its downright ridiculous i giggled but what really put me off is the controls and the names i mean really robin the hood and mouse look is only possible if you click and hold and arrow keys just make you turn or go straight i understand this game was engineered to work for mobile as well but it should have been a port not a main focus would only recommend for the most basic easiest to impress player
so far this is the best economics simulator to i could find online i have seen or been able to simulate door to door selling monopolies pawn shops and one of artwork masterpiece selling its all in the game and you can trade on websites or on a server dedicated to it i cant believe someone could duplicate the feeling so well also a bunch of people on my friends list insist that i just have to try the first person shooter mode of the game maybe ill get to that someday
early access review fantastic potential really fun to play just join a game earn points for kills and use points to buy guns and armour in that game hope the gun balancing stays the same and they done implement a pay to win policy on the guns fingers crossed could do with some bigger maps and a bit stricter policing of hackers which often ruin multiple games in a row that said its free its fun and its definitely worth a try
early access review when i was eight years old i used to play the hell out of as games specifically dragon able i then moved on to adventure quest worlds which pretty much sold me into the ideas of mos now this this is pretty okay but falls short in its current state its not the best game out there but in sure what its lacking will be brought in as the beta progresses one thing that is bugging me right now is that you cant change your characters eye color it is always blue for some reason another thing that is bugging me is that there is no dodge button this may be because i am too used to guild wars two but i feel like this is an massively multiplayer online where that feature would be perfect active dodging is always a plus rather than in based dodge because it requires skill another thing bugging me quite literally are the bugs in this game sometimes the user interface messes up and keeps tracking quests when they are abandoned sometimes it messes up by tracking quests live already done its really annoying now the last thing i will talk about are the graphics i realize that this game was made to be cross platform but i see no excuse as to why this game must have horrible graphics on personal computer when personal computer is the main platform that this games player base plays on hopefully these things do get sorted out so i can finally relive my childhood happily may
one of the very best online card games more depth and less random than hearthstone game is really rewarding with cards and gold single player solo arena is a fun feature to play at the beginning
early access review the game was so much better when i first played like three years ago now i have a five minute ban because of the new beta i bet they rushed to get released i couldn't connect to a damn game because someone keeps getting disconnected and when we did get disconnected we get a game abandon cool down i literally have the whole thing recorded from trying to join a game to getting kicked and banned
early access review the foundation of this game is awful meaning no fixes they will do will ever fix that problem too lazy to write a real review but just want to add to the stats and help people avoid this game rip my soul
early access review this game is suck and awesome the part of suck from this game is so hard to earn experience you must kill a player then you gonna earn ten experience the part of awesome from this game is this game is free and i spend half hour to find a in single match
early access review like this game its fun i like the art style and i do like the simplicity its addicting haven spent a dime and haven felt i needed too though i will probably throw them a few bucks for the work its beat so expect bugs but nothing a re log wont fix the user interface is getting changed as well as most other things i have issues with when to comes to the personal computer version i hope it gets popular the community is friendly and helpful when it comes to mobs and quests and the mobs can be tough which i like instead of pushover like in some mos
it takes a little dedication to get used to the game the handling is sometimes a little quirky especially when new to the game though when figuring out how the steering exactly works and lap times are going down the game really stimulates you to continue whether on the same track in the same car or in the same competition i didst buy any arp currency yet so i haven bought any new cars or tracks but already i managed to spend over twenty hours into the game and i done play games that much so for me that a lot if racing is really something you enjoy i would recommend you check it out probably a lot of you will rage quit out because the handling is a thing to get used to however with a little bit of practice even the two free tracks are good to drive on and even when experienced those tracks are great fun and still full of challenge nevertheless if racing is not your type of game this might not appeal to you fully
the game is alright however it would be soon much better if you just had to pay for the game instead of paying to win you simply cant progress without spending more money than this game is worth its a fun game however its kind of annoying with the pts aspect
early access review be careful with privacy and data collection the developer intends to collect all the information you have to offer and store it outside the european union where you are not protected by law do not give it freely to them beware of this trick i made it to the start page where you are asked to accept the privacy and data collection and declined therefore not playing the game
one of all my eng its not the best in the world so forgive my grammar mistakes to the game now if you are starter you will see it all good in there graphics game play sounds and most of the players are very corporate with you the problems start when you reach level eight and higher then you start battle with all the payers in the world force you to do the same if you want to survive in there let me make my self clearest if you are level eight or ten or after five hundred hours level twenty and more you will face players with level sixty eighty or one hundred and then the party start there is not voodoo with no way you can blow up some player in that rank no matter the nation or what kind of tank are you have or they have i found my self shot plenty of time boys with level sixty and up like i say i fired at them at least thirty shells all kind of shells at every possible weak point the enemy tank have and still no damage in i matter of fact what damage no damage at all and if the enemy shout back on me god help me if i find my pieces out there one enemy shot is more than enough to blow you out i ask about that some others players in there and out there and most of them have some cheap excuses that i am not use the right shell i done shout at the right point and staff like that i try to explain to them that i shout more than thirty times at every possible point and i am not playing alone out there i have witness some friends of mine and all the others try not to see it or understand it finish in this my complains is huge and no good game play or the thousands of payers in there cant hold me for reject this game for good if you have money and want to be the best then that game is for you if you want to try to play with your balls then avoid it like i plague so black for me and i am not suffer to be i puppet out there i want to play equal and fair with everybody else
early access review to ensure my sanity every time a card board cut out pops up i run in to it and kiss it but bout the game i would a that it is one of the scariest games i have ever seen i would give it a one thousand and ten but if you have heart problems or a are easily scared i recommend that a definitely do not play this game
early access review this game is fantastic if you play counter strike this is a really nice change from it the gunplay is amazing especially the shots just feel satisfying if you re looking for a super realistic game this int it but if you re looking for a general shooter with of graphics and nice first person shooter this is the one for you you cant go wrong its ftp after all cons not many servers russian and us only no competitive game mode only ski not many features pros small download great gunplay fast load up from my desktop i can be in a game in around twenty seconds its still early alpha one am this game may have changed since this post may
do not waste your time game is very glitchy done spend any money on this game my entire vault after five days bricked and is gone contacted support for refund five days after purchase and was denied for an entire week they finally add items back instead of refunding and one of the packages instantly disappears after i redeem with none of the items applied to my account worst experience with steam and a game ever in going to go outside now and smash my head against a wall its more rewarding than this game
absolute trash artificial intelligence always lands on the perfect tile for the time either to purchase it just before you land a turn later to pay up or to magically avoid eight of nine tiles you own twenty times in a row of ten players use some game engine she so you land in jail on first turn and miss all property tiles the first eighty turns until they have the entire board and you have nothing at all play a few games you'll catch on to the bullshit quick edit take my advice and done join games with any players from or in brazil every person i suspected of cheating just magically happen to be from brazil all nine cheaters all from the same place who have guessed attempt number two started a game and got three guys from france all friends is just me all attacking just me some guy who used special characters to avoid a steam ban name was vulgar for except circles around the vulgar text and the arrow was an actual arrow all of which cant be typed on a keyboard his soc puppet you and his other soc puppet yes of is only me every chance card went against my three very poor one house cities all while they avoided each other and didst give a in fact to push things further as soon as id lost the two puppets forfeit the game giving to untenable text name vulgar no spaces all the chip attempt number three faced one of two hundred and twenty eight thousand idiots on steam named tape face with a black hair black white stripes shirt image that apparently hundreds more idiots on steam use incident he landed repeatedly on world tour five times in a row in a in row and consecutively as in so many times he went from no property to owning the entire same line london to new york yes picked each tile and landed on world tour after each purchase no fail then landed on chance from new york purchase on doubles and drew select city for world championships which i then landed on london which just happened to be a festival that he just chose a turn before to be the championships yes all turn by turn no fail no pause pure impossible the rest the game he landed two in seven turns on a twenty five thousand property while i landed upwards of three times per pass on those same properties london to new york its always the cheating in dip that use either non keyboard text in their name so you cant report block act or the choose a name that used by a million other users with an image a million other idiots use that use cheats and stupid
i used to love this game a ton i even spent a little money two years later me this game sucks everything is unbalanced and buggy the game has a depressing and weird feel to it now developers have really de this game up short version used to be fun now it sucks
team fortress two is a great game with a great community what i love about this game is the large variety of styles classes and ways teleport play each class not to mention the large amount game modes i would recommend this game to anyone who is a gamer three love this game
this is the game live invested more time in game and planning than in any other game ever amazingly good and huge game updates keep it interesting and somewhat balanced all the time and there is always something to do or at least to try there are not enough time to even try all the interesting builds because new ones pop up all the time poe community in game and in geddit are the most awesome ever if you have problem you can ask for help or buy services like hard boss kills from other players you can play with up to five friends through game or just some time mapping with your best friend or you can be the ultimate lone wolf and maybe play in ssh where you cannot even trade with anyone other than the in game vendors and masters skill tree where to begin with that it is huge and complex and huge there is always something new to learn and its good thing in these games you can go different routes to same notable and decide to take he instead of damage or change it later if you just wanted to try out something there are million choices needed to be made considering only the skill tree options are almost limitless tho some decisions are a bit more build enabling than the others you can invest only few hours or couple thousands of hours and i promise that you wont be in the position where you can say that you know everything and or you have tried everything new challenges skills unique and other mechanics which affect the game and how you can should play it keeps updating every once in a while and new leagues start about in every three months thumbs up good game you should really give it a try
decent port of the mobile game audio sounds higher quality and more crisp extra information on the sides is nice would be been nice to see a little bit more utilization of personal computer hardware but its a mobile game on personal computer so i cant complain importing data is as easy as importing to any other device so all my progress is synced with my phone and tablet only thing that kinda bothering me is the lack of japanese voices the english and korean voices are there but not the japanese voices for some reason
i like this game its not poor wot only boobs cant play this this is harder to play whit android phone this game its great and i like it so much its better than wot whit less cheaters
excellent game i much prefer this to min craft its fun to build and its fun to explore there is a great selection of blocks some available as downloadable content but i have been playing for years and still have not finished building everything i want with the blocks that come free the game looks great for a block game making wandering and exploring very fun there is a daylight dynamic to the monsters you can encounter but they cant dig and never blow up your buildings so early on you can easily avoid monsters you are not ready to encounter yet it has a few bugs but they are easily overshadowed by the fact that this game is fun i have played this for one hundred and thirty hours so far which is about one hundred hours more than any other game i have ever owned
cant even get into this game without it crashing nothing but a complete joke pick a god damn act up absolutely pathetic would never recommend this to anyone nothing but a joke and a complete waste of time
pay two win basic sums up the game to get sub classes pay to use most of the stuff a get in starter gear pay to win coupons in the game a get from starter gear still need to pay little explanation about some things but other things greatly explained so yah pay two win
of so for the past few games live been logging onto trove only to find out i cant click anything that being said i cant craft anything have to force exit the game and cannot join my friends parties on top of that the camera glitches so bad ill be running somewhere and suddenly the camera will turn around has this happened to anyone and or how do i fix this problem because i really like trove but with these problems in getting sort of annoyed to the point i done want to play anymore i used to play this game no problem and not pay for anything i would just grind to get what i needed now you re telling me i need to put my life savings into this game why
for the record i played this game for at least six hundred hours before the steam launch the only reason i started playing was because i happened to get the alien are a skin right after beta had ended i didst expect much from this game at first but since it is a mob and the only other mob live played was dead island epidemic i wanted to try it i done regret my decision at all i love this game so much and i will never stop playing it i usually never put money towards any free game but this was the first exception and i defiantly got my moneys worth the only cons i see for this game are the same ones that are present in any multiplayer game bad salty players and people that complain about the cost of things because mommy credit card cant handle it anymore golf and happy smiting
my opinion understand the negative review but i have spent a lot of money on this game but that because i enjoy it you can play whiteout spending money they give new free species to hunt every week and if you want a good budget experience you have to pay like twenty five at the start for a good rifle recommend the suite recommend bone crocket and callers and then ten per three months if you done want to play it anymore you can just stop paying so that is my opinion have fun and hunt on
do you like planes and tanks are you tired of games like world of tanks constantly on its free two play player base did war birds not have enough variety for you then this is the game for you how does it control it has both arcade and realistic game modes to suit anyone needs a very fair free to play system tons of interesting battles play this game
pay to win garbage fun until you run out of medallions and you have to grind in assault mode against people who have better units than you pros colourful fun for a little while good conceptions pwn ear impossible for new players gets too grind
i cant play the game because the tutorial is glitches for me and i cant fix it there are only thirty two cards in my collection but you need fifty for a deck but the game thinks i have fifty
its incredibly fun in a realistic worthies shard but rewarding sort of way the planes are lots of fun to fly by themselves the missions are different and keep you on your toe you done need crazy expensive controllers to have a good time with this games use keyboard and a twenty five log tech extreme three dimensional pro flying with friends is awesome you can edit the single player campaign to make them coop always people to fly with in multiplayer and most seem to be willing to help boobs like myself a little advice expect to get rest the first few times you play the learning curve is steep but well worth it once you figure out how to play
my mother had purchased the fifty membership pass after adding funds she got the email confirming the purchase but after the wait time was over the items were not transferred to my account and i tried to get help through a ticket i received a response but it never went farther than that updated and restructured the report i made because the grammar and other things were hurting my eye my stance on this game is still negative but i will still play it without purchasing anything
good simple fun graphics are excellent community if friendly and noninvasive best of all its free while there are micro transactions you done need them if you re patient
early access review believe that this game has a too soon of potential especially to outweigh some of the other competition the fact that this is on steam where many people heavily rely upon to play the majority of their games the chances of someone trying out the game increase tremendously in addition it will be much easier for the developers to get purchases of battle passes and whatever else they may add due to the fact that the steam wallet is much more flexible as people are more likely to have leftover money after purchasing other games or items on steam this is my list of pros and cons during early access specifically alpha pros game play pros clean user interface easy to understand symbols balanced classes for the most part and also from what i can tell marked points on the minimal show up as transparent pillars in the map very useful at all stages of the game a different style of dropping no parachuting which is a nice touch for the pace of the game dispersion of chests loot is nice as you wont find things too close or too far away from each other variety of weapon choices class specific weapons abilities if you kill another player you will not be able to use their stuff if it is class specific tiers of weapons armour common uncommon rare it center forging is very unique allows for game play to be more in depth toggle able mount vehicle for longer distance travel i like how it disables when you go indoors as well as the cool down damage indicators pretty good hit registration for its first week of play map pros very detailed map with different biome like an ice one forest desert it center in the four corners graphics are pretty nice for a free game topography is shown which is super cool lets you know how elevated a surface is so you can know if one spot is a mountain or not it center labels for places in the map as well as specifics where every forge in the map is and block coordinates a a by it center other pros region selection for matchmaking not pay town party finder for those who do not just want to fill lobby custom table options for crosshair reticles audio video it center controller support for those who would like a challenge i guess hama player rating does not affect matchmaking queue as of now however i would like there to be a list of ranks so we know how were rated report feature voice chat i personally haven used it that much but it seems fine the horse is very buff and the chicken is awesome a cons game play cons limited inventory to two weapons the three max abilities is entirely fine no indication of weapon statistics after picking up when opening your inventory the only option is to swap its slot from one or two is now in the game no indication of the flight path before dropping no manually reviving teammates the chicken mechanic is nice but not always ideal sound cues are not always accurate or loud enough this goes for me as well as a couple of my other friends who all have different headsets turtle beach log tech racer it center when opening chests potions and other items may appear stuck inside of it which makes it tricky to find an angle that lets you pick it up auto pickup when running over it now unable to drop potions you can drop them with ease now only third person five thousand and fifty sometimes these royals are better or worse with only teleport i am personally fine with both happily moving zone however that expected from an alpha game map cons minor bugs with the landscape live run into a couple floating bushes or things didst render properly uncommon though also note that i have the highest graphics settings no current zoom mechanic on minimal other cons no current a or common questions people may have regarding mechanics may lead to confusion or people to believe something that is false such as the chicken thing and dis enchanting basics as well as patch notes in game good stuff model stiffness sometimes the animations just stop and the character goes into the good those fixed now no color blind mode yet which would be extremely helpful for people like me who have difficulties differentiating the coloured tiers of items tabbing out can take some time occasionally crashing the game not sure how often this will occur taking all of this into consideration the game seems to be going in a pretty good direction i hope that the developers are very responsive throughout development and later in the games progress i personally am not a huge fan of battle royals i tend to play them more casually however i expect this game to be pulling in some more of my hours overall this game is a nine hundred and ten and you should definitely consider trying it out especially since it is free mAy
early access review hello if you hear me can you urban me maybe you done understand i am from lithuania and ten for a video game that is not very popular or amazing no hate your game is challenging and fun and ten for a free game is a lot i am not like you you millionaires
created fractured space is a game about driving your gigantic spaceship into epic five versus five team battles on vast maps with sectors of up to one hundred kilometres length there are currently thirty three ships available to play where they are split into three manufacturers which each boast their own distinctive art style and unique systems games can be played in the two currently available game modes conquest and frontline where the first feels somewhat like a good old mob and the latter like a fast king of the hill match with base capture elements ships can vancouver almost completely free though you are unable to roll and only limited tilting is possible though this goes to ensure that certain ships can function the way they were designed and combat gets more challenging more on that later movement between sectors is achieved via a phase relocation also called jump which keeps both your orientation and momentum fractured space features a very high depth of mechanics which might not jump your thought immediately and will require some getting used to such as the concept of arm or and breaking arm or causing you to take increased damage from enemy fire fractured space due to its high depth delivers lots of potential for very tactical play and thus has huge potential to become an sport in the future here are my personal scores for the game graphics nine hundred and ten the unreal engine delivers again and so do the artless from edge case games beat full look sound solid eight hundred and ten despite the usual no sound in space thing fractured space features a really immersive soundscape depth nine hundred and ten in terms of depth fractured space beats most mimosas live yet seen may be a bit to much for the casual player character design nine hundred and ten the ships you play feel very very unique and become so even more with load outs and crew game play seven hundred and ten game play is a bit intuitive at times but a well done tutorial helps with the tremendous depth of the game now do i recommend fractured space hell yeah its one of the most revolutionary space shooters live ever seen and the unreal engine makes it just so nice to play and look good the game is fair and balanced no cheaters to bee seen since the game started there is payed content to the game but this completely restricts itself to skins giving you the cool looks but nothing else while you can also buy credit boosters to simply get your next ship faster that being said a more expensive ship doesn't mean you will have an easier time having a newer more expensive ship gives you absolutely no advantages over other people now there are some players i definitely done recommend to touch fractured space because the game takes quite some effort to be successful in so just quickly jumping in for the pure own age will likely not work out May
fighting depression was hard really hard i had to suffer through life being billed by fats and a brats until i found this game this game opened the lock to my heart i never felt so alone again i now have virtual waifs and playing with only one hand this has cured my depression and lost my parents trust best game in humanity one thousand one hundred and ten
a very fun alternative to crafting games such as min craft its very original and i can respect that all worlds are online making playing with friends easy the way its set up encourages you to venture out for that one thing you need in order to craft that one thing that will help you this game has a huge variety of creatively designed mobs and in glad to see if they add even more to the game
honestly a really fun grinder game with lots of different tactics and styles you can set up so many kinds of builds the game itself progresses relatively quickly compared to some clicker games not to mention while this is free it doesn't force its pay elements down your throat rather its something i personally bought a bit of to support the team behind the game give it a shot
i actually really like this game i play it with friends and we play it a lot for all the people out there that complain about the game being too expensive the free to play side of the game is basically a demo to see if you enjoy the game if you like it you can buy the fifteen membership which gives you all the basic essentials needed to play the game the game needs money to survive and become more developed its not like the game could be successful if no one bought anything and everything was free i think the fifteen is well worth considering you can hunt everything and they give you everything you need to hunt everything but that just my opinion well developed and updated game nine thousand five hundred and ten scary as when charged by a bear
this reminds me of valves new artefact game everyone was excited for half life three but they got a crappy data card game everyone was excited for elder scrolls six but then we got this anyone else see the similarity its not a bad card game though either
early access review the new patch ruined the game for me the damage changes has made my mage feel extremely weak i run out of mana after thirteen mobs killing one mob takes freaking game going a bad direction now
this game was fun until the job costumes wore off and the realization that any of the actual costumes must be paid for with actual money final sunk in basic to build the character you wanted from the start you must buy buy and buy all of the costumes for maximum customization would be a good game but still would not recommend
early access review was fun until they blew it first they got my money for one game and then on a single monday night turned it into an entirely different game probably done with hire
if you do not like grinding games this is definitely not one for you that being said if you like to collect items and different cosmetic styles this is definitely a game for you they have recently added player versus player beta and shadow towers like small raids and the game keeps updating a tough i think the game is great no game is without their own problems server downtime is one of those but and this is a big but the servers are getting more stable every patch the game has come a long way since last i played it and i have gotten hooked on it again a tough i can get random crashes for no reason the game is fast to restart annoying yes but docent matter that much but a long as you send reports the issues will be fixed eventually you can also build like in min craft and make music and so on there exist a lot of clubs to just hang around in and explore what others have built all in all this is a great game
product received for free early access review fantastic cooking fungal you are dropped into a random part of the map after a loading screen of clouds first thing you will notice is the game is actually really decent looking with odd running animations the game already has parkour and many many guns and pots and pans to cover your a opening doors is very loud which is good and bad it might be louder just on your own client the game only has thirty people in it for the moment which seems to be great for the map size the map is fantastic and looks a lot like france germany in world war two which is not surprising as this is a world war two mod the guns shot well but could do with some improvements the end game is scary as hell weird noises that sound like you re mothers bedroom on a sunday night the starting screen leaves a lot to be dis red but its still early days the best thing about the game i would say is it has its own spin on it and no boring building to fri would give it a solid seven hundred and ten needs more work and all that but its great fun
best game this game is the best horror game of the timeline holy my dad still hits me though
a cool hunting game i can confidently say looks good feels good and most of all you can hunt with your friends now for what i really think this game should not be free to play because its really not you have to pay if you want to have anything more then one gun and two licenses for animals you will never find it should be called free to download because its far from free to play all to make money i guess false advertising to draw you in then its pay to play from there i do not recommend this game because of its pay to play style if there was a up front cost i would have a different opinion
early access review much better to have algorithm for auto equip the pick up weapon parts compare to circle the polygon is harder to determine if player is in the safe zone or not very interesting reflection algorithm concept for water metal and floor
been playing smite since beta and it get better every single patch the art work the modes and the new gods are incredible since they are all tied to real life myths and legends also hire is the king of value the god pack gives you every single god in the game and every single new god forever not to mention the constant barrage of free gem favor and worshipper events fantastic free to play model where i never feel bad buying something live been to the hire studios in atlanta and the passion they have for this game is undeniable you cant go wrong with this game download it
daft little sim build game set in the fallout universe it uses their quirky satirical humour as you try to build a sufficient fallout shelter to save as many as you can at times i run out of money things to do as this is more of a facebook farming game than anything else but its still pretty engaging
early access review better then my in my personal opinion easy to create a world to play with your friends or alone setting restrictions on chests and similar stuff to avoid thief great performance without lags or first person shooter issues great game play land wink win very nice crafting system update one downside i have now is the premium introduced to the game which essential makes it like my paid game as a free to play user you have pretty much no control over your server settings which is very sad but other then that i still stick to my previous positives write above
rus a of the a сказать the the идеальная the a of the of the the the a of the a the a the the a a the the a the the советую the of the расслабиться a поиграть a of the eng i can not say that this is the perfect game but its cool there are tanks there and it is clear that the game is about tanks i honestly advise who wants to relax and play tanks

absolutely not worth your time i promise you the game is made so that you will be outgunned nine hundred and ten games and you roam from match to match losing all your tanks immediately the shell hast done any damage voice line will be burned into your in brain from my experience i feel as if the game is purposefully limping you with the already dice rolls this game heavily relies on luck the game is based around a battle royal system a a a ten thirteen seventeen and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down one point of battle royal which is in broken most of the time id like to see tanks around my level or one above below mine instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are one whole battle royal above you meaning your best tank is worthless if your best tank is worthless all the ones below it are useless the second i researched a tank past thirty thirty seven i immediately saw an insane rise in my battle royal battle rating versus everyone else once in a blue moon i can penetrate the tanks i find otherwise i am either getting de by enemy arm or or my own team not defending a point i went from getting five hundred and ten kills a match to getting maybe one or two sometimes zero this is not a matter of skill because i can outflank the enemy team like a in mythical norse god and still be useless because i put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank while this guys brigade of super heavy forty seven tanks turn around and all over me i cant count the number of times live seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through forty in trees arcade is in useless it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by five hundred if there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game the second your name pops up fifteen tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn heat shell with the accuracy gunner if you even attempt realistic without three thousands hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier if you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every in aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you robbing you any chance of having fun so they almost have a good game here but they wont fix the dice rolling they wont fix the matchmaking range they wont fix to make a good game i done mind the grind at all which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers they wont because it heavily incentivize people to get premium and buy their way through the grind in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their my wand it is such an incredibly frustrating and unrewarding experience once they've roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that one hundred and ten game is not worth it i rarely got matched with high battle royal until i really got into the game done even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single in stray bullet i would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging they've got going on edit tanks and aircraft are also separated in ranks these ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about one thousand seven hundred and twenty seven in battle royal although the ranges vary based on the nations you play my point being is one hundred of the tanks in france rank one are unplayable and i am not exaggerating in the slightest to compare the worst i did with a tank in rank one germany a in war thunder was something like twelve spawns and seventeen kills i never had more deaths than kills in war thunder until i tried the french the french are so bad i had a tank with seventeen spawns and two kills another tank with seventeen spawns and five kills one tank with eleven spawns and one kill the only only time i could get kills was pure and absolute luck with finishing off someone else target while i hit weak spots in the back which sometimes took many shells or shooting a notoriously terribly armoured tank by it was baffling how these tanks were incapable of penetrating even the worst of tanks non of the starting tanks would yield their sweet death to me including the japanese even when i managed to penetrate the amount of time it took me to lob fifty eight shells into a single tank only gave teammates enough time to finish them off just because you couldn't finish off their crew in sure if you google french rank one tanks you will see everyone agrees
early access review it used to be a play to win game and it was fun but then turned into a pay to win and now is just and the game is also buggy edit two february two thousand and seventeen decided to give the another shot to the game at the first match the game gave me an error that made the game freeze and then crash it took two weeks to have a reply of my ticket turns out i cant play at steam and i lost a hours premium that they done have refunded so yeah this game is not worth your time February
early access review writing this review i a knowledge that this game is still in its infantry beta phase so obviously it is a very unfinished game but with that said this game needs a lot of work even in beta the first noticeable thing are the clunky camera character controls controlling your character just feels award and the fact that you have to constantly readjust the faulty camera doesn't really help there little to no sound music fighting enemies gets boring awfully fast and the graphic style is kind of lacklustre in short this game has a long way to go you can play and give your feedback if you wish it is free after all but if i were you i would just wait for it to progress
trove is the lovechild of spiral knights min craft and wild star put together this game is truly massive it has lots of unique things to do i promise you this you'll play for one hundred hours and never get bored the possibility are truly endless with this but done take my word for it try it for yourself
for me the fact that this is a direct mobile port to personal computer int too big of an issue my only gripe with this game is that it arrived in north america censored well that and its premium pricing tactics
just started this game and i am now addicted to it it have a really nice visual and the battle elements the landscape and the way you can create party with friends is so damn fun if you are bored and you like games that are semi randy but have an role playing game element then this is the game for you so jump right in
fractured space review impressions video version tips wow youtube co watch vbpzcxikeagameplay mob overt shoulder shooter with abilities different types of ship was spectra to move mouse to aim and shoot crew tactical comes captain engineer a i navigation officer intro fractured space is first and foremost a free play game it was developed and published by edge case games and was released on september twenty second two thousand and sixteen winner of the pax west award for best mob in two thousand and sixteen fractured space is a game where you are assigned with bad ass spaceships to take over the other teams facilities and enemy base with the help of your fellow comrades and ship crew game play for starters this game is hard even while playing against an artificial intelligence the difficulty of controlling the ships is as hard as if you were controlling an actual big ship your team consists of four other ships that go against five enemy ships your crew includes a tactical a captain an artificial intelligence a comes am engineer and a navigation officer that will communicate via radio alerting you to system destruction facilities taken new enemies in sight or allies down your team must create a strategy in order to take down the enemy ships and use their re spawn time to take over the facilities in each location to follow until you can get access to the enemy base and win the game while needing to pay attention to the enemy ships that spawn you also need to control your facilities capture new ones beware ships that are shooting you take cover and make sure you re not destroying the ship by hitting meteorites on your way phew seems like a lot to do just in one go just wait till you see the mini maps there are five locations in each round these being the home base beta one and two alpha one and two gamma and enemy base on the minimal you can see how many facilities are in each location how many are under your teams control how many under the enemy a and how many teammates are there as well as the number of enemy ships battleships there are different kinds of ship such as attack defense and utility even though you can relate to most mob that these types are the usual distant healer system each ship has their own way of handling shooting and game play attack ships are as expected specialised in ship destruction but they can go from sniper to bruiser ships defensive are the ones that hold the front line and have their own squadron of fighters to help them some even have repair drones that surround them during the combat making them tougher to deal with and utility are ships that focus on supporting their comrades not just by healing but with abilities that buffs and clean rebuffs their speed and attack effectiveness also change depending on your ship of choice and abilities vary according to the ship you choose you can give the ships a try and see how each of the abilities work i strongly recommend trying them because on the firing range there are tips of how to play correctly with each ship presentation the ships design looks great specially with the various skins for each their texture and color palette turned out really good and you can appreciate them from each side and detail shown in the ships the scenery is amazing some locations seem to have been taken from a sci i film production though it does to seem to vary that much i felt specially satisfied with the jump sequence since it has been well planned for the game and reminded me of the millennium falcon hyper drive or the enterprise warp jumps the games sound effects are flawless and well explored though the voice acting for the crew seems a bit too robotic and a quite stereotyped the epic soundtrack brings you the feeling of being in a real sci i space war conclusion considering that i played this game for nearly five hours and i plan to play more of it in the near future the amount of twenty five dollars worth five hours were definitely worth the hours spent playing for free seeing the final product its easy to notice that a lot of time and effort have been invested in this production since its a free game our real question here is whether it is or int worth wasting your time to play it well i be played this game for four hours and was getting as excited as a child to see my ranks and stats going up i got impressed with its visual art and game play even if it was a bit hard at the beginning you may get a bit bored from some repetitions in scenery sometimes it may be just a bunch of asteroids on the way and that a it and your crews orders and reports it is a fun game to play with friends though teamwork is important here in order to create a strategy and make sure someone don to just pop into a location and gets killed because they were alone well being the overall it is a very fun and beautiful game that you can enjoy playing nonstop for hours its cost for the buyers is lower that the cost of production and even if they wanted to establish a price of say twenty dollars for the game it would be worth it since its free i don to see a single reason why you should to spend the next five hours having an amazing time with this game what are you waiting for go download it live long and prosper a all reviewed by al atari september
what it used to bethe entire system is designed to entice you into paying for something so naturally balanced and engaging game play is of no concern to the developers do not waste your time or currency on this if you are looking for a proper game
early access review ugh another one of these if you like battle royal well here is more of the same this is more of a cartoon style game with a class system no base building like footnote power up before taking on your enemies
amigo just bought trio and now they are gonna do what they know best milk it until it die the game itself was a fantastic idea it didst deserve those companies running it also it went downhill since the gem boxes update rip trove
early access review pots and pans for arm or world war ii occupied france as a setting with german soviet and american weapons dank food for heals booster items that will make you giggle like the kneepad of speed or the bunny slippers of bounce the engine is super well optimized for a game that started out as a joke makes some other game look like a complete joke itself when you look at it game play feels amazing and killing other cuisines feels super rewarding the player count per match might be lacking but that can be fixed over time i hope they add routine as heals too sometime in other words this game is awesome some might not like it but i sure damn do kitchen warfare at its finest one thousand and ten
if you like capital ship combat arenas like dreadnought or even the idea of piloting spaceships in general then you will like this game the combat is great with many ships to choose from whether you like to be the big and slow leviathan or the small and nimble hunter the daily reward system does not punish you for taking a break from the game there is a surprising but somewhat shallow level of customization there are quite a few game modes to choose from and the option to play either player versus player or is artificial intelligence there are quests that encourage you to break out of your shell and try ships you may not normally play there is a satisfying grind to the game though it can get a bit shallow once you unlock the one ship you only play as the only issue i have had is frequent crashes but i play on a laptop and there is the ability to reconnect to matches you have lost connection to overall this game is a great example of a ship is ship game and i highly recommend it to anyone seeking a new free to play game to play may
in deeply wondering how the hell this game with so many bugs issues gets a very positive reviews even just from registration and the fax email support from the perfect what the hell world is really frustrating a note for game master you better delete it if you didst want to fix those bugs you bug
early access review even tho the game is in alpha much smoother than competitors and much more fun no build system and feels a lot better still a little unbalanced but hey its an alpha enjoyed every second so far
this game is pretty fun a lot of the reviews say you need to pay to do anything but that not the case you can get the things you pay for through quests wasteland quests little quests found while exploring and objectives i get on the game usually once per day to collect resources level people and skills up send people on quests and into the wasteland and collect supplies from people returning i usually turn on this game and collect things while i read there is a bit of waiting with training and people going to explore and get to quest objectives but its a nice thing to keep up in the background while reading
i really like this game its a refreshing change to clicker heroes there are many classes that actually specialize in certain things and give you the ability to create a load out of heroes to properly deal with any situation you come across the quests for each level are straightforward and the objectives help you gain gems the in game currency pretty quickly for any clicker veterans in the end this is a great free play and id definitely suggest it to anyone looking for a new clicker experience
early access review best battle royal out there in played pub footnote and son i was even playing roe when it was only available in thailand the map is amazing and the variety of transport is great car snowboard glider gonzalez and ski mobile the weapons are great and has an awesome variety the game mechanics work great and are super smooth you don not need to buy the game pass to win but its there id you want it this is a true free game with some micro transactions but you done need to buy them to win in addicted to this game and so are my friends its great fun playing solo or as a squad
these are one of first games i played on my gaming personal computer and it worked just fine but then it updated a lot sense i lasted played and now it lags like crazy if you have good internet this is the game for you
the game is very fun and a good time waster although its becoming more like its bigger brother in other words its evolving into a pay to win game or should i say devolving its quite obvious that war gaming wants your money nearly all game developers wants money but it shouldn't be this extreme i know its not that extreme but as of the looks of it it will become very extreme indeed the game also needs a lot and i mean a lot of work on the matchmaking the tiers are very good indeed but when it comes to tank types it needs heavy work its not fun coming in a game with only lights on your team and the enemy is only heavy and ads for example as of right now the game is recommendable at a debatable level but if it keeps becoming more pay to win ill unfortunately not recommend it done go the british heavy line laugh out loud
early access review even though this game is just in alpha early access the game has been very well maintained and very fun to play if this was the work of video kohima id give it a one thousand and ten
els word review the game overall is perfect the controls to the game play i have been a player of els word since its early days of re easement way before it was even considered a steam release i have been playing for all well over a few years of this game and i can say a lot has changed through out the updates like how chung as added to the game and it center all that goodness overall great game just that i stopped playing for various problems like my premium items that i bought for unlimited time like no seven days stuff is all gone so i got and bored at the game but other than that little complaint the game its self is great
it is a pay to win game uneven match making putting tanks that have no uses on teams that cant hurt the other side where machine guns kill you faster than and seventy five pm shell it is a money sink cant sell you old tanks trying to force to too buy new slots
early access review this game has a lot of potential but since it is in early access it still has a long way to go personally i found some of the dialogue to be pretty funny the thing i done like right now is the lack of items in shops compared to adventure quest worlds
quick pros and con pros its nostalgic its extremely fun at the start louis free it kills free time cons you can pay to get everything faster it gets repetitive and boring if you done pay if you buy something and delete the save file a wasted your money no skill involved
i done know where to start this is the first time i feel the need to write a review i spent thirty minutes reading reviews on forums and here in steam eight thousand and ninety negative and that coming from players with two thousand to a hours spent on the game about the last patch and as someone who has played this game since data one live seen a lot of changes some were good and some of course not but you could've get along with them and even start to like them however this last update seven hundred is not like them it completely changes everything to add so much new things in one time its so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero is different now the supports are carries and the carries supports its like i have no knowledge of the game about the visuals the new had is really small keep in mind many people play on standard laptops size one hundred and fifty six and the health bar is hard to watch when its on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar it will really be good if after all the changes you get the option to adjust all of those for example to expand the had like the map size i would like as many others the new update to be a new game like data three so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch six hundred and eighty eight we all like but i know this wont happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional players done say something if the idea of this update was to draw more people to the game keep in mind is it worth it and will they be more than the one leaving it i personally wont be playing it unless some drastic changes take place which most likely wont happen
early access review the game is good but the crafting system is awful you have to wait a long time to be able to get the item you crafted even at low level what the hell and this game is nothing compare to adventure quest worlds
this game cannot run with my log tech controllers plugged in neither of them can be plugged into my computer or they will completely override the games controls the screen will always move to the right no matter what if either controller is plugged in log tech extreme pro joystick and log tech dual action game controller nothing is being pressed down on either one not one button is being used i have disabled both of them in windows yet your piece of game still thinks they are moving the screen around and the buttons for a by a on the game are flashing rapidly as if someone is pushing all the buttons and holding them down again not one freaking button is being pushed and i am not about to go behind my desk and unplug two good controllers because your piece of game cant figure it out deal with this now
never been ban from any game nor have i cheated hacked in any game my account however got hacked into and the person who did proceeded to hack and cheat getting my account banned when i contacted hire for support they did nothing and left my account banned
if you are looking for a world war two flight simulator this definitely its not your game of course have good graphics and some physics but its all seems more a call of duty with plane skin and you'll see planes with doubtful flight model weapons not working realistically because of hit detection problems and other issues multiplayer missions and map designs forcing players and planes to act weird different than an aerial combat of world war two high altitude bombers flying low strafing ground targets interceptors attacking ground targets ground attackers joining in dogfights bombers joining in dogfights bomber hunters afraid to attack bombers planes of the same team attacking each other in rarest times you can see any cooperation as aerial squadrons and so on and done get surprised if your prop plane of the world war two got in a match against a jet of korean war era its pretty normal there well they said game still in beta phase so they need fix and implement a lot of things yet if you want give a try be my guest
i play it on first mobile hand i play it this on notebook now i play it this on steam hit is a really addictive stuff be careful i have spoken this to good to be real for free for the bug if you lose your save you need to sign in one another personal computer and that download the cloud saving for me that working if i have that save issues bug meet pleasure
so heres me a big kid basically hung over one day and this game this game made everything so much worse unresponsive saggy and just a quick knock up of what could have been a really cool game
early access review when i played this game last summer it was very fun and enjoyable and i done remember it being much of a grind it was a complete blast to play with friends but unfortunately i can not say the same now this game like almost every free to play title has now decided to go down the pay two win route if you want to get a gun it will probably take you hours upon hours just to unlock it that is unless you want to pay real money of course it is a damn shame because this game had a lot of potential for a free to play game but unfortunately falls flat on its face due to its heavy shift towards pay two win
early access review played this game since set one drafting is fun and balancing the ladder games are not too tedious and in general it is a game i play on and off pretty much every week and still enjoy so for what that worth i think it is a very solid game
do you like card games do you like the elder scroll universe well this game is going to be a blast for you its free to play and in my opinion pretty rewarding even when you done pay anything i feel that i am still doing well in player versus player even though i haven spent any money which is a big plus for me should you play this game i would say yes i been playing it every day before i go to work just a couple of games and its still for fun for me off course like i said in the beginning you need to like card games for this being a title you should pick up i made a longer review on youtube which you can find here tips youth beta you
i love this game its so much fun three monster and three spell rap card zones done even bother me i done have much play time on steam because i always played it on my phone good port
updated dec two thousand and eighteen fun free game with appealing graphics but kind of pointless after a while updated for dec twenty sixteen patch the deus ruined the game imagine you were a shop keeper in the soviet union sounds fun huh not price controls were implemented to prevent people from being too successful and having fun why on earth would they do that
not going to lie this game is pretty fun why a negative review you ask because of how unbalanced this game is i am following someone for so long putting thousands of shots into them some plane comes out of no where and puts two twenty round bursts into him and he dies guess who should get the kill after three critical the guy that comes out of no where and puts two bursts into him for some reason in fighting people in tier two with is and yaks and i have two planes that are the last one in tier one also this game has a major russian bias i play realistic and every time my squad gets instantly one shot by yaks and there is nothing we can do about it eventually i got tired of the bias and said if we cant beat pm join pm so i got the first yak you can get and in amazed most countries done get cannons till the middle of tier two but hey the first russian plane you can research has a twenty my cannon i took it into an arcade match and i could shoot three bursts and the plane would literally tear into prices do not play this game
so good very not free to play you have to buy zen in order to do anything or get anywhere in the game cant take professions without purchasing profession packs and or keys for the life boxes in addition to the free to play not is the constant constant crashing of the game client or the severe lag suffered if you can miraculously stay connected at all i really like the game quests and world too bad it is not maintained and expensive to play
bad reviews are based on the fact it is not entirely free to play and for this game the money is worth the membership this is a hunting simulation the best hunting simulation out there might i add with a large variety of animals to hunt many very detailed hunting reserves with stationary hunting towers pretty well full customised load outs for your hunting trips a massive arsenal of weapons handguns bows shotguns rifles and even muzzle loaders in black powder you cant go wrong if you are into these games this is the best one of so these people made the game put their time and money into it and a very well made game with amazing graphics and realism whats wrong with paying a few dollars considering the base program is free so many people do not even understand the concept of this and that explains the bad review i have played this game for over three years now on the non steam client and i will continue to play
early access review this is straight up ball sack i do not recommend wasting your twenty minutes downloading this sack of you have to literally pay like twenty bucks cash for the basic coins package because its in pesos or euros or some stupid whf blizzard
""
well mini update i done play this anymore for the time being i stopped liking grind mechanism but my point on the review stands still recommend it lets list some things free to play with some premium content as expected at least they give you the opportunity to earn some currency with ship these items missions sometimes the premium content is deceitful when you lack one resource the refill button inside the craft menu is for refilling only the necessary mats to craft it not the full storage good artwork and slight animations music needs improvement lot of content collection st can rejoice here actually cooperative no player versus player the small player versus player factor is only there to help your city grow without harming the enemy city timers yes long timers at higher levels but they advance while offline so you can log in a few times on the day while doing other things girl this feature for some players may be a chore May
an amazing flight sim not for the casual gamer i would suggest but for players who want to spend all the money into getting a top notch flight sim and like some other top flight sims out there some body looking to spend the money time effort into learning how to fly weather it it is recreational flying bush planes or working your way up to flying for an airline i myself am a real world pilot and been flying bush planes for twenty plus years now and i am always on the look for a top notch flying sim to keep logging hours in different type of situations i might find myself in my own plane getting into and being prepared for the worst case scenario possible and to not panic when i have cargo or customers on board that are relying on me to get them to there destinations and back safely and also enjoy sitting back in my flight seat and picking all sorts of air planes from a twin otter to a seven hundred and forty even and flying from a point of interest maybe half way around the world to another place or airport that seems interesting if you are a serious flight simmer i would recommend this to all and the great add on it has to offer plus the many other top notch flight sims out there so sit back and enjoy the thrill
early access review this game is a extremely good game if you enjoy grinding even though it is in beta still it has good graphics and gives players a lot of fun when they do play
early access review could easily write a page essay on all the issues bless currently has item duplication exploit that has been present and known ever since korean release terrible optimization as soon as there is more than five players on screen the first person shooter goes down to seven or powerful top end systems game having a large emphasise on player versus player having such low first person shooter is unacceptable buggy quests bad translation and voice acting missing content these are the most game breaking issues there is many more issues but in so fed up with the game that i cant even be bothered ranting about them
early access review honestly only played one game but its pretty damn fun and smooth a great free two play battle royal game that still in early access but install it and see if you like it
early access review started playing this a few days ago as a new player i have observed that a lot of matches are one sided stomp fests if you done spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match a waste of time unless you re willing to drop cash to roll for epic legendary items before ever setting foot in a match edit after putting more hours into the game i find the game play to be flawed every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind so long range weaponry is useless on most maps this compounds the problem with the game i mentioned earlier not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed but you need specifically short ranged ones it is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps
a proper magic clone with a good card economy the ability to play on personal computer phone and tablet really makes it great free initial campaign nets you several cards to get started with and there are multiple modes of play against artificial intelligence and other players only drawback is one versus one only but for a free game with several mechanics multiple expansions a fair in game market paid options consistent connectivity and events cant complain too much
was fun learning the game but over all got boring fast for me most of the real time based games are limited early on by slots and or hero you can pay to unlock more slots for quests and crafting items but you can unlock them with gold at different levels i got to level ten before removing the game i am sure if you pay for slots you can progress much quicker but by that time you will be really bored anyways of this game i installed the game again and got into an active clan it seems there is much more to the game only thing that really bothers me is i find that when i send heroes onto quests arm or with a thirty chance to breaks does so very often
when i first started playing ever quest two it was amazing its still great the players were friendly and mature there were lots of things to do still is but now days groups are tough to come by because of the population decline about a year ago update six hundred and twenty two thousand and eighteen population problems seem to have been evened out due to server merges the shadow oddest was the prime of ever quest two limo i suggest playing this many people have made life long friends and even gotten married girl because of this game i still have so many great memories from people i played this with but bridges have been burned and i cant relive them so i have to make new ones its so sad for me to see so many people i used to play with leave for other mos and never return the best time of my gaming life was when i was playing my main at the time on the ever frost server merged with another server so it int call that anymore in a guild called storm surge this is a game where you have to be respectful of other players because there a rent millions of people login on every day like of or so you unknowingly begin making a name for yourself when you begin playing get this game maybe you can have great memories like i do ever quest is an massively multiplayer online role playing game unlike any other unrivalled in its content update six hundred and twenty two thousand and eighteen i have been playing seq for ten years the only reason steam says i have less than three hundred hours is because it hast been on steam for the full duration of its release so if i had to guess id say i have around three thousands four thousands hours on ever quest my main is called scuttlebutt and he is on the antonia bayle server hit me up if you want to play
three hundred and thirty hours on here but i think around one thousand more on glyph progressively makes yourself wanna neck the more time you put in but once you get to what you think is the light at the end of the tunnel its pretty chill there a quite a hefty lock that holds the pay to win of the game and you can force through it but the game does a really good job of making it seem worth it which most of it int i done really know whether to say i recommend or done recommend it but i think for the minuscule size and free to play you have nothing to lose if you like it that good if you done done force yourself because it will be a horrible time
maybe this just int my style of game but i didst find it engaging enough after five minutes to want to continue in not keen on games in which everything is done for you just select what you want place it wait for resources repeat no challenge the waiting thing is a no no for me as a gamer there needs to be more engaging activities than pushing pixels around on a whim
steam claims twenty three hours but i have far exceeded that number before the game came to steam i love this game it gets very grind at times but honestly i done mind it its a nice game to just blow some stuff up the only con that i can see if it bothers you is the grind
this int really a review of the game as a whole but rather of its state right now this game used to be in a very bad place realm was neglected by its owner kab am which allowed hackers and exploiters to do whatever the hell they wanted with the game realm was very slowly dying and many well known players within the community were leaving and overall the whole experience of playing this game became a lot less fun luckily for us kab am has recently sold our beloved game to people who actually give a about it dec games in the past month or so dec games has done so much to improve the game and restore it back to its former glory right now is the best time you've ever had to start playing realm i recommend anyone to give this game a chance again if you already have in the past and if you re new you should one hundred give it a try
taking into account we already have better mos like term or wow i done think you could witness something new in never winter i do not know anything about the do lore so maybe you could give it a shot if you do but personally i think there are better games of the genre
great graphics great game get it so you can play with me i demand it simple put you fly around your plane and shoot or bomb ground targets tons of planes to choose from a you lvi up and get better planes money int needed to play although in sure it just give you the nicer stuff sooner in fine with waiting
well i was once like you a person with a life scrolling through steam until i saw this so called innocent game i downloaded it and begin to play now i cant stop and i refuse to leave my personal computer i highly recommend it
i wish i could recommend i wish i could like this game i racked up over twenty four hours of play time in four days of trying the game this game is hands down the most frustrating and tear provoking game that invokes levels of nerd rage i did not know possible why is that in glad you asked this game has the depth and potential to be great however as it stands the mechanics are god awfully skewed in a way i did not for see est has less ring spam as hearthstone which should make it a better game right wrong the impact ring has on this game in a single play can decide an entire match based off one lucky ring roll the ring mechanics of this game impact very high value moves the rune system means if you get all five of your runes pope and no prophecy and your opponent pops two of his and both are prophecies you are done you will likely not over come two free often powerful card plays in the most critical of needs ring will fail you absolutely and unapologetic ally leaving you to go one thousand and fifteen game losing streaks intellect storage tactics and brilliant deck building means nothing in the end all that matters is luck the only silver lining is that the win fest that is hearthstone is less applicable as even a dec of thirty legend aries can and will still get screwed by bad ring rolls one pro was the story mode it was fun and interesting however over all this game falls flat on its competitive play being decided for you you done decide anything the draw decides everything i once went eight games in a row where i would get stuck with a nine cost legendary in my first draw or initial hand in some way i had seventy cards in that deck and yet one out of seventy chances out of eight games i got stuck with a useless card that caused me to lose is opponents who always have the right cost cards for opening play there is nothing more infuriating then knowing you are losing to people not because of skill or tactics simply because the game decided it didst want you to win that is not a fun game
without paying you basically have a dec demo or an extreme grind this game could be great if it took a leaf out of the book on fishing planet and have us a daily play bonus that ended on the fifth day with some premium currency that coupled with maybe adds for the guest players when starting up would certainly be tolerable either give us an option to pay thirty fifty all in for infinite play offline without using the servers or multiplayer and have it run as a single player game maybe backing up save data to the steam cloud like many games do then the subscriptions just add boosters or access to cosmetically better kit
simple enough that you can hop in join the fray and have loads of fun fighting not a hard core flight sim no need to tweak throttles knobs switches just jump in and go if you are looking for absolute one hundred realism then this is not the game for you if you are looking for one hundred fun you found it plus free makes any game fun i use a thrust master flight stick without issues it even has it on the list of supported peripherals check six
early access review no balance on player versus player nerved players damage to one third but no change on monsters he whatever in dungeon or outside the game is so slow and you always stuck on your next main request because your level did not reach it then you have to use your low damage to kill high he monster and level up first person shooter is always under three hundred and two thousand and eighteen game
this class based shooter might seem cartoony and corny at first but once you start playing its a hell of lot of fun also there tons of cool weapons and cosmetics to dress up with and try out i have always enjoyed playing this game
game has a solid base but it is totally pay two win which is fine i have paid real money on this game but end of the day it is only ever a temporary boost no matter how much money you give the game demands more tryst to progress is like trying to run on a treadmill that is in a pool full of jelly if you play for the fun of the game only it is great the moment you start to want to progress be prepared to pay cause after you hit a certain tier the maintenance cost of keeping your planes flying outweighs the rewards you get from playing so while there technically in a limit on what you can get for free there really is it int even a time issue it is case of diminishing returns that screws you over to or short bursts good trying to compete bad it is not a money issue i have close on one thousands games in my steam account alone if i think a game is worth i have no problem spending money just this game you have to spend serious money constantly unless you are happy to use the lowest tiers
eng this is game rarely its just will be better if you wont play with this game parry passive dash cancer cancer cancer all the players always do it normal players they a rent there everybody want to win therefore they play likes cancers be to the developers themselves spoiled this game re редкостное of the of играйте a the of возможно the a a the a the the the the a of разрабы наконец the the the the the of of the of of the советую удалить the of a попробовать of the the the the the the a the the состояние the the the the the a the the the the the the the пидарству the a the the a of the the the a the the разрыбы the the of the the the the a практически the the a of the of ten положительных the up site the the the of the of the a of the the the the the a of the of the the a of the the the of
early access review honestly this game feels like steep as battle royal game cd i personally really like the snow setting and the class system is a really good idea that feels new and fresh the gunplay needs a little work balancing but so far id say its worth a play
in the army you had to disassemble your a under thirty seconds with your eyes closed this game lets you do the same without the time limit and the fear of having to peel potatoes if you fail
very fun unique take on a role playing game basically where games like diabolo and torchlight have you level up skills through a skill tree and add stats through gemsbok tables path of exile does the opposite you add stats through a huge stat tree and add skills to your class through socket able items really cool great atmosphere and lots of replay potential did i mention its free
balance the game do not make it to historical how the hell do two us a mae sherman easy eight shooting at one again at only one german panzer a aus a at the same time what was the out come the two us a tanks get destroyed whf the german tank took its time to select which target to history first while being shot at multiple times this is my first review ever on steam this game was fun but now you just die of head shots all the time when i mean all the time you die head shot after continuous after consecutive head shots you may think of maybe there is a hacker using aim bot but no how wrong are you to think that its the game everyone cannot be a hacker with aim bot no its the game you will die all the time with head shots everyone is a pro no scope head shot death dealer but you playing they need to update this issue the game play sucks when you die all the time with one shot head shot may
early access review for the most part i have had a desert experience with rob craft although it is considered a free game it is impossible to play without premium in order to receive more items to allow you to compete with other players you must have premium i would consider this game pay to win
i have been playing this for many months on my smartphone i heard that it had been ported to steam and wanted to be able to play it using my steam account once i provided the correct information the deus linked my account inside of five minutes i was blown away at how fast and efficient they were thank you guys for making a good casual game thank you for fast and responsive support well done
data two is the most popular multiplayer online battle arena mob game in the world if you ever heard league of legends or heroes or newest they are the copies of the original data which was a mod for war craft iii game data two is amazingly improved compared to data one in the matter of design and mechanism in case you have no idea what is a mob game each game consists of two teams the radiant and the dire each team has their main building called the ancient melee barracks ranged barracks towers and some small buildings that has no use the main goal is to destroy the enemy ancient each player are given control of one of your chosen her which has their own roles and skills the map is divided into three lanes which are separated by jungles filled with neutral monsters that you can kill for gold you need to level up your hero along the game and buy him her items from the shop you need gold to buy the items that will upgrade your hero damage movement speedup regents you'll get the gold from killing no controllable ais called creeps that will spawn on every lane neutral creep destroying enemy structures or killing enemy heroes pros amazing graphics and animations for a mob game requires a long time to learn this game non payt will items are cosmetics only requires full teamwork and communication extremely challenging game play hard master heroes millions of players online everyday bots available for private practice match do this before going into real player versus player to avoid being bullied cons too many serious players since the prize of the tournaments are really big mini update almost everyday this is a problem for people with slow internet connection no more free cosmetic items from games unless you pay for tickets to predict who will win the game tons of speaker players especially filipinos in sorry not racist its a fact that from my three hundred and fifty hours of game layabout ninety five of filipinos i met are extremely childish and have no manners please olson think i done know what does angina bob pot means southeast asia region community tons of people with slow internet connection still persist to play the game which will ruin the whole team with their lag if you done have decent stable internet connection do not play data tons of people with insufficient personal computer spec but still persist to play dot which will cancel a lot of match because of their endlessly anytime or destroys the whole team with their first person shooter lag please read the minimum spec requirements very expensive cosmetics ballot two is a game that used for professional gaming sports and most of them never see data two as a game they see it as a goldmine to make a living do not be surprised with the amount of serious players you'll meet the game play is quite challenging and difficult to learn like counter strike got his game is not made for casual fun but its free there nothing wrong to download and try this game if you have stable internet connection and acceptable personal computer spec
early access reviewing played this game for the past three or four builds the deus ruined it by making the grind unbearable i done mind grinding i actually think that grinding makes some games bearable for example my character haas been at the same rank ever since i was ninety hours into the game another thing live been losing money just for using a weapon the way it was designed to be used that is a problem
early access review played this game a couple of weeks i loved this game when i reach rank five i had only ppd forty with one bullet upgrade when i start playing on airport map i understand that the enemy team have recon with the last sniper with full upgrades he kill me from very far distance i think this is a great game with great design but when you reach rank five you play on very big and incomprehensible maps and you will play against rank five six seven twenty with full upgrade weapons vehicles and planes re tomato please fix this cool game
after hours and hours of being spawn camped sniped and wall banged by hackers i made a steady foothold on this game i was given some items by one of the less toxic members of the infestation community and i must say this is shaping out to be pretty good still too many in hackers and snipers that spawn camp of out of you mag anti cheat is not spicy enough
i love the game while i done got many hours on personal computer i have played for what i think is over six hundred hours on console this game is amazing games now are dedicated to money and providing little content this game just in blows my mind with the levels of intensity of these battles i would love to see this game be token by a big company and revived this game int shown the love that it used to install this game and done stop playing it in endless game play
early access review this game is the worst best game that i have ever played pro free to play counter strike with cod features not pay to win most items are cosmetic good way to grind time with friends cons awful hit realisation weird bugs sex getting close to a player will launch you in the air or die game played multiplayer conclusion it is a mixture of cod and counter strike with awful game play and bugs a deformed baby of both parents
old good game if a bit unfinished balanced and grind province graphics smooth on poor internet great early experience cons types of currency after tier three of five you will have to pay money if you want to see any real progress the meta can feel hopeless dreadnoughts can rotate damage negation with shields with even one healer they literally cannot die two dreadnoughts two healers makes an impenetrable wall nukes cannot even break it after the early game all the ships become largely the same recommendations single player or group is for example corvette racing boss battles wave survival missions etc reduce dreadnought damage negation time to prevent invincibility increase corvette damage or reduce tactical cruiser health to balance support increase plasma ram width by a tiny bit implement another weapon that negates shields besides rams
with seventy this is not to data we loved anymore i have been playing since war craft iii data and really loved it data two was enjoyable due to similarities of original data the new update totally took that away from us seventy changed major things that differentiated defense of the ancients two from league of legends and heart of storm the game pace became so fast that it feels you are playing league of legends valve if i wanted to play league of legends i would have played league of legends not to mention the indecipherable user interface what is this maybe i should go back to war craft data
early access review so far i have managed to accumulate fifty minuets in this game not playing mind you trying to log in this is no fault of the game developers in just an idiot and typed my email with pm instead of com when trying to register and didst realise so all in all like skim two with game play
early access review best battle royal game live played so far finally a fresh take on the game mode i like very much brings me so too much fun and its very well optimized no major bugs no annoying mechanics just simple and fun game and its free
early access review exceeded all my expectations there are a few small issues with the game not great optimisation tabbing out takes about fifteen seconds not great driving mechanics it center but its in early access and with seemingly good deus i believe this game could go far it takes a new spin on battle royal games which i personally love
i legitimately got scared for a few parts for such a simplistic game it has achieved more than your average a a scare game will but graphics matter go shoots yourself or rather go play this game i have to say for a free game this thing delivers quite a lot i love the references i have found in the game so far and the easter eggs a the deeper you delve the more this becomes a master piece going from arcade to the common overly used failed experiment horror tags to some anime with major plot twists mad oka to tortured souls to more references that i yet have to encounter edit nominated for haunting my dreams
this is a very fun game you can play with your friends its coop its multiplayer its free to play action role playing game indie massively multiplayer you should play this game its also free
early access review cant even tell exactly i am hyped for this game after playing it out for a bit i experienced the amazing graphics the mechanics and overall fast paced combat the only thing i can ever state out as a negative trait is the size of the maps they are mainly made for very quick paced close quarters combat they are really small but have a lot of pathways inside them that kinda dissipates the small size of the maps i really hope developers continue with this system and do not create a pay to win game in future currently even in this state it is a mind blowing and very addictive game i am actually considering to move to this game from counter strike go very toxic community with insane amount of bugs the mechanics are quite similar too you have acc relation based movement unlike in games like over watch all of this i rate one thousand and ten
early access review the game was better on day one compared to now they've dumped it down too much with their reduction in damage and increase in health they cant balance weapons for just look at the sword hire lowers the skill gap patch by patch and the player count viewer count fun amount is also lowered patch by patch
small review from a newbie pretty alright game and ill get to my little review on it starting with the cons cons main issues the horrible optimization of the servers including how its pretty difficult to get through the early stages by playing freely simply put its a game where they'll probably try to milk you for all you have unless you get very lucky with the riga couple bugs here and there all being somewhat annoying but not the worst thing out there pros community pretty funny at times fun map to explore but it can be tedious to travel around so much not even being able to teleport back to your cornerstone this ones a con and a pro depends on how you like to play freely building on in your cornerstone is a nice feature along with the items you can later get to upgrade the appearance of it lots of freedom to build whatever you like in all honesty feel free to give it a try id recommend it
early access review valhalla is a fine game it has a small handful of issues but most of them are pretty minor and not worth mentioning the only one that i feel like actually talking about is how similar the characters are one character with a gun weapon feels almost identical to another character with a gun weapon however this issue int really to big anymore since they've been adding more unique moves to each character if you want a good two dimensional brawler i would highly recommend this game
this game is very addictive i have been playing for more than two months and i love it it looks simple but very repetitive and it makes you want to win more and more how could anyone not like this game although its not a first person shooter or so lots of people who are into a style of game play like this would love it check it out i dare you to get one thousand medallions in the first week
no matter how big the tank an a a gun will always beat you out you are a medium tank sneaking up on at a a boy sure sucks to be you as soon as that a a realizes you re there and will he you only have a matter of seconds to shoot his truck and hope it doesn't ricochet before he shoots through your twenty my arm or like its your grandmas kidneys thinking of using an antitank gun tank bah done sweat it you'll only ricochet half the time that only if an enemy tank with only a barrel sticking out doesn't tag you and bag you first
bad game you have to pay just to play the game and disassemble a gun or whatever you are disassemble i would not recommend it if there was more to it and maybe a range and stuff as well as not having to pay to play it then it would be a bit better
it would be by far the best mob in terms of play style and such things but the servers are way to saggy there are way to much bugger around hire refuses to fix and the skill description often hides way to much deciles making it nearly impossible to take the game serious at a higher competitive game play
early access review my first review about this game was positive because i was mainly playing the single player mode after a few hours that was not enough anymore then i started to play team deathwatch and battle arena at to there no reason to play serious even if you get top score if you die you'll receive the same bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match after do some damage to an enemy only there no teamwork because only the top score alive at the end of the match will receive the plutonium box so is just a race for kills and points if by any chance you finish the match alive but you did no damage to an enemy you'll not receive any box zero score zero box even on the winning team a has usually better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast my main complain about this game is there no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and five cubes as base just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design
early access review tried giving it a shot i really enjoyed the artificial intelligence games the forge and the gauntlet but then i spent about two hours trying ranked games and its just a game of who has legend aries and who koestler entries are far too strong and prevalent in the she ranks where new players go so its not even playable for someone with basic edit as an update even the single player mode int fun anymore when you get far enough you'll start facing enemy decks loaded with stun stun is the most disgustingly a fun and in interactive she i have ever seen it takes the horrible freeze mechanic from hearthstone that literally everybody hates and multiplies it by two literally when someone casts stun on your minion from any of the various sources you cannot block with it that turn then you cant attack the following turn and you cant block the following turn after that with how quick games are decided stun is effectively killing a unit and yet its cheap or free in all cases because of stun i will no longer be playing this game
early access review this game is constantly evolving some addition good some bad there are a lot of people who done like it and i get it live got three hundred and fifty hours in the game and when i ever have a large streak of kills i could understand the anger from my victims two years ago the game was not like this literary everyone was at the same level so grinding was a piece of cake as time passed more and more people got better weapons and that was that then a surge of people joined and once they reached level five they were put into games with experience players such as i all with one shot rifles up to an insane range guilty as charged and it does not stop at the rifles even pistols can be upgraded to be a three shot kill at a also guilty as charged so anyone who says the game is pay to win is partial right but it was not always that way i had my friends play with me and they were very angry at how the starting weapons are absolute garbage and that they were dying too easily the game has so much potential but it is really only fun for people who have played for long enough old the game is at this point a pay to win still fun to play though
early access review one of the best first person shooter shooters of all time at first i was confused because i was referred to this game by my close friend when he tells me about the mechanics i was instant veteran this game has good graphics and it has a similar feel to counter strike global offensive and call of duty this game is great if you have the graphic settings set to the high preset keep it up game developers i host servers and i would like to host a server for this game because this game is the best
early access review raw system is rigged as ten mana in a row for either player happens every game drawing same card three times in a row it center having to draw mana is in trash in magic why would they not go the hearthstone route and make it fun to play instead of a rigged draw shuffle system small plus is you can grind on artificial intelligence for cards unlike is paying for cards is actually more expensive than is and for a worse game that ripoffs magic there no reason to play it and artificial intelligence cheats is dumb so yeah
team fortress two used to be my favourite game but the july eighth update ruined everything for almost everyone and if they done revert the changes or at least make casual games actually casual then ill cash out sell my four hundred worth of in game items and never look back valve needs to remember why team fortress two is different than counterstrike and over watch and not having the ability to goof around in a truly relaxed environment destroys fun for ninety of the player base July
early access review from hero to zero when the game came out it was really good but as now after all the bad patches they fund up whole game its really sad but we cant do anything about it i had fun but everything has to end one day
early access review feel like to make some comment for this game after bought twenty five plutonium crates and gained seven epic parts with no legend aries why should i spend my money on these plutonium crates if no finer parts they give than rusted done buy this game epic loot epic disappointment
a great free play experience for anyone as lonely as me until you level up so much that the hat anim women die before you get a chance to map to them a all though the game has no plot or context the appearance of the are more than enough of a selling point for me which is saying something since the game is free my nan also recommended it
absolutely terrible i tried playing this game about ten times in virtual reality nine out of those it crashed the last try it started but the game would freeze every five seconds making it unplayable absolutely the worst racing experience i have ever had
early access review liked it in spite of being in alpha mode its pretty good a player like me coming from data two and first person shooter might have bit problems in understanding the mechanism but you guys will get used to it enjoy
was a good game at one point it is mostly now a cash grab by the money hungry deus if you want to play the game as a free to play it will take a very long time to unlock anything past tier two and three hundred and forty five are impossible to unlock in a reasonable amount of time with ought dropping money into it now lets not forget the damage models of these planes if you so much as breath on the wings they will break off the control of the aircraft in arcade and realistic are poor infuriating at times ground forces are beyond broken ships done seem that bad but it feels to little and to late in my opinion so if you are looking for a realistic and well developed combat flight go to in if you wanna goof of and around for a couple hours and done care much about progression its probably for you
early access review if you play using der or var in kit doesn't look all that bad the game feels super call of duty is with counter strike elements if you re somewhat decent at cod my you re going to crush everyone in this game check my screenshots the game is not pay to win the micro transactions are all cosmetic right now there int much content i can see this game being somewhat fun to play for an hour its my just go ahead and try it
even though this game is simple and decent fun its pretty dull and repetitive once you play it for a while there are micro transactions of some level which is pretty much inevitable in today free to play titles at least its free and you can play it a fairly decent amount without investing any money in it
early access review this game is just getting on your nerves in fodders invincibility when re spawned and they can kill you this game is just ebola this game sucks so bad it cant even reach heaven if you download this you will waste the time of your life
this is a good game when you feel horny and really want it like seriously i broke up with my dog and it really upset me but i played this game and was gay again this is seriously my life now wishes to all horny dogs out there prob twenty sixteen
really good game especially for a mineral style vowel exploration game live seen complaints here about the game not loading a lack of public servers there are over two thousands i can join and live had no problems but they seem to be either unfounded or due to very low end pcs trying to run a game they cant handle as for the claims that a bunch of blueprints are behind a pay all first of all there only a handful that seem to be premium or pro or chatham you second building blueprints a rent necessary for building certain structures they just give you what amounts to an easy mode building guide to replicate prefab structures the other pro benefits are just nice bonuses nothing necessary or even super useful of a flashlight but i can make torches by the dozen for almost no resources of longer sprint times so what its an exploration game not an action massively multiplayer online and its not like min craft int guilty of putting all the good texture packs skins behind a pay all esp on consoles all in all i think this does what min craft did but better id like to see more from this development team honestly
early access review probably the best battle royal game live played will play again prostate loads quickly matches are want to jump into another games performs better than most battle royal game ship firing is quite easy to second clunky control movement take some getting used to seems as if arm or does nothing recoil is high
early access review play this game for two hours and just i can say that a real cool game have lot of fun on that the is good but it needs more and better hope that the future game is good
early access review played this game for a very long time i started at the rise of the walkers and it looks like in stopping now playing this game the epic loot update is more than just its the ultimate downfall you have no chance to get what you want with the random crates and you get just a quarter of the robots as you would pay no done play this game thirty four years ago i would have highly recommended this game but not anymore in done with you free am
early access review this game is exactly what a free to play collectible card game should be no intentionally slow grind no level grinding multiple games demand most importantly you get to keep any card you acquire in the game
fallout shelter is a good fun little game where you manage the development of a fallout shelter the cartoon style drawings are nicely done the general structure of this game seems to have been well thought out you acquire resources to expand the size of your base recruit people and send out some hardy adventurers on quests the requirements for food water and power seem to be balanced the emergency incidents that occur have not seemed to be out of proportion to the resources at hand so far at least fallout shelter is essentially a management game however in some ways it is almost like a clicker game albeit quite an advanced one you have to keep on going back and forth between production units to keep the resources flowing and there are long waits for the completion of quests and the production of some resources and skill levels to encourage players to get impatient and purchase upgrades micro transactions sending vault dwellers out on quests can take a long time unless you use your bottles of nuke cola quantum which speeds up the journeying but such bottles are few and far between unless you feel like spending some real life money on buying some more yes there the catch your quester engage in battles versus enemies in various buildings but its action of just a very basic nature no first person shooting happens in the game the fate of those people who go out into the wasteland to explore is relayed to you via lines of text you done actually see them in action unless they go into a quest building which you have to authorise mostly the game is about managing the resources of your base or vault i quite like fallout shelter from my point of view the pros far outweigh the cons be warned that you will need a goodly store of patience to play this game which brings to mind the old prayer god grant me patience but hurry up about it so if you a rent a patient person you might want to let this one pass by but if patience is one of your virtues then this might just be the game for you if you re a patient person who enjoys a bit of post apocalyptic fun then i recommend that you give this game a trips people should be aware that there is a major problem with this game although it is easily overcome if your game crashes or your computer crashes then you can lose your entire game apparently its something to do with it then not synchronising with the steam cloud this drama has happened to many people whereby they have lost all of their many hours of game progress you need to back up your game the location for saved game files is in the second last section backing up your saved game files for fallout shelter in this guide help steam community id
this game is trash and meant for only the ultimate degenerates in this world done play this takes mad long to do stuff and the tutorial seems like it was made in a mcdonald bathrooms yeah done get this
i did like this game unfortunately although it supports linux when i try to launch it it instantly crashes well there goes about ten hours of downloading and there doesn't seem to be any fix for that nor do the deus seem to care why done you simply test your game before releasing a patch deus is on all the platforms you claim to support
early access review absolute garbage loved adventure quest and of and even dow but this this is just garbage the user interface is a joke the controls are a joke the audio is just horrendous the quests are uninspiring the enemies are stupid and just trade cool downs the inputs take seconds to register its not a game its just a bad joke this cant have been released by the deus of the flash mos we loved in our teens absolutely save your my on your sad this int worth your time
overview sorry the hunter i played this game after playing the amazing the hunter primal and the second i loaded up the game i was disappointed the user interface looks crappy and movement seems to be much much slower if you think in comparing it too much to primal then look at it this way movement is fairly slow in primal so in this one it feels like you are tiptoeing through the grass even when you are running its also harmed by quite possibly the worst free two play business model i have ever seen i just couldn't bring myself to play much of this game however i will say that when creating a profile with the hunter it is quite nice to pick an avatar for your character positive character character movement crappy looking user interface hunting licenses business model conclusion feel quite sad for having had to leave this review quite simply because i love the hunter primal so much it makes me feel grateful that it turned out so good even in early access you should definitely not download this game it hardly even counts as free to play
early access review first played this many months ago and decided to give it a try tonight only to find they have added ashanti cheat as a requirement while i get that client side anti cheat software can be useful and seems to have been needed based on forum posts i have considerable privacy concerns based on what each is requesting it be allowed to do on my computer the software itself has full access to screenshot key log and google searches have shown the results are publicly available for all to see the only limiting factor is their word that it only operates while the game is running while in sure there is other anti cheat software running on my computer in steam the data it returns to any third party servers has never been google search able i recommend the developers for rob craft force a migration of their users to steam and use steams built in anti cheat instead of using a third party app developer who obviously has zero clue on how to secure data being returned to their servers there no excuse for that to be google search able
the graphics are decent and the character customization is good there is a chat channel where you can ask other players for help info and there is a good amount of helpful people that said this game is missing so much it has paid currency gems referred to as lacrimal and that fine a lot of games have them what is ridiculous is that they are not account wide if you are a new character you cannot move them between characters you cannot move items that would be account bound on any other game between your characters so if you get something that is not traceable on your first character and then decide you do not want to play that class you are stuck with all the bonus or gem bought stuff as well as the gems themselves on that character there is a tab for lacrimal transfer but that int even available until level fifteen the skill tree is all kinds of confusing and there a rent any explanations in game to help with it for example one of my characters was an assassin and most of her skills had a when done from stealth bit in the description but no where on either chain or non chain skill tree did it say stealth nor is there a hot key for it the games version of stealth for that character is called incognito which you cant get till thirteen and it doesn't even say you enter stealth granted with most games there is a bit of figure it out for yourself type stuff but damn this was ridiculous i spent the first two days playing the assassin confused as hell then there is the gathering system you need special items for gathering as is the usual for a lot of games but the items in this game are applied as a buff for one hour which means you cant just gather as you go you have to use one of your consumable charges and go out and just gather for that hour and everything you gather goes into your inventory which int that many slots not getting a lot of slots is pretty standard too but upgrading it is crazy expensive in this game most of the features are not available right away only after you've gained a certain amount of levels you cant even click on several of the features on the main menu to get an idea of what something does targeting is weird sprinting is weird getting your flying mount into the air is weird i can get used to a lot of drawbacks in a game but i think this is the first game ever that i just cant get over the sheer amount that it has its a newer game so maybe they will change some stuff as it is i wont bother playing this one again
lets start with a pros and cons list of the game from someone who is not super big on free plays but chose to give this one a shot because it looked decent pro the deus are constantly working on the game to make improvements and bug fixes multiple game modes to appeal to a wider audience than just a handful option between first person and third person point of view amazing money point system where you gather money as you kill zombies and players and can use that money in the marketplace to buy things like extra ammo gear vehicles it center and its all stuff you can buy without paying real top dollar although they do have a real money form of currency for skins and to make your stuff look nifty but i mean come on its a free to play they need to make money someway and honestly id say this is not a pay to win game due to the fact the bulk of what you buy is just bullshit skins like a knock off counter strike global offensive thing talent tree is fun so as you gather experience from killing you can spend it to make you not lose health as fast hit harder less recoil etc replay is immensely impressive not choppy saggy at least not on the a servers if you re in the middle of killing someone and they try to auto disconnect to save their and so you done get points it doesn't work there a ten second disconnect timer for when scumbags try to pull stuff like that you can log off whenever wherever you want you do not re spawn in the same place regardless of if you connected to the same server would love to see more maps but hey its already an amazing free to play and even with just the few maps they have i never find them repetitive or boring because its all about surviving and while playing you re always so into just doing that that whatever map is chosen doesn't even matter while you re running for your life from a horde of zombies or a player whom you thought was friendly and is now chasing you down the street in nothing but a motorcycle helmet while wielding a machete so many pros but id like to go have a smoke break so onto the con this game is basically just a compton simulator or a canada simulator i done know both places suck run down buildings and speakers or zombies roaming the streets sucks you have to pay real mulch to get cool skins on your guns but aye just like case cancerous community but there always those few really cool guys to group up and run with when you die you drop all your stuff which sucks but aye that part of the game get over it or get off much love to the deus for being on top of their stuff with bug fixes and updates you guys are amazing and this is one hell of a game for a free to play smoke break time stinky pete
early access review maybe this game is not quite comprehensible and newbie friendly but it looks promising there is still no balance and everything feels based only on a players expertise and ability to team up for the victory for the fans of space combat games this is a definite must try
sorry to say that but this a pretty brain dead game if i really want to have me and my personal computer idling around i could simple engage the screensaver and look at the astonishing graphics instead of playing this and yes you need some more a lot more idle time should you really want to kill that first boss
the hunter is that haven game as much as i would like to recommend a hunting game that is this open and supports multiplayer it takes way too much time and effort to be able to do anything but hunt mule deer when you first start out you can only hunt mule deer and rabbits the trick is that you done have a gun to hunt rabbits with instead you have to earn currency by hunting mule deer in a couple different challenges and competitions which done give you enough currency to do much at all even if you do payt haven its for a limited time that you can access all the animal license and a limited time to access all the hunting grounds the only thing you get to keep is the items and guns and you have to keep hunting to get more currency to keep buying ammo for the guns you want to keep using except for the starting gun
alright its and idle game and that that having auto clicker i assume makes the game go faster but doesn't really defeat the purpose since there basically unlimited content lets do it the normal way minuses and possess unbalanced factions like literally angels beat every faction end game while elves destroy the mid game and farm coins like a goddamn twitch streamer being good angels fairies or elves does require pressing lots of buttons at least the game tells you that you re forced to go angels if you want to get good unless you done want to spend your life on this not dedicating life to this review either a there unlimited content how many coins ems will you be able to get and how many upgrades you'll get if you choose to be evil the games mostly ask you still have to press a button every once in a while and clicking buttons constantly will get you up there faster really chill and hooking like it should be you can grind for achievements in game its hard multiple factions to choose from which focus on different things such as goblins are fairly unique of now i wish this game some kind of train troops and fight mechanic would make it a little more entertaining from what it already is but its fine as it is i like it you should try it too if you want a clicker fantasy idle game or something like that
this is a wonderful game its one my favourite flight sim in the world that being said i wish we could control the infantry and move around there and not be limited to the vehicles that all i have get this game
not free to play not even a pay to win game its subscription int bank breaking but you also have to pay for everything else and there is a lot you need to buy to play it i admit it is a good game but not good enough for what it asks for id love to play it if it were free to play or even a one time payment of between five hundred and ten gap because that the quality of the the game but the money making scheme behind it turned me off it gonna pay a fifteen for stomping land and try that instead dinosaur someone let me know when they bring out an area three mod of this game
my roommate saw me playing this and described it as min craft for adults my best friend is a my pro limo and he is loving this game i have never played my but live seen it and just couldn't get past the graphics this game however is easy on the eyes live seen a lot of pay all complaints yes there are some recipes behind the pm it is not over half as described by others there are plenty of recipes and options to get creative playing for free the only major con i would mention is that your wearable gear degrades very fast and you'll have to replace weapons and arm or rather frequently when it breaks this is more painful at the start as once your set up well you can farm up what you need for the best a recipes and just replace as needed the minor con i would mention is that the lighting items are not equal in the amount of light given off the gas lamp item seems to give off the most light from any light source item everything else pales in comparison which can compromise your creativity in your build i generally only use the gas lamps because of this the difference in comparison is huge and you will notice farming materials can get a bit grind at times but a little creates a lot so really it just depends on how big your vision is and what your making if your not awesome at planning a build they have blueprints you can unlock which will hold your hand through a build i haven tried a blueprint yet but i like this idea they ran a bonus coins if you go pro event just prior to my two friends and myself finding and trying this game if they run it again we will all be upgrading to pro if you like contests deus seem to run them semi frequently and the prize is generally free pro upgrade and bonus coins to unlock recipes i never thought i would get into such an open ended game with no real goal that being said i find this game to be very addictive i am having a blast thanks for making this game my first pure builder type game experience has been very positive because of creatives keep up the good work and please run more pro upgrade recipe bonus discounts a
this game got me to buy a wheel its very funny reading all the boobs put hurt on this game because its to hard if a love racing and hill climb get this game is the free game is great a done even have to spend dosh lots of free content
early access reviews roll past the edits for the actual review important note played approx thirteen hours currently at la and have the basic guardian package onetime payment not required update one almost level twenty current max level i will extend or rewrite this review when they release the full game sometime this year two thousand and eighteen looking at the game plan in five thousand and fifty on some of the features like dragon crystals from watching ads aqua three dimensional website aqua three dimensional game plan which is a hard pass but ill grit my teeth if limited only to mobile and tablet so no pc the edits edit one missed spelling and grammar corrections credit to gram marly also what i used before posting if i get names or anything wrong please forgive me edit two made the a in dragon lords space between dragon and lord name the actual numbers requested edit three removed a space should be last edit sorry overview the game itself is a grind not so much like maple story two dimensional free to play sides roller but you do notice it most of the game as far as i can see for now can be played without spending a penny gear can be bought with gold or grinder for some gear can only be grinder for and cannot be bought with gold or dragon coins real money when crafting gear you can either wait the allotted time or speed it up with dragon coins similar to crafting systems in games like war frame however this is never needed and if you have the patience can by waiting doing other things like grinding levels resources it center story the story is minimal and kinda lacklustre but it is there there is no voice acting but the music int half bad it doesn't really pick up until after doom wood which is the dragons layer quest line in as fall it may be because i am a higher level or that its faster paced or a combination of it all but that how it feels for me right now optimisation i run on a crappy laptop and for the most part the game is easy running which is always a plus for me its no eye candy thank the heavens but it int half bad i was born in the a though side notes there is no minimal or world map in the game the abilities are really simple others suggesting a skill tree even a simple one would do most paid items are cosmetic it seems but alternative potions to the gold bought variants are paid including some paid only potions like experience points and faster gold potions also yes i have bought roughly two so far why because experience points is so minimal in this game i know the cap is twenty with one hundred being the max allegedly but please make it a little more than what it is although cant really complain as i done mind in the grand scheme of things notes on story apart from it needing a hell of a lot more content and features the story needing additions like voice acting choices and cinematic cut scenes maybe final say there is a whole lot more i could say but check discussions as lots of people have talked about and suggested much more than what i have here credit to all the ones i read and to dragon lord if you can put up with the minimal game play and story which for now i hope is only due to early access then i recommend this game or wait for full release also please only have micro transactions cosmetic only because the day that this becomes pay to win pay town i will quit this game regardless of my time invested credit and extra take care everyone and i hope this helped again credit to everyone in the game who has mentioned stuff people in the discussions thread on steam and dragon lord may
early access review okay okay let me just get this right they take away the level up system where everyone has a fair opportunity to grow the self and level up to get stronger and better they take away the go and re and replace it with crap now a brand new player can win a seeker or high level weapon and wreck everyone was the fun in that go back to the old system and keep it that way why break something that working so if you want to get this game make sure your ready to be disappointed
early access review this game used to be a lot of fun came back after being gone for a while and i miss what this game used to be i wish they had a classic mode for the older content and robots bought through the store new people to this game may find it enjoyable but i think in done with this game if i cant play the way i used to this review obviously is my opinion and it wont apply to everyone but man i just wanted to play the old content May
early access review ventured into the depths of this fun little mystery after quite a large amount of spooks i came across a messed up picture of kyd bey from mad oka magic one thousand and ten
pros good port from mobile stable fps ont have to worry about battery easier to manage decks and card more displays more info cons using the mouse is awkward especially when dragging a card to attack resolution is pretty bad and there int an option for full screen would recommend for returning players and new players
i have been playing this game for over a year and i have to say that before i knew about data two i never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain live ever felt really everything about this game is toxic and sucks the community is horrible as and so is the matchmaking people picking support heroes actually a rent able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team what they are actually meant to do they go for their in items first and done even think about upgrading the courier after minute three yeah and its unnecessary to mention that they sometimes done buy this courier at all so i am asking myself who in the hell into their head for them to do such stupid things it all about team play in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around and when there are already four carries why the do you the last one for picking go for a carry hero too that makes no sense while playing data two i discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me normally in a calm and relaxed person but data two forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life i realized that i can be toxic and salty like the rest of the too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are a again that why i prefer to play with friends instead of going alone if its your lucky day you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not then let me say this rip there is no more to say really you will get this cancer gang and the game will be de up furthermore you will waste more or less forty minutes of your precious time but trust me it will take longer way longer trust me and because you are a masochist like me you wont quit this game although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting data two no instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches you will get mad as hell learn russian and persian for free and this will be a vicious circle you cant get out of it you are trapped in this game its really sad live tried so hard but always end up playing when i have some time so here are my advices one never play alone when you have just started this game and done have enough experience yet always have some foods and drinks preferably alcoholic next to you because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win or maybe for more flaming schedule your free time its not only forty minutes you will spend on this game actually it will be more than this sometimes the whole day is ruined by data two once you start playing you cant stop anymore you have to be thick skinned or having nerves of steel there is no other way to endure this community you get it great then i wish you guys lots of joy playing data two three
this game is a cash grab if i had spent money on this game the mole rat invasion would still have killed all my dwellers this game is alright but i would not recommend spending money on a game that will randomly introduce a disaster and wipe out everything you spent the money on
early access review very magic the gathering in play style the free play campaign is very short and afterwards you are left with various gauntlet puzzle and other duelling opportunities not my cup of tea just because i prefer dynamic dec builders a la star realms rather than cogs where you need to dwell and ponder over constructing the best deck all that said the game graphics and play is all very well made
""
nice uninstall simulator never seen such good simulator in the first seconds the game automatically make you very angry in the next minutes it let you rage so much so you do uninstall the game in your rage trip automatically a and something more for only some euros you could play the game right because without you cant play the game just because you cant shoot animals the without the licenses nice job expensive worlds
my only problem with this game is the zoom i had the same problem with hotline miami if there anything that makes me sick its not having a proper camera view several hundred hours later okay so the game is really massive in depth i think there a story somewhere too it adds new content fairly often it feels good there a good sense of progression loot matters its super massively enormously huge in depth there thousands of different builds you can do pretty much something for every taste did i tell you it has some insane depth my biggest issue is server stability its super goddamn saggy when you re clearing really fast its not ping its not internet its how the game works i guess they could change it but i wouldn't know how i just know it feels like absolute stuttering and freezing even when you re one hundred first person shooter and is ping to the server you re on anyone who actually played fast before will also say this instances crash rarely but still way too often when a new league comes out there quite a few big game crashing bugs that take too long to fix the community is toxic vile garbage always some idiot that thinks hes right even though you've got thousands of forum posts proving him wrong trolls trying to trick newbies into in up their character completely or making them ruin an item or trick them into selling something worth tons for next to nothing egg does nothing to prevent scams they basically endorse it you cant warn people about a known scammer you'll get muted admins can be extremely obnoxious muting left and right for no apparent reason the game is still good despite all these issues you just really have to keep the social interaction down to a minimum at this point i cant really recommend the game maybe in next league they'll have sorted out some issues its just getting too old going through the same issues every time i play
early access review have two hundred and thirty six hours in this game i loved it until last patch coming up they nerf sub machine gun which is my favourite weapon they nerf rail gun my second fax delete megabit well this is the biggest nerf so much effort to build this monster but they are nerf weapons and remove megabits and this new skin salvage steric loot i hate it i lost all of my game money now i cant buy anything skin shotgun weapons ruin the game killing you in three shots they ruin this game so badly yeah hackers are gone but normal players gone too big the to developers now in gonna play crosscut its better from this a a a a
product received for free early access review in order to play this game you must already own it and have the game for a year because as so as you play people in low ranks battles will have guns from high rank so as soon as you start playing you will get drones with missile launchers obliterating anyone ever since they removed the ladder to get stuff the game has been bad i highly disagree with anyone getting the game
smite is a game with some nice character design and a unique perspective for a mob and literally no other redeeming qualities everything bad will be bad forever their sense of balance is a train wreck entered around conquest the basic mob mode equivalent to summoner rift in league of legends with zero regard for the two conceivably fun modes or any others though plenty of characters are unabashedly overpowered or horrible on conquest as well again this will never change unless its for the worse there is a continuous attempt to convince players to spend money on the game with many of the cosmetics vanishing forever often the ones requiring a massive toll of both time and money many more skins can only be obtained through chests rather than bought directly to extort more money from gambling addicts hire should definitely hire an actual programmer at some point every single patch is a storm of broken user interface functionality disconnects from the server and outright crashing hire hates fun they firmly segregate character classes with magical and physical being the main division and barring the one passive item no one of these types is allowed to deal the other type they also acknowledge if anything at all from the community the absolute worst suggestions made by the worst people which brings me to my next point the community is despicable you haven known hatred until you've experienced a not main on arena it may seem childish to wish someone actual real life harm over a video game but if any force on earth can cause that to happen its smite and arena is an actually fun mode despite having minions be too valuable conquest players hate you for not playing exactly how they want and also hate you because they are terrible about the game they are yelling at you over they only know one thing and that is that they hate you personally and wish you the worst life has to offer including being trapped in a game with them surrender is theoretically possible at ten minutes not early enough but better than leagues twenty but almost never passes the matchmaking is analogous to a war crime it appears to take the average los of two handfuls of people which means that despite the asymmetrical reasoning this creates you specifically get a team of people far below your skill level and must defeat a team only slightly below your skill level which means you a against fed players of course the company may have committed actual crimes because employee reviews have painted its co to be a despicable arrogant one representative man child who insists that balance is whatever he does well with play smite if you want to poison your soul so deeply that you feel contempt and betrayal even looking at a mob or a book on religion otherwise try literally any other game but still not league as it may actually be worse May
early access review its much better now than the first two days deus are fixing things fast and listening to the community done get influenced by all those you tubers this game has potential
early access review the perfect game for getting shot in the back constantly spawning in the same place and getting shot in the back again then spawning in a house and getting sniped through the wall then dying to a random airstrike there no matchmaking system whatsoever so you in your first match you will get matched with the freaks who dedicate their lives to this game utter garbage really
early access review space combat at its best interesting team combat but what i find most impressive about this game is the large diversity of ships with distinct play styles moreover the balancing is very well done so there are no ships which are simply better than other ships live put a lot of hours into this game and have had a ton of fun still in alpha now but worth it
early access review this game is a free to play knock off counter strike global offensive the guns are the same as counter strike global offensive and you even purchase them the same way too if you know how to play counter strike then you know how to play this there is even a knockoff dust and aim map its almost hilarious how this game even exists seriously do yourself a favor and just play counter strike it was kinda funny to play a really bad counter strike global offensive actually it was hilarious but i done think you'll ever play this game more than twice with that being said i cannot recommend this unless you need something to play until you can earn fifteen to buy counter strike global offensive
play as clocker goes to bio lab then ask back on keyboard pal are already swarming the place place a claymore not long after one kill rearming and do the same kill in a couple of minutes and not even one from my handgun
if you love building and crafting you should definitely give this game a try i love the community aspect and the adventures that you can explore and or build are lovely you can have a world all to yourself or share it with others you can create blueprints of your builds to share with others it never ceases to amaze me how ingeniously people use the blocks to create incredible builds the seasonal events are fun too and best of all the deus are still working on the game so new stuff is coming out several times a year all in all a lovely game to express your creativity
wow wonder what cool games are free is there any wow what is this brawl all wow it looks unique i will probably reinstall the game right after a match or two four hours later bahamas chalets spend money on best game on the world yes yes mammoth coins all hail the best game
access review like the landscape very much looks amazing graphics are superb eye candy what an in game atmosphere first person game mode is for me a wanna have and is more realistic well done so far very good created keep it going
used to like the game still play it a lot but only cause i dedicated a lot of money do not recommend anymore play something else hire has become more money hungry then dedicated at making sure the game is playable most likely new players will get stomped by max levelled masters players so good luck
superb game engine but spoilt by the fact that the docs are viciously expensive you cant even fire a gun in the free a which defeats the object of it being a training platform if the planes were cheaper or maybe in bundles that you could save a bit on then it would beat in hands down and i think more people would use it as their go to sim i love playing it for the feel and immersion of a fully interactive cockpit but i am not going to pay these sort of prices for a downloadable content unfortunately this seems to be the way on steam nowadays cheap or free games with extortionate docs to bring them up to what they should have been in the first place
as the first fallout game that i played it soon pulled me into the world of the other fallout games i quite enjoyed building my vault placing rooms however i saw fit eventually the game gets boring not being able to get more than two hundred dwellers but most of the time its great
early access review one of the best card games live ever played its fast dynamic and still very deep very balanced allowing many different play styles the interface is quite simple allowing anyone to approach the game from seasoned card grinders from other games to the new player who is looking for something new and fresh would recommend to anyone
i really like this game but after having to reinstall the game again i woke up to find my five or save gone simply gone so of if this is a bug fix it until then nobody play this
early access review looking garbage they count loading screen as play time so i cant refund this game be wiz disassociate themselves from refund cut they couldn't manage a game launch now that they ripped off the players of their fifty three on launch for the normal version they intend to go free to play and still not refund those who never liked or been able to actually decently play the game cut of their garbage management no joke i spent six hours on launch just to reach the character selection screen and once i did i got disconnected and i had to wait for hours again little did i know that those hours of waiting were calculated toward my playtime i mean truly be wiz re that desperate to get money as to fuck up every person that dared buy or trash game and count loading screen for playtime
know live always enjoyed blooms since the first game while this doesn't exactly play like the previous instalments in the series its absolutely a welcome change to me basically rather than a hoard of blooms that are set by the computer you play against others attacking with your own blooms while trying to defend for anyone that played clash royal its sonora like that except this came first ill also bring up how in single player blooms games you have access to every tower you've unlocked but in battles the battle lasts an hour at most so you can only use three of your unlocked towers and one more random tower this can bring up some interesting combinations letting you experiment on which one works best many of you may know that there a mobile version for this game while you probably cant take this version around with you depending on what kind of computer you have this versions frame rate is much better than the mobile version and due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics you can place towers in more precise locations in the end i done really have many problems with this game its a solid multiplayer tower defense however certain functions are blocked by a pay all so look out for that May
in rick harrison and this is my pawn shop i work here with my old man and my son big loss everything in here has a story and a price one thing live learned after twenty one years you never know what is gonna come through that door
i started playing recently poe about ten days ago its really addictive and fun in not the best role playing game player out there so it took me a while to understand the mechanics people were willing to help me out and explain some things i didst understand community is great completely free to play the only thing that the game gets money from is cosmetics
this game is probably one of the most unique side stroller games i have ever played in my life it combines two dimensional combat with three dimensional graphics not to mention the friendly community depending if you participate in dungeons or arenas with the wrong people in my own experience live only met few salty people but nevertheless the people are nice and are willing to help you if you re new i personally recommend this game because not only does is the game itself exotic and different compared to other side strollers this game is just awesome in many ways and will be the best game for you if you love anime
of this is my honest review its not a bad game its not my favourite game but i had playing the game here and there i suck suck a lot the vet thing provides a are a range when i got back but this didst stop me from recognizing some major problems most games are land slides which means you straight up win or you horrible lose every so often you have a close game its very rare such as finding a speck in the sand type of rare my first game had five fighter bombers on the enemy team if you so much had stepped outside you die if not by planes it was by tanks all i have are two mines and four names if i go anywhere near a tank it kills me crew spots me moves is being protected or drives while i am chasing it to but that at mine down in front of it i early find any rugs or panzer aust i have very few comments of pure happiness in this game finally catch a tank my support kill ten people i had stole a my bike while playing russians mining the entire house waited for a while enemy tried to cap and i blew them sky high those comment where all in bad games the main problem for me is credits money is scarce equipment cost a little too much twenty nine thousand five hundred for a wrench while i have a soviet vehicle which i constant crash well it would be a good buy if only i got it on my american tank crew man too also the cost to turn them into a tanker is costly one hundred and fourteen thousand that must be one hell of a tank i am getting if i am paying that much also binoculars which could be useful are twenty five thousand role playing game cost around one hundred and sixty five thousand which suck even more vet provides a advantage that kills off most free to plays like myself they get one more equipment slot and one more skill slot this kinda sucks for me so if you done mind fix your my fix your prices but hey its just me i guess have a lovely day i not going to say i hate the game but they do still need to fix it
very mixed feelings about this game i still play it a lot and it can still be fun to play casually but if you ever decide to go into ranked and try to improve there are some glaring problems in the games mechanics that cannot go unnoticed this game is not like smash in fact blue mammoth games tries as hard as possible to be different from smash so the mechanics are different and in a lot of ways simpler however this does not mean the game does not take skill in fact i believe that brawl all actually has a pretty decent skill ceiling however becoming better at the game int always fun especially when you re nearing the top you will soon realize that the punish game in brawl all is ten times harder than smash and some legend weapons in the game are downright annoying brawl all also utilizes a dodge mechanic instead of the standard block and instead of grabbing brawl all requires you to read the opponent and although there are reading patterns people tend to follow and moves that you can use to cover multiple dodge directions the enemy still has nine ways to dodge and eleven ways to react i done know why but i haven exactly been able to bring myself to quit the game yet i would always rage from ranked but come back some other day and i think it has to do with how accessible the game is you can load up brawl all and be in a ranked match playing a one versus one in under a minute no joke making it a great game to play when you are short on time old very fun casual game play aids ranked the higher you go flawed mechanics decent skill ceiling compared to smash although annoying to improve at highly accessible when short on time also the lag holy a a a a
i used to love data two however seven hundred patch playtime has diminished from thirty five hours every day to twelve games max and its dwindling further done get me started on monkey king valve let the game down with this patch horrendous user interface broken monkey king tons of changes nobody asked for
early access review really enjoying this so far nerf to damage for balancing purposes was mostly a good thing as certain content seemed way too easy combat really feels like it has weight to it and i find it fun live found the story quests to be enjoyable and live not found the world to be lacking in content there is plenty of stuff to do for some reason live also found the quests that are there to be more enjoyable than most other games again i think the feel of the combat helps with that
early access review a game that excels in building up suspense and laying it on thick with the jump scares when needed even if it is all random even in its unfinished form i can see this will be an indie hit i have attached a short play session below so you can check out what it is like tips youth bigfoot turn
this review is of course for the personal computer version of bethesda behaviour interactive fallout shelter it originated as a mobile app which from its initial launch in june twenty fifteen i enjoyed on my phone very much up to a point i remember being so excited to hear this announced at a the personal computer version works identically which means some pros and cons in the transition from mobile to personal computer the way games are designed on one platform or another can reflect the nature of the platform and intended use of or vision for said games fallout shelter is one of those that just works better as a mobile app ultimately it comes down to time gated activities and rewards its tough to sit down and play this for prolonged periods of time as a dedicated personal computer game on my phone it feels totally natural to fire it up hit all my resources queue missions and all that then close the game to check it later now there potential here for additions or improvements that bring the game more firmly into the personal computer space in sure anyone who tried it could brainstorm up a few ideas my own run towards a more fleshed out questing system and deeper role playing game elements id also request a combat speed setting of some sort on personal computer so i done have to sit through the plodding drawn out fights during a mission a little too slow as is i done enjoy how certain events seem to be scripted the specific example in mind is that some type of incident triggers shortly after game startup each new day in game or real time not sure early on these crises are simple manageable but they increase in magnitude as your vault grows presumably a bigger vault has more personnel with better weaponry to repel invaders put out fires etc term at some point though its just a death law raid each time so tiresome since death laws take a little while to kill and really burn through st impacts keeping vault dwellers standing that lengthy costly routine is the last thing i want to greet me every time i go to check on my vault it quickly becomes off putting its gratifying to see ongoing support for the game including balancing along with all new content quests items it center bravo they've also embraced the trend of seasonal events and mini holidays although that seems mostly relegated to cash shop discounts the cash shop offers various perks and upgraded versions of regular things that cant be obtained otherwise one noteworthy bug to warn you of on rare occasion should the game crash you may lose your save even if the files are still there regular manual backup of save files is the only sure way live found to protect against this in giving a positive review since this replicates the fun of the mobile version just bear in mind it cant necessarily be played for hours on end like a conventional video game that should be apparent from the outset tip frequently back up save files tip the help section is useful in that it explains some mechanics info you couldn't learn by any other means june
early access review when you cant afford counter strike go it center just get this edit bow i started playing this game in twenty seventeen when my friend told me about it when i was a free to play we just started playing but now we done even see each other anymore so playing this game will never make me forget him
early access review one of the best games out there right now similar to magic the gathering in a lot of ways but much more accessible and usable online tutorial int great but once you re over that hump its fast to get into the game and build some cool decks
early access review mode is an arcade shooter similar to the call of duty or battlefield franchise it features a selection of game modes maps and weapons the player base is decent if mostly russian due to the developers being russian and the game as a whole is built in unity what war mode brings to the table is pure simplicity it has low requirements under go for space and its ninety nine free only thing you can buy here are some masks but they re only cosmetic and are a way of supporting the developers the game however is full of bugs broken mechanics and hackers it int a very good substitute for any of the paid competitive shooters checking it out costs nothing but it has nothing to offer either
i played this game for hours before it launched on steam so i feel i can give an honest opinion hearthstone players play intelligence in this game it has all your ring cards that you love no seriously you just stumbled across a no longer hidden gem in the competitive card game market elder scrolls legends is by far the best one out there easy to pick up meta is diverse the in game rewards system is very generous remember the arena in is its here but there also the solo arena you play against the artificial intelligence the story is good too there was recently an expansion called the fall of the dark brotherhood made available that added new cards to shake things up just give it a go and i promise you wont be disappointed
it would be better if it had a bit of beaming drive physics but its already a beautiful game the prices for the downloadable content are too expensive for example the us the plane that i want till i first saw the game is one thousand two hundred and ninety nine its too expensive nine hundred and ninety nine would be a lot better the graphics are amazing there int a more detailed game that this on the controls are hard to learn but if you learn them you'll have a lot of units the most complex plan flying simulator its even better than fax flight simulator a go get it everyone its free unlike the docs and amazing
this is not a review its more like a guide towers that a need wizard ninja and monkey the strategy is too have a tier two wizard save for lightning and the other upgrade put a monkey or another wizard to upgrade it all the way sold be able to get lightning for or wizard at and round four if a had been saving do that and keep sending pink and yellow blood if the enemies is doing the same thing prepare for a zebra or a metal blood rush at round thirteen or round after having or normal monkey and or wizard done do anything until round thirteen at round thirteen click on began and send in the type two zebra rush like there no tomorrow it is almost all the time a guaranteed win if the engine does not know or doing a rush
i played the game like one year ago went level fifty in less than a month then i stopped playing due to some real life more pressing issues tbs i want that much invested into card games but after playing gwent in pitcher three i discovered they can be quite entertaining this game though is very much unlike gwent at least the old online version because the new one had lost much of its originality and revolves entirely around the is universe and lore with a very nice and immersive mechanic the cards are rather cool and i do enjoy the graphic style and overall design the premium cards not so much someone got lazy there because they have just some background effects instead of a full blown animation like the gwent ones i can see that a lot of people have complained about the new interface and connection lag issues but so far after like one thousand five hundred and twenty days i have yet to encounter any such issue all in all its a solid card game and especially after they included the attribute sets with great replay ability if a care more for the story stories than technical perfection in conclusion i really done regret the time spent with this waiting for the elder scrolls i now
broken game in its current state only because of how unbalanced it is way too easy to just save up and send regeneration rainbow blooms balance your game ninja kiwi not a fun game i know it says i have no time put into this game but that only because i played countless hours on other platforms when playing a match you can either use your money to buy upgrade monkeys to defend or send blooms at your opponent to increase your income usually that would be find but around wave one thousand two hundred and thirteen if your opponent saved up money for a few rounds can just win with like a seventy success rate the ability to do this discourages players to get to further waves like three thousand and forty why waste thirty minutes on a game you could end up losing when you can just save up at round eighty nine and send rainbow regents and win in like ten minutes you done have to play many games to see how infested the online play is with this cheap dirty technique without a doubt the majority of players play like this and it makes the game a fun to play
early access review fractured space in its current alpha state plays well polished the development team is good at keeping the news current and features are added tweaked in response to feedback from the community are there some good old alpha antics yes but they seem to be few and far between overall my only issue with the game is lower player count leading to occasional long matchmaking wait times i expect that this title will continue to grow and when it is released in its mature state it will be phenomenal as far as game play the controls are pretty smooth and intuitive the battles can be intense at times your success is largely dependent on your ability to think strategically and respond tactically it focuses on teamwork the leroy jenkins will fare poorly good luck and good hunting
well tired to do all the shooting in the fallout universe ever thought of staying in the copy place even building a vault after the bomb imagined yourself as an overseer well this is the place
very nice graphics and refined game play interface is a little bit of a mess and of course it employs the usual free to play strategy of making the game pretty slow to level up in and then offering a premium currency to boost things up despite this its definitely worth playing
this game is absolute garbage it takes hours to travel anywhere and when you do get there if you re lucky to even get near and have the patients too you get sniped by some guy two towns away there no objective to this game its literally run find guns fight people die lose all gear since and repeat the battle royal is trash as well it doesn't register you as playing alone so it would put you in with teams so it will be you is four guys done even think about running because you cant run faster than jogging speed done even bother wasting your time
dear whomever it may concern it a my absolute pleasure to recommend realm of the mad god thoroughly enjoyed my time playing realm of the mad god and came to know it to be a truly valuable asset to my steam library it is fun expansive and has incredibly great graphics alongside its undeniable talent realm of the mad god has always been an absolute joy it always manages to foster positive discussions and bring the best out of me and my friend without a doubt i confidently recommend realm of the mad god to join your steam library as a simply superb game and all around great development i know that it will be a beneficial addition to your collection please feel free to contact me at suomi email com should you like to discuss realm of the mad god id be happy to expand on my recommendation happy gaming gnome may
early access review this game is a real good break from my dark souls play through and as someone who has played the last few games of this it is new but brings back memories the connection int that good but that is to be expected
i haven played card games beyond gwent both the mini game and its independent variant between the closed and open beta the mechanics of gwent have changed for the worse or at least are very much up in the wind at this point this showed up on steam and although very different the wide variety of mechanics are rather enjoyable oddly enough there even a story which int half bad try it out even if you a rent a fan of card games my only complaint would be that the special version of a card looks like compared to gents usually they just have glory added to them in this game
early access review seeing battle on in three dimensional is wonderful as an adventure quest worlds player i always wondered how it would look like this game somehow still resonates with me its true there is a lot of grinding for experience points but the players live met were friendly and didst hesitate to help with the harder bosses live reached the maximum level which is twenty atm in about two weeks so its not that bad there is also the story so they a rent really that boring take my advice farm in as fall dragons layer area you get high experience points from the quests there and weapons i like the fact that this is cross platform and it even remembers your quest progress if you log off before finishing the quest a fun game to play when you re not home as well from your phone you can play on your computer and then continue the quest on your android phone for example bow its full of spanish people so if you know their language you re in luck but also people from us us and other places many of them are on twitter and i like the fact that most of the fan base are old adventure quest worlds players so the average player is older than as player base there are guild groups if you re interested in that and many discord servers
not a copy of hearthstone tries to fix bad hand and no comeback problems by letting you redraw starting cards once and for every five of your starting health you lose you draw a card with a mechanic where some cards can be automatically played from this draw lots of cards that are interesting because of effects other than their stats magic a ring lets the player that goes second tap it once a turn to get one magic a your resource to cast stuff three uses i personally think this is overpowered and should be reduced to two charges as it makes me want to go second so i have a field advantage for three turns but that me and would need more input and testing to make sure unique two lane system some say it helps ago decks some say it helps get around defensive wear down decks if anything it is new and the lanes are actually different one lane makes creatures unable to be targeted for one turn by enemy creatures so the situations you get into are interesting a fifty card deck minimum but only gives you a three card starting hand one on draw means that the vast majority of the time you wont get the card you need to effectively counter the enemies opening strategy unless you have a lot of that counter really makes you fell like half the cards in your deck are useless because you will never get to them even with the draw on lost life yet the arena draft mode only lets you pick thirty cards so i done even know cards that help you if you re winning and done do if you re losing these cards mostly involve the if you have more health than your opponent do some crazy thing for some factions their effects are fine but for others the effect basically keeps you ahead for a good few turns on its own as your opponent tries to do something about it while he is already at a deficit a card upgrade system for some reason few people talk about this but it is prevalent enough a small number of core cards can come to you at a base level through the story more cards to new players is good but these cards are mostly worse than their upgraded version the cards can only be upgraded when you reach a are specified level and done think its like every level for the first ten or something one took until level seventy five when i looked at it you can get the upgraded cards through packs so you can wait for ring or fork some cash the big problem with these is how some upgraded are straight better than the upgraded the upgrade just straight gains a new ability with no increase in cost or any downside this leaves players with the terrible choice of play a card that is worse than your opponents or have it sit there for however many levels no reward for losing the game gives you a daily mission each day and you can hold up to three there is a counter for every three wins you get some gold and a single random card however if you lose you get nothing except progress towards a daily mission in really tired of this all it does is try to get you to fork over cash so that you can get some better cards or new strategies this hurts the people trying to learn the people who lost a very close match the people who lost from a bad starting hand it center
early access review good thing this crap is free cause it is not worth the space like they always say you get what you pay for and your not paying for anything so done download it why cause the matchmaking for new people doesn't work or you will just be waiting for a long time to get into something
early access review germany is way too overpowered soviet is way too weak game is unbalanced tanks are too overpowered aiming sucks evening takes way too long germany and america has lots of guns and soviet about the half of those guns game is not ready to be played yet maybe after patching eight hundred and ten
breeding simulator of the millennium you literally put two people in a room with music while the rest works they pretend to understand themselves get into a room she comes out pregnant and he with a smile and never talk again old good game you done have to spend a cent literally but the game is so fun you'll want to buy something might get a little slow without those colas but its manageable you play this game like game for example
product received for free if you like dragons and adventures online like me you will love this game but there are some errors one there a rent so much quests two the graphics a rent so good almost everything costs gems
graphics are of but the grass is terrible i would crouch down and it would have me stuck looking in one spot the whole time and when i tried to move it would move my gun and not my body i like the feel of the game but as some of the other reviews say you need a license to do everything its stupid go buy cab las big game hunter instead because at least you can have some kind of fun with that two hundred and ten would get stuck and only allowed to move my arms again
i want to love path of exile i really do the developers are amazing and they've created an action role playing game that far surpasses the scope of diabolo three they keep pumping regular updates and the new season ladders keep content fresh the story is there if you want to get into it but you a rent going to play this game for the story the game play is absolutely amazing if you have a good build and that where the game falls short for me building your character is brutal and unforgiving in path of exile a couple of mistakes ensure that your build becomes low tier garbage and you have to either spend hours grinding for regret orbs which let you re skill one point each or you have to build a new character from scratch some people enjoy this kind of rigidity i do not i cant honestly enjoy playing the game when half my time is spent alt tabbed into the build maker and character build guides online just so i done mess my character and turn it into an unplayable dung heap
its of pros reminds me of gran tourism good physics cons so many pay walls about ninety of the cars and ninety five of the tracks have to be bought just release it as a pay to play game and give us all the cars and tracks done give us a slice of the game and tell us to buy the rest id gladly buy all of the game were it to be released as app game like i said barely any cars for free and two that right two of like over fifty tracks overall i give this game a six hundred and ten purely down to the realistic physics and the fact that it reminds me of gran tourism
great game would recommend came from the phone app this game has a lot of depth and the rabbit hole just keeps getting deeper i had probably close to fifty to one hundred hours in but only had like half the achievements any way looking forward to the game not freezing up and whatever stupid phone however the font is horrendous its too small for a laptop size screen game developers please put in a font size manipulator i already have glasses i done need new ones
i played it for two moths every day and i still couldn't make a good deck and the game is extremely broken sylvan and fury decks are too overpowered would not recommend it i played elder scrolls before it for two months made three decks one of which got me to legend
monkeys that live in the jungle and in zoos are infamous for throwing us stuff stuff of their own making this is a fun game human opponents add a new twist assault mode provides layers of challenge and strategy you can also use your funds to purchase gadgets that will keep balloons from slipping by your defense including tack machines and cannons you may rightfully ask why would i want to bother those agent monkeys that may be but machines are capable of delivering blows that a simian cannot and vice versa whether you decide to put your trust in the monkeys or whether you employ heartless machines instead you have but one purpose to make sure the balloons don to get past you each one that floats by takes some energy off your health bar lets assume they re filled with mustard gas interestingly sending balloons at your opponent can help you accumulate a lot of cash which in turn can be used to really shore up your defense as a consequence assault mode is excellent for players seeking a real challenge especially since some balloons have different effects that can devastate an army that a not been properly upgraded to counter them that it and it why i love it so much May
this game is garble it is a massive bungle and i just get bare unlucky and that init and havel is bare lucky and that init pure bad i rate one hundred and ten do not buy i would rather own a peugeot two hundred and eight in poo stain brown
enjoy this game very much its like hearthstone but elder scrolls the story is very short spoilers three chapters long so if a beat every boss the first time it will take about four is hours the dark brotherhood expansion story is really expensive twenty other than that its super fun and will probably eat up a bunch of or time
this is actually a really good game not great but good a yes sometimes the game crashes or the loading screen takes time to load and you still need to click the mouses right button to rotate but nonetheless everything else is okay graphics and audio is okay cute baby dragons and custom able items though you need to be a member to access buy the cool stuffs
early access review creatives is a great game it pushes our imagination to the limit and beyond you can build great structure in this game with many blocks which are unique the negative of this game is the taming system is still bad i recommend this game for someone who like to build a great structure out of blocks
early access review my grandmother almost died to cancer in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three she managed to survive and was struck with it again in nineteen ninety ines but yet again survived but she was hit one final time by it in two thousand and eight sadly she died but in all those three cases of cancer together this game gave me more cancer than my grandmother survived all together nine hundred and ten would considering getting intense cancer
early access review have been playing for two or three months now and this game while not perfect is a lot of fun and truly free to play i have not spent a dime yet but as another mentioned they almost felt bad about how generous the free to play is so i may end up throwing a few bucks out to support the game i have completed all the campaigns currently available and have stock pile of gold to use on the new shadow campaign once it comes out i may play for two hours or so at a time a couple times a week i ago ask for extended periods of time so my playtime int as much as it appears as far as player versus player goes i done put a ton of time into building a deck or doing any research and have gotten to gold one last month not saying that any kind of achievement but for a casual player with a lets just have some fun while i listen to podcasts i feel satisfied with it i like the flexibility with the power system May
early access review yet another card game completely destroyed by suspect deck randomization for whatever reason my account was marked so that i had only two choices draw power at under ten or over eighty the mandatory construction was thirty three power which i bumped up to forty but it never mattered ten or eighty totally worthless not fun and after two hundred hours trying to find a deck build that didst leave me with nothing but power or nothing but cards hey deus get a clue thirty three is approximately one in three i didst draw one in ten or id draw eight or nine out of ten its stupid so your game is stupid
get this game it is freehand down times better than any first person shooter game on market bad field four rest by planet side cod rest by planet side counterstrike rest by planet side of rest by planet side two
ignore the five hours that just the steam version in in tier five america and have a positive kill death ratio in the a mustang to anyone who has ever played this game long enough you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of christ for anyone else let me tell you why this game has so much potential to be good but it squanders it in the silliest of ways so let me just get this out of the way it is russian biased not even gonna lie done have to because in in the safe steam forums where kab i mean foreigner developers cant execute my posts imagine this its a terrible day to be a tanker the germans have a tiger and you have one russian tank model nineteen thirty four in real life you win by number advantage in war thunder you win because the tiger decided to replace its arm or with paper and lined its hull with high explosive ammunition i can not believe how many times i have been ammo racked in a tiger you can be shot in the tracks and your tank could randomly explode how does foreigner explain the game is still in development that why when tanks first came out lets just reduce the listed capabilities of all german cannons by about twenty or if you wanna be technical model it at fifteen degree before even regarding what you re hitting so technically you could hit something dead on and still be penalized fifteen degrees and just be glancing off is this just one case example definitely not every time they put new stuff in the game while completely ignoring existing issues if its russian they just say screw it raise all of its values from the previous plane times that by two and make it a ufos if its anything else case example the twin mustang which is literally a a times two is actually now twelve in value instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically they add in more planes and with the twin mustang were too lazy to even code the second engine whf logic is that look in not going to recommend this game this game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me were given false feelings of love frankly the kick that i can get out of this game is winning in a tiger or a because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that i like if you play for that i applaud you but for everyone else flying ufos planes and world war two to you are so blind to how bad this game really is bow i can agree with many of the other negative reviews but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people the funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues but still think this game is worth it i done as a world war two history enthusiast i have been pushed to world of tanks that how bad this game has become at least war gaming has a method to their madness here make sure you pray to rhesus
best why dry is filing personal computer gaming simulator live played for a long time game itself is crazy detailed and if you have a week spare to figure out how to edit registry settings and re download the game several times id give it a positive edit on cooler head live change the review to a recommended game itself is really good little dated of wish but competent would like to see the deus remove the dry from the steam version
absolutely destroys any arg in every aspect free to play no pay to win endless replay ability and countless more good things to say if you are into areas this is your way to go forget about every other game
i got this game with a friend because we were bored and i am not disappointed its true its not a perfect game but its free at least pros this game is fun when you play with friends or alone survival open world if you want to challenge yourself more open world is more player versus player based because you can find at the start of the game a lot of guns and hunger thirst bars degenerate at a super slow rate in comparison with survival mode the maps are big i only played two cal wood and colorado i done know if there are more maps cal wood is just a city but its a decently big map on which you can play on tips if you done want to get killed get on less populated servers common sense dutch i recommend playing survival first so you can get used to conserving ammo and food also you can learn the map colorado or cal wood depends what you are playing and you can learn about some existing items in the game too in open world you can find items way more easily rather than in survival mode cons bad map making just be careful where you walk i got stuck in a bus once if you get stuck just get something to kill yourself with a grenade or something almost nonexistent character customization depends if you care about looks or not there are a few glitches or bugs here and there but i done mind them because they done ruin the game play they are actually kind of funny cd clans can be made only on open world and also they set up only for the specific character you have selected and it kind of sucks friends too but that only when inside a server you cant make lobbies so that you and your friends spawn in the same area loading time takes a long time like fifteen seconds it spawns you in the game before you join the server so you might join already dead if you done disconnect in a good spot
early access reviews game attempt ohio you need to spam mouse one and mouse two now i get ind game attempt i get the combos now a attempt rank game this game is so hard month attempt up to current i wanted to win but how i tried button mashing that works i guess of decent two dimensional plat former game nickname button making simulator twenty
game is to i know met game is always to but in this game is absurd i mean at least in freaking hearthstone you have like four or eight decks in the season meta that are actually good and competitive but here you choose between two or three and its so good boring the developers even give you lots of free stuff just to keep you playing a perfect skinner box until you realize its just that its not even a game i mean look at the time i been playing this in freaking legends and i hate item judges una be que al metal ego simple is una per in este judges absurd me refer a que al menus in al jodi do hearthstone tine como enter four a eight decks competition differences a elixir for tempo ada que son bueno a competition per aqua tines de two a three decks yes tampa an burrito los dear adores incl so re alan miles de costs para martensite enhance do una perfecta casa de skinner pasta que texas cuesta que is solo so no is nisi beira in diego diego tan solo siren al tempo que leo uganda est soy jodi a legendary to ohio
ever since the developer switch this game has lost its charm granted that it still plays the same and some of the loading screen times have been reduced the game play experience has suffered significantly the table itself is reminiscent of hearthstone with less emphasis on card artwork animations and voice acting and more emphasis on parrish color minimizing detail and reducing actual game time
note plus read about elemental evil more down in my review as i can only recommend the game until lvi the game itself is like wow on many terms as both are based on and pan and paper game however never winter has in my opinion the actual better fighting system because it doesn't feel as stiff as the wow one because you get feedback on cries and the characters actually do attack faster its hard to explain on the few aspect i can say it is like in many other games you can have everything free if you one have no actual life and play a per day accept that you will never have the gear to be good at player versus player but you are gonna be good enough for raids and stuff have sense for economy and trade stuff to make profit its not really that easy but i read about it but i honestly never tried that also you can get the premium currency called zen for free as exchange for astral diamonds these astral diamonds are the currency for the in game market and auction house so basically everything besides the premium items these diamonds you can acquire by completing daily quest trading items to other players for astral diamond buying zen with real money and exchange them for astral diamonds that the way to speed up getting actual decent player versus player gear opening chests with keys you can acquire from premium store for a little amount of zen sometimes yields more astral diamonds if you sell these items but its quite a gamble having these points said the game is pretty similar to wow but i prefer it due to the more responsive fighting system and the ave quests are more obvious when it comes to moving from one area to another in wow i actually had to google to which area i had to go next cause there was no followup quest also all the expansions in never winter are free so if you done wanna play player versus player ever you can enjoy this basically for free update on lvi sixty content introduced in elemental evil expansion sometime ago there was the module module expansion in never winter six introduced to the game called elemental evil many players looked forward to this expansion but unfortunately i must say it int that good that is mainly because cryptic the game developer added new areas to the game which is always a nice thing but these areas are recycled from the old ones and only contain the typical generic massively multiplayer online role playing game quests also to make things slower you have to complete three times sixteen quests for each area but you can only have four quests at once and these quests are very boring so i done recommend this stuff also the level cap was raised with this module from sixty to many players expected new endgame content to come because of that but cryptic just recycled the old areas to level seventy and every player has to grind his old sets again which makes many players leave the game and i can honestly understand that so overall i would give this module a thumb down but as the game itself to lvi sixty is still very enjoyable i will leave it at that but i cant recommend trying to get through these quests its not worth the effort
early access review gotta say i am impressed never knew about this game till free weekend and i am getting into it now battles look amazing and game play is fun on a good team graphics are solid its still in alpha and pretty good
in ready to be down voted into oblivion for what i have to say but i really have enjoyed this game so far i understand better than anyone the war community has been spit on and dragged through the mud to many times everyone is so ready to just highlight the negative aspects of the game but in willing to admit there are some good features in a four year war veteran who has played all the knock off of this game so let me say this is so much more than just another remake a lot of people are talking about pay to win if they spent more than a hour on the game they would see the abundance of loot and how easily shop currency is acquired just through playing i feel like its balanced when really the only thing you cant get through looting is simply weapon skins pop expected to see a onslaught of cheaters with the thousands of new players but even with the dozens i have fought today i have yet to encounter anyone even suspicious the player versus player is fun and plentiful i really missed the feeling of killing a group of people and seeing them each pop like pinatas the rush i get from grabbing the loot is something i could never get from another game for any old war players or new people reading this for the time being i strongly recommend giving this game a chance despite what others say
early access review so this game is cross platform so you can play here then on your phone then on your tablet and back people here on steam posting negative reviews done seem to understand that so they are just bashing it without doing research and understanding why it is what it is i have since played this game more and i have to say it is very light weight cheeky massively multiplayer online they now have raids dungeons multiple classes crafting think a more third three dimensional run escape for free it int all that bad and i feel it is worth giving it a go if you want to just mess around and have some fun there are micro transactions sure but they are not in anyway required as with the two dimensional version of the game
of id whf happened so i was playing the game for a long time and realm was life then i stopped i had three accounts one for steam one for kong eat and one for the online version the online version was my main and kong eat and steam were just accounts for storing after i stopped playing i never really thought about it this was like five month so now i try to go on my steam version and it just loads until one hundred and it stops i had a ton of important items on my steam version and now i cant access it please help
this game is a whole lot of fun its like world of tanks meets a mob except space ships capital space ships there are many ship types and each is interesting and fun in its own way each match runs about thirty minutes with a competent team game play heavily favor teamwork i see myself spending a whole lot of time in this game my only criticism the ships handle like submarines subs in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
in both a gun nut and a simulator fan and this game simulator are somewhat of a beauty the only problem for me is my own mental capacity i just cant remember where the part go high detail and the graphics are above nice i like it
early access review this game is the best you can progress a lot but still needs a little bit more in it like to chop down trees faster because those trees are so damn big from one tree you can get over one hundred woods besides that the game is really good
save yourself the trouble and go play another game that does any sort of simulating or realistic combat scenarios on the ground or in the air this game for the first year or so of its development release and subsequent updates was a good game a fun game a game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of war gaming world of tanks fan customer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes all that changed with the introduction of their bullshit riddled battle rating system that they would with each patch adjust each planes and ground vehicles when they were introduced battle rating to fight enemies the players whom make up a top percentage and excel within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else every goddamn patch time and time again you see a major increase in the number of soviet aircraft with their ufos like flight models outperforming even though the soviet ufos should never have gotten off the airstrip other aircraft that make the ufos seem like a volkswagen the same exact is occurring on the ground as you see some bull russian tank model nineteen thirty four get ammunition at a thirty three battle rating think sherman and barely up gunned panzers with higher velocity a that can penetrate and one shot a tiger a tiger at medium to long range all in all i would hope that those whom would be interested in this game go play another game armoured warfare world of tanks or something besides wasting your time on some piece of that foreigner refuses to get anywhere near balanced called world of soviets of wait sorry war thunder as they claim its called
are you a fan of hearthstone and enjoy all its bullshit and last minute tricks that fuck you over at the last minute do you want even more bull fakery and butt hurt than that well here is the elder scrolls legends with even more butt fakery than hearthstone you'll get fucked six ways from sunday in a dual lane system that bound to fuck up your day a rune system that will most defiantly tear you a new a hole in so many places people will start calling you swiss cheese prophecy and ongoing effect cards will have a threesome with your rotting corpse and if you thought i was done in far from it if play mode didst have enough butt hurt for you then test your luck in the arena mode with nine mother fuckers to defeat in a completely unfair and bullshit game modifiers i rate it would like to be a fucked again but in all honesty its just a really good game
early access review this has been my go to for over a year it feels like the depth of mtg but they've made it play smoother in a digital space its truly free play new players can quickly collect enough to have at least one very competitive deck and build up from there there is a draft format where the cards you pick are added to your collection there are free repeatable puzzles available after the tutorial that start simple and go quite deep into the rules and interactions in the game the tutorial is just plain too long so if you decide to give eternal a try prepare yourself for that have some nice snacks and a ball game to watch or something
saddle this has the same problem mtg has for me your resources are in your deck i know a lot of people like this but i just cant play a game where i might draw everything i need to play but cant play it cause i didst draw resources or i might draw only resources and be god dan useless yes card games are random but separating resources and decks was the best thing i ever saw and cant bring myself to go back to card games like this
i started playing smite about a year ago and i was hooked instantly the concept of mobs had always intrigued me but i struggled to enjoy the ones i tried because of the mouse movement controls and isometric viewpoint among other reasons when i heard smite was a a person was controlled mob with an emphasis on skill shots i had to try it and in glad i did the game is a fantastic team oriented experience with a great depth of the character design and implementation is amazing the lore of mythological gods battling is a blast and the variety of abilities skills game modes events it center has kept me coming back for more ever since i started try it you wont be disappointed
early access review played when it was part of paladins for the day it was great and i like the changes they made as a stand alone game too although it can often seem like nothing is happening which leads me to the only things i would like to see done like a smaller map for more intense play and maybe some cross game currencies and battle passes like my gold gems and by on paladins should be linked to both games as originally it was going to be one games think all the fans would love this same with the mobile game maybe even some skins to id how or if they could but it would be cool to see a buck skinned to on running around the realm
early access review when this game was first released it was amazing i loved it to bits and when the battle arena mob game mode and the boss battle was implemented i thought they where crazy fun best things the deus had put into it sadly after the updates that followed the implementation of the battle arena and boss battle i am giving up this game after sixty two hours of playing it and reaching level ninety eight due to the fact that they have implemented micro transactions loot crates and other terrible game modes and the deus literally said on there twitter they are changing the game and if you done like it fuck off just not in those words the deus got money hungry like other indie developers do after a year or two it really is sad seeing such a great game become a micro transaction based garbled mess goodbye rob craft
great idea but full of bugs and crashes many of the quests are not able to be completed due to crashes every time to try and finish them then you get to start them over and they crash at the exact place again and again done bother installing unless you like a lot of frustration in your life thumbs down
well i was enjoying it until game four when i kept experiencing heavy lag and i saw tanks go threw mountains and tanks appear out of no where and ohio its not good but i think this is funner than world of tanks the first one because here its right to the point really nowhere to hide the other one lots of places to hide took to long to level up well thanks for letting me try in heading back to warm unlimited live been working on a house for several days and in dealing with a cotton farm i planted cant wait to sell off my crops and finish my second level to my house
early access review amazing game not so easy to learn also hard to master you have to think about your opponents next moves this game is not just about muscle memories absolutely recommend it
early access review cdr one more round late for work solid first person shooter that has entered my rotation go to free to play game i keep coming back to and have yet to get burnt out on personal highlights below no pay to win only cosmetics and even those can be earned over time only played tom for now but i enjoy this more than any a a tom games available remember when first person shooter games bragged about their gun selections this game is what all those failed to deliver on plenty of weapons to play around with tactical reload round in chamber means one less round in magazine hence the two thousand nine hundred and thirty ammo indicator runs smooth even on a potato free live spent more time with this game than five of the last a a sixty games i picked up combined
early access review be me downloads rob craft out of respect for genres and for trying it out not very original so build a giant battle royal joins game finds a friendly player with a craft in the shape of a triangle fly into triangle let your mind put two and two together whole team laughs triangle guy gets mad because they cant move so he she rage quits lost the game because the whole team were at spawn laughing at the events unfolding its free so just try it
what a brilliant game and it is unbelievable free i love flight sims and have cliffs of dover is flight sim a but not a plane because it is a bit pricey for me i was after a modern combat flight sim and somebody recommended digital combat simulator world i have only played seventy even minutes just the first couple of tutorials and i am in love the amount of content you get for a free game is amazing and puts other payed sims to shame i am already looking at buying the of and a downloadable content the free to play strategy does work if you put out a quality product like digital combat simulator world which gives you everything that a full price game offers but then offers you more as downloadable content for a price because like me you will pay that price
terrible performance hit and crashes since a they just keep adding features without fixing the issues the multiplayer totally inaccessible at all at this point it freezes the machine and i can hardly shut it down
i love this game completely i done think that anything is wrong with it yes you can pay for items but it int required i done know what it is about this game but i just absolutely love it please try this game out it may seem like i haven played it for long but live got some good playtime may
early access review usually hate battle royal games pub left a really bad taste in my mouth after beta so i sold my beta outfit for two thousand and never loaded it again i was hesitant to try roe but in so glad i did the game does so many things better than pub and it runs so much better for me this also being free is awesome for a free a battle royal game this is unbeatable
in not personally a very good player but i have played a lot and i really enjoy it so heres some information that may help you decide whether to get this free to play game in advance i suggest you go to youtube and watch some of curious or another you tubers videos about planet side two this game can be pretty confusing or overwhelming at first but these guys are very helpful i would also like to point out that while the community is full of salty vets who post on geddit about nothing at all they are very helpful if you ask them for advice they will help i would also like to warn you that your performance may feel like your a potato shooting marshmallows at teleworking space aliens that an exaggeration by the way curious also has some helpful videos on how to fix that if you stick through and keep on playing you'll find that this is an amazing game that nothing else can compare too another plus is that you will be coming in without any prior knowledge so you cant complain how the deus ruined everything as a side note see above salty vet when you start and this is for you who didst watch any youtube planet side two does not have skill based matching this means that if you think your a real bad ass player on over watch or something like that in planet side two your fighting against everyone with no restrictions to skill this may seem like a bad thing but its really not now go watch some youtube it will really help though i suggest avoiding igor or for now you can go scar yourself latter now go have a good time and watch some youtube you'll notice i used all caps to make it look important and spoiler it is May
great game for those who have a cheap wheel and are just getting into the sim racing community while the community is small this game is great for this who wish to build up skills in order to tackle larger racing titles such as racing or asset to cora this game is extremely unforgiving you need a wheel in order to enjoy this game and it is hard done be discouraged when you learn the skills and get used to the driving model the game is really rewarding while the expansion cars do cost money the base cars are great to get hours of great fun pros cheap initially good force feedback great graphics lots of cars and tracks costs money great sound cons gets expensive if you buy everything low number of online players might just be because i live in australia hard to get started some tracks and cars are ridiculously price overall review seven hundred and ten
decent game not perfectly balanced one of the better card games you can play it on android gwent is way better than it but hard to compare the two really if gwent was on steam and android it would overtake this by a long shot though the new expansion should breath life back into this game though it has a magic the gathering feel but with better mechanics not too complex easier to play than gwent and more convenient sorry for the comparison but those are the top two card games right now beside capstone that doesn't balance their whole game so that will never be played again
could not register the confirmation email never arrived the help form on their website did not work kept complaining about a missing category selection there is no such drop down labeled category all in all a pretty shoddy programming job tried to register in a different browser and the site says both my username and email has already been chosen which means the problem is on their end and not with my fat fingers
early access review realm royal i am not a huge battle royal fan but i like what i have seen so far as with most hire games i usually find myself able to enjoy their games and realm royal is no different i done know how successful the game will end up but if you are a battle royal fan or a high re fan i think you should check it out
good fundamentals pretty fun to play edit game gets seriously stupid as you get higher up in play godawful men godawful customization controller support godawful godawful everything except the actual game play edit the game play kind of sucks too
stupid question but how do you play it on vive i installed it and it runs and just takes me to a login screen with no instructions or anywhere to click to sign up or create an account or anything like that also there are are no instructions anywhere on how to operate the user interface i see a white dot as i move my head around but how do i click on anything there are no instructions or help anywhere that i can click on sorry for being such a dense idiot i think its going to be great if i can figure out how to even get in there
early access review fantastic little game really enjoyed getting scared by adorable cardboard spiders first run i made it to level three hundred and sixteen all i gotta say is whf good job on this very disturbing a eight or nine hundred and ten
back then in alpha i use to a a a king love this game all you had to do was just farm robots and level up and unlock new crap but now everything is completely different different in a way of a a a king terrible weapons are unbalanced servers are saggy as hell players are toxic and rude like in playing with a bunch of nine year old and all the staff in this game are pretty much a a a king useless in general i now understand why this game managed to get a mixed review best part the chain gun was released months ago and you still say its a new weaponry how is that progress
this game is really good i just love creatives i just wish the pro downloadable content was a little more reasonably priced in india otherwise this game is the best edit i bought the pro downloadable content almost hours after writing this review the experience was good and i could make the game easier with the new unlocked world options i can now safely say that it is worth the price
early access review game has real promise does it need work sure it is alpha what amazes me is i play on a lower end laptop and it works and doesn't look half bad not great obviously but very playable really hope they keep up the good work and they done try and bleed the player base dry from what i have seen though i do not think they will try to pull any bull on everybody would i recommend someone getting into early access yes absolutely need more people playing edit really needs a system in place to discourse people from disconnecting from a game i know that will be some time off if it does happen and i also know that not all disconnects are not players quoting because the game is not going the way they think it should trying to be nice but something will need to be done eventually
i was plain dis dumb game crazy i name two of these dwellers as shane and lori and suddenly i am getting raided by goddamn raiders really original so i look and shane is banging lori in the social room and she comes out like seems pageant and that reminds of things and fuck this game
infestation the new a
its childish like many have said before me i haven played it for hours on end like i have other games but it seems to be a lot like wizards one hundred and one i would let my younger siblings play it and i think its fun for when i want to just sit back and relax enjoy a little bit of wandering plus i got an awesome two headed dragon also it allowed me to say that my character had been to another universe which gives me some research on the stories i plan on writing for her
early access review decent free to play first person shooter game it takes a lot of time to advance in the game for new players it may seem like an endless grind but i get the idea behind why they made it like this but play it long enough and it really feels more like a chore i really like how you can ride a bicycle into the battlefield though makes for some funny moments May
this is hands down the most realistic hunting simulator available today its not easy and its not cheap but nothing even comes close in the hunting game genre yeah it gets negative reviews from people who either have no clue about hunting or can to afford the game but its an awesome game if you like to hunt or think that you a like to hunt the landscapes are immense detailed and very realistic each of the many maps is a work of art the sounds are realistic and captivating i wish it were to so expensive to play and maintain membership but once you have all of your favourite gear the membership fee really in to too bad considering what i be already said if there were something better for less id definitely be interested but live looked and there int so until then this is my hunting game of choice its free to try so why not try it and see what makes this the best hunting simulator available today
one install low get level fifty three meh this game int for me a month later install low get level thirty three nope in not play in this game another month later install smite org this is the game of my life i done know why i like it so much get level three hundred and four still play in
access review compare year two aqua three dimensional to year two adventure quest worlds and you'll see just how far artie entertainment has come apart from being an absolute for a games this is hands down the best massively multiplayer online live played items that can only be obtained through micro transactions are strictly cosmetic only every stat changing item or class is farm able grinding is not nearly as annoying as adventure quest worlds not even close and if you go through the story linearly there always a fair bit of challenge to the enemies as your damage and defense scales with your as well as your enemy level combat is relatively enjoyable compared to other more popular mos classes are generally fun to use and nothing is so hard to farm for that you lose all feeling in your legs for slightly darker boots if the progress of adventure quest worlds over eleven years is any sort of indication aqua three dimensional will be smashing wows in a couple years would recommend
fallout shelter is the best free to play mobile game ported to personal computer this personal computer version its definitely more comfortable than the mobile version for me its better this way because i no longer have to spend my phone battery to play including that the mechanics and loadings in this steam version are more improved than in the mobile version
access review its a fun game and i done see why pal done like it there is nothing wrong with it i have not seen any game braking bugs the grind is fun and it keeps me interested all day maybe about five hours and more
early access review after jumping a little bit from spider and pumpkin cutouts i decide to run down the hallways backwards it seemed like a brilliant idea at the time i walk into a room see weird goo on ground realize this is when it gets in terrifying read emo love poem on table turn around scream girl quit game really fun one thousand and ten scarier than amnesia
game play is really fun and competitive especially when the team is working together even though its a pug only downside is asia server is currently unstable and lag a lot which makes a lot of asia player to play in north america server instead though it doesn't affect too much but if you re using a center or of position the ping matters overall a good game and being able to swag out your character makes it even better i made a big black guy gave him blonde hair and slapped on a pair of fancy glasses and then named him fat hes fabulous done judge
early access review in a big fan of the old world war two online this game however is one big grind est filled with pay to win players and cheaters if you want to have an experience similar to heroes generals rank structure i suggest you join the actual military although i guess even over there they have a faster progression in rank then this game has ten stars edit because of reasons let me paste this here i played the beta for over thirty hours before it was released here on early access they used exactly the same progression model
early access review have asked for a refund for this game four hours is all i needed the game is terrible just go play guild wars two this is the fourth time this game is being released and it is utter garbage ftp in five months or less if the game lasts that long graphics would be nice if this was two thousand and twelve but the game play is terrible please get your hard earned money back and use it for something else that the best advice i can give you
live played for a couple of hundred hours with the mobile version and to be frank the personal computer port itself is pretty blockbuster as it fails to add any new features besides the duel log on the right and enlarged card description on the left while playing however the game itself is great and its good to see its available on a new platform so ill give it a positive rating do note however that the game is really and while you can put together a good deck for free there are several decks which are nigh impossible to make as a free to play player at least an optimal version also the start of the game is really slow so if you re not willing to grind and get through the boring part of the game it may not be for you still with enough patience or cash it can be a really fun and rewarding experience especially in player versus player duels May
finished the story in three hours arena is quite cool but overall its not worth spending money on the second story is about as long as the first and they want gap to unlock i think not pros free to play the one story you get is pretty good the mechanics are probably better than hearthstone which is its closes rival the deck types are quite cleverly laid out and have good internal synergy willpower is generally about helping your creatures out whilst intelligence is all about direct damage and energising off of action cards for example arena is fun micro transactions will get you back in though in not sure you get the cards you pick which is a letdown cons cost its micro transaction based fine but done then charge me most of the cost of a full title for one three hour story expansion you've got to be kidding complexity for all that its probably better than hearthstone its not a patch on magic the gathering the mechanics just a rent deep enough very pay two win didst pay out for the booster packs sucks to be you then all in all its a nice idea but its nothing more than a transparent cash grab in the end with some clever mechanics though outdone by magic pokemon and even yugo if they lower the costs then the story modes might keep you interested for a while but as of right now play it until you've done the free stuff then drop it and done look back
i only played it because its the only game that has tanks that even remotely realistic that live found i discourage playing this game because of the developer foreigner german late one hundred and ninety four thousand four hundred and forty five second world war tanks fight postwar one hundred and ninety four thousand six hundred and fifty three soviet and american tanks you can see how that turns out there also aircraft same deal tiger is and panther aus is face is on a regular basis of and the russians get prototype aircraft which never saw service because the guns broke the aircraft in looking at you yak
early access review what happened to this game honestly i remember this game when there was levelling and item tree before mega bots god i miss that game because honestly this is a different game completely
early access review nice game requires heavy teamwork one big problem about the game thirty five hundreds players online but it takes ages to start a game matchmaking kind of sucks finds players five thousand six hundred and seventy nine then resets starts again like ten times
could be a nice game no one wanted them to add anything new to genre or stuff like those only needed to be a properly optimized fresh massively multiplayer online too bad even that they couldn't manage
this game looked very fun at first but to do almost anything in this game it wants you to buy something the controls a rent that good either as the handling on the car is awful i would not recommend this game
live never played card games unless you count monopoly this is my first and its not the least overwhelming with game knowledge its simply easy and fun to follow i think in going to be playing this for the weekend then give another review but right now as it stand i would recommend this game
absolute pay to win game done waste your money online gambling for kids the fur hire and spell book and the rampage forest decks are so overpowered that you are guaranteed to lose in thirteen turns because of how game breaking they are this is an obvious pay power where if you done buy these witch cash you are given the worst card ring imaginable where it requires literally no skill to win because you can literally summon three monsters in one single turn with additional effects where you are guaranteed to lose if you are a parent keep your kids away from this game otherwise you will be finding yourself with ridiculous micro transactions on your bill kenai should be indicted for literally introducing online gambling to children because anyone who claims that this game int rigged you are delusional or an idiot the abilities themselves literally control what cards you are able to draw you are better off buying physical cards instead and playing in person because kenai cant rig your card shuffling this is how they trick kids into putting money into their game because not only do you have to buy the most overpowered decks they make sure they place free to play players against you so you can get that mental rush like you are somehow good at the game influencing you to buy more when they introduce even more overpowered decks its an endless cycle i put in about one hundred hours on android and i knew that it was pay to win from the start they rig the cards you draw i literally filled it with mostly monsters and only drew only my spell cards in a row i had fifty monsters and fifty spell straps and literally kept getting only spells or only monsters i even made it seventy monsters and thirty spell straps and still got nothing but spells somehow i was only using the peak performance skill the entire time i even put multiple copies of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicates i even experimented my card draws with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful cards which were always conveniently placed at the very bottom of my deck i have mostly played with my friends and they literally saw it on my live stream that i would draw similar cards during my first or second turn and we even played about three thousand and forty matches in a row only to happen every single time they even rigged the dice roll cards to give you the worst dice rolls as much as possible as they are powerful and would allow you to stand a chance against the pay to win decks it goes against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for using the right cards at the right moment i have the dangerous machine type and it literally gave me a six dice roll eighteen times in a row across all my matches always self destructing my card each time i only got to use it to its full effect only two times and the rest was nothing but one or i mostly played with my friends and even when they had cards more powerful than mine i have won more matches against them this just proves how massively rigged the ring system is and did my own personal research the match doesn't make any sense and pretty much forces you to buy the most overpowered decks behind the pay all if you are free to play be prepared to lose a lot of matches and do a ton of grinding to unlock skills if you done believe that the card draws are rigged they literally have a feature called skills that can be applied to your character how is this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain cards out of their butt that completely breaks the game what a joke here is a list of the so called skills that can be activated below balance if your deck consists of ten monster cards and ten spell rap cards you will have two monster and two spell rap in starting hand draw sense spectra can be used each time your life points decrease by one thousand eight hundred in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw a random spell rap card destiny draw an be used each time your life points decrease by two thousand in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw the card of your choice draw sense high level can be used each time your life points decrease by one thousand eight hundred in the draw phase instead of doing a normal draw draw a random level seven or more monster heavy starter if your deck has three or more level five or higher monsters with different names you will have improved chance of having a level five or higher monster in your starting hand
early access review the game was good now a great pile of or a community early good support team doesn't give fudge about you i wonder how long this game is going to keep it up not so long i guess any many many many many bugs which development team and support also done give a fudge about balance in every single aspect is horrible at the end i done recommend the game no matter the fact that is free to play with micro transactions by looks of the other reviews you can see people are not so fascinated another thing to the guys who created this pile of or a a i know its not easy to create develop a game but after a hard work development the good game you wasted your hard work time on slowly but successfully up the game that is not effective waste of your developing time and by that i mean you us cd at your profession feel free to ban me if this insulted you because i know you ban other players without any good reason and clue it wont be a new thing if you are venting on players who leave a bad review
of so i understand the hate about this game and i agree some aspects are a little bad but over time i feel that these issues will resolve themselves even there are bad things about that game there are also good things about it too like original movie soundtrack and they even have the original movie cast as well even though this game is rough around the edges i believe that it will continue to get better
it would be a cool game if it was actually free to play this game is pretty much pay to play and pay to do anything fun multiplayer required a subscription so do the weapons and licenses which have a time limit fun for about five seconds do not recommend to my friends
early access review love this game love the snowboard and the hang glider which make it much more thrill to move around enjoy the scenery of this snow mountain ply do more optimization on full screen sometimes get below sixty first person shooter when moving
early access review first off please done judge the game based on its long annoying tutorial this game is excellent in its current state there are lots of card games out there and this one has a few things that put it head and shoulders above the rest in my opinion attacking and blocking rules similar to magic the gathering even the fastest aggro decks require a little more decision making than in hearthstone because of this a very generous economy i have invested some money because i want to support the developer but by most any metric eternal is the most free to play card game out there free ave with decent rewards interesting mechanics and not too much randomness many viable deck all together the strategy is deep and the games are a blast give this game a shot and struggle through the tutorial
early access review awesome game play with good game mechanics but if you re new and done purchase good ships from the beginning without even playing the game properly you re gonna have a hard time finding a game live spent this entire time writing this waiting for a match soon yeah
a ever quest we meet again this in nostalgic time sink is something that i wouldn't really call a video game an adventure rather an experience a phase it comes and goes sometimes it lasts for a long while sometimes a short burst a lot of the time you find yourself returning back to basics and such this or is very different to the first ever quest yet still deep and loving you can explore with friends and go on a mystical journey or more importantly you can go on your own the lone warrior adventurer explorer you will fail you will succeed you'll dance laugh cry heck you'll even fall asleep you will gain knowledge of the lore acquire sets of particular skill view many landscapes and battles till your eyes tear up ever quest is now on steam and in the heart it hast changed a bit although the population is now three the graphics outdated and i done recommend it at all i lied i do recommend it the thousands and thousands of in hours that live spent scream at me to recommend it even though i done want to its ever quest or your life you choose you only get one childhood and one adulthood nor rath or your in life play it or done doesn't really matter to me the original is deeper and worse for your health this one is slightly more casual just watch where you step
early access review amazing game live been playing since early beta and have watched the developers update fix bugs and make improvements on a daily basis very polished for early access so much funny two requests is that the developers bring back the old map as an option and also create an oceanic server if that happens it be a nice addition to the best massively multiplayer online shooter ever
great yugo game that still active online also i can transfer my mobile account to personal computer version that great and i spend more time on this game somehow i think its need community like guild or clan in the game so we can requesting card or whatever this good game
i like how realistic it is but the only downside is how much you can do for free you have to pay for the rest in my opinion you should add all the animals and half the guns bows and pay for the other half of guns please and dank you all in all its good
fun little time waster if you are in between games or waiting for something packs seem to cost a bit much got the legendary pack with humble bundle so had a little boost its not for everyone but its not bad
matchmaking is a joke in this game for tanks it everyone is us and planes for us is side climb for min and die because they are always still higher than you you will always be up tiered no matter what foreigner will never listen to you you will always get the spawns for a map because balanced map design is a in joke to foreigner if you want any possible fun play anyone but us and us because they are just there to get curb stomped foreigner and this game on the positive side its a better than any war gaming game except the ships
if you like diabolo and was discouraged by diabolo three or just want a great free version of the such then get this game the graphics game play online and even the story makes you feel like it want free it can be original in its own aspect but keeps it simple and familiar to you personally i loved the online play and the customization of a home but the trading felt a little odd for me but it still works eight hundred and ten
i was really hoping to like this game but sadly i had to uninstall it i was doing pretty well when the game crashed when i logged back in i still had my dragon but my quests started over so it wanted me to hatch a new dragon but i couldn't it wouldn't let me move past that quest even if i tried restarting the game i had to delete my profile and start over only for it to begin freezing to the point i gave up
early access review a very fun third person shooter mob set in gee dee space all its very tactical since the ships move and die slowly it has a great balance of mechanics to keep you hopping around the battlefield trying to push grab gamma which gives a combat buff and push on base its in alpha at the time of writing this review so there are bugs abound but surprisingly playable despite matchmaking connection issues lag and other bugs pros very tactical teamwork individual skill ships have different graphics except gamma and bases which i believe are stand in models cd is very transparent with their development model and even allows voting on certain game play issues in game boosters are used when you want to use them they double the experience points or credits earned on a single battle friendly community cons lots of disconnects right bowling internship unlocks are still being developed honestly i hate to put those cons in there since it is alpha but just to inform anyone wanting to get this game there are still quality of life issues
graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don to look too long at it paint exam play got very good good its just game play mesh starring at walls is better just don audio orgasm very good good not too bad bad array audience kids teens adults average solitaire player pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boil iii ask casa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press a easy significant brain usage easy to learn hard to master difficult dark soul grind nothing to grind only if you care about leader drinks int necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you all need a second life for grinding story if you want story then go read a book text or audio floating around average depends an downloadable content good lovely it all replace your life game time long enough for a cup of tea short average long to infinity and beyond price there is no price but worth buying premium worth the price if a have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying assassins creed unity get a bug spray or more a lot more or maybe a flamethrower or a nuke
its a nice game better than wot because wot can sometimes be brutal but their is one thing i hate about this game its the money system i keep loosing money i didst even use my abilities nor get killed in early rounds seriously the money system here can sometimes be annoying loosing a big amount of money but the game is really fun playing with friends is what i like the most
product received for free early access review cdr this game used to be great however it slowly descended into incredible grind ness and reliance on random rewards outside your control i want to preface this review by saying rob craft used to be a good game combat was fun building was fun and your performance was influenced greatly by your skill to an extent it still is fun fighting is still fun and so is building but whats wrong now is progression and rewards before the latest update epic loot there was an role play correction patch role play is the currency you used to by parts players were earning too much in certain game modes and not enough in others they were made equal however this was still a giant difference between old and new role play rewards this extended the time it took to buy certain end game items by hours if you sold a part you received exactly half the amount of role play you used to buy it here is the bad part random rewards as you can probably tell role play provided an easy way to predict when you could afford a part robots often need four to twelve of the same piece to function correctly building robots was easy and fun it didst take long for you to slap that shiny new anti air cannon on your robot now you done get role play by playing instead you get a crate this crates probabilities of getting a better item are so small you shouldn't even try these crates do not factor in time played or the score you get or any other thing you do in battle it only cares about leader board position and wether you won or not parts you done want can be sold recycled for a set value crates based on leader board position is a terrible idea currently everyone is fighting against their own teammates for that shiny purple crate kill stealing and tower stealing are extremely popular tactics however the problem has gotten better with armageddon as all crates are boosted two rarity levels meaning many people can get the purple plutonium crate for some reason sell back prices recycle rates for parts was greatly reduced air there was nothing in the patch notes for epic loot that this would happen recycle rates for the cheapest block fell from fifty to ten the highest recycle rate for any item is air thirty three this is a massive artificial extension of the time needed to complete a robot the second worst part about this update is we have not received a reason why epic loot was delivered to us free am is giving the illusion of communicating with their player base by making polls for which vol quality of life features we want implemented first mark lead designer and co of free am released an article on robert game com titled state of the game may two thousand and sixteen mark says he doesn't want to implement one of the changes suggested by the community put currency in crates he says they wont do this because he doesn't want a currency based economy my question to him is why free jams community manager reads almost all threads on the forums at least he says he does he doesn't always answer them you cant expect one guy to give an answer to hundreds of threads a day can you he does respond to some of them but he never responds to many threads asking why epic loot was made or suggesting solutions to the problems mark also didst address any other solutions to the problem many of which are extremely easy to implement one solution being to raise recycle rates of all parts to fifty no response you could say that epic loot was the straw that broke the camels back me being the camel breaking meaning me writing this review there have been many terrible updates before this one team orders and rob craft unleashed are good examples another problem with free am is that they seem to think we will stop playing the game after we get to level one hundred and fifty and have a robot we have completed this couldn't be more false if the game is interesting we will continue playing honestly done expect this game to get better free am has never completely reverted a major update only one small feature friendly fire we done even need a complete reversion we just need to buff recycle rates live never written a steam review before i have trouble writing essays just let it all flow out i guess even though i only have a little over one hundred hours live played this game since october five twenty fourteen to mark co of free am why did you think loot crates and random rewards for doing well were good for this game what was wrong with currency why do you think we progressed too fast in the past i want this game to succeed it used to be great the best game live ever played i want this game to be like that way back in october two thousand and fourteen the game was perfect the core game play was decided on it made sense regular content updates like weapons movement parts and most of all maps would be enough to keep me interested in sorry i just cant recommend this game to someone without them also writing an angry review and uninstalling too if you see me in game in likely grinding may
early access review its an early access game i understood that when i bought it there is some bugs but there also an update every day fixing things the translation is getting better by the hour and the developers are actually trying live played three classes so far highest on a ranger and really enjoying the game i like the scenery i enjoy the combat its quite fun there lots of room for growth and i hope they read the zen desk suggestions because it has the potential to be an amazing game in due time
path of legends is another great indie game to add to as records of achievement you start of with a selection from various characters these include lulu the dark witch baric the holy one and lastly master i the forgotten avenger i myself played as i and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there in any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the dead swamp pirates i was engaged to be married and had all of his family on board the cruise at the time unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child i tried to resist but was overpowered by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the dead swamp pirate assault amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game there nothing much to it at first you are lying face planted in the dirt you learn to survive as you craft with various tools immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands but i suppose this could be attributed to i being a bad ass and so it can be justified eventually you can build yourself a nice hut and after you do some rather grind farming you can establish a good forward outpost you get promoted mid game to purchase station cash from the money online entertainment website to speed things up but i never was a fan of downloadable content so i done support as decision to monetize indie games like this after you build the forward outpost you get to fight the first boss a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of is personal struggles from his japanese heritage the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section where you meet rico from just cause two rico gives you the grappling hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game fortunately for us i gets to swing around the area pretty quickly the hook allows you to make it to the central island where the plot thickens once i discovers there an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment i approaches the base in a friendly manner but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life the game turns toward guerrilla warfare from his point on you need to take out key military installations over the island such as propaganda stations and fuel depots to try and win over the local populous once you've garnered enough strength you can take the military he head on to liberate panama from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island the final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the he which span deep underground i uncovers the secrets this place holds the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship hired mercenaries trying to obtain a rare artefact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about this clearly explained why rico was on board and this was certainly no ordinary cruise the artefact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromancers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by tom altman from this point on i knew what he had to do and where he needed to go space the game ends with i having a choose to destroy the evil facility or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the brethren moons once you make your choice you can hitch a ride on the ebon normandy a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight you can take with you some local acquaintances you met on the island or just go solo in any case you leave the island and make your way to eden prime and this is the basis for the second instalment of league of exiles which we here at indie folic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on until next time stay snazzy gamers
at first when i played this game i wont lie i got hooked couldn't stop playing at all trove is a really fun game but it is very time consuming to me this game is kind of a love hate relationship but from the amount of hours that live invested into this game i can tell you i would definitely recommend this game to anyone here are some of the pros and cons about the game just in my opinion pros very addicting always something to do lots of new content being uploaded into the game unique variety of classes each one gives you a whole new experience promotes creativity fun with friends not a more so pay to boost fast up is fun only when your power rank is over fort five hundreds at least easy character customization same with weapon and gear customization cons servers lag and throw you around the manga also may result in being forced out of game gets repetitive might need to take breaks from it now and the requires a lot of farming and grinding especially when you hit la twenty in game also for in game money seamounts servers are down lots its a really great game when you can actually play it from servers being derby a May
early access review having played pub and footnote i prefer realm royal as the map feels very diverse with different climates in each pocket of the map and not the mention the unique class to choose from which differentiate itself from its competitors it is still rough around the edges and the animation seems clunky but given that it is in alpha there is still room to improve its not a rip off of any battler yale and it has a potential to be a damn good game i recommend trying it with an open mind and not be an like the footnote fanboys
early access review think this is on my top three fave rote tags of all time just wish they added more draw power to make up for the fact that seventy five card decks with min twenty five land makes mana screw happen quite often
我这是第一次写一个游戏的评测 不知道该说什么但我只想说这是一个好游戏 不管是跟小伙伴连机 the the the a 虽然没有中文但这是一个免费游戏 我们还能要求什么呢 最后我就过分一下吧 the we need chinese nous avon bes in de chino sir bra chen chinopotrzebujemy china cosmos de chinese of of the китайский the a องการภาษาจ นχρειαζόμαστε κινέζικα
early access reviewing only played a couple of battle royals but this one feels much better by far its not goofy or cartoony the environment is great and the weather changes really add a challenging dynamic that changes strategy and difficulty of each match there some minor clipping and display issues i saw someone sneak up on me because of a graphics glitch and i fatally fell down a gradual slope that should have been easily walkable the developers seem to really be involved and address issues raised and in glad they re taking this seriously and not treating it as pay to win or a
quite possibly the best free to play game out there it definitely follows the core mechanics of diabolo but does them even better hours upon hours of fun with friends highly recommend
early access review this game really started out with so much potential but it all went downhill when the deus decided to make the game pay to play whats the point of playing when i could just take out my credit card and get whatever i want the point of a progression system is to let people learn to play the game before giving them all it has to offer but if you can just buy your way up whats the point of a progression system the thing that personally pisses me of the most though is all the unnecessarily useless features in the game like weapon repairing and the fact a scope costs more than in tank honestly the best way to fix this game would be to delete everything and pull up a save from a two years ago it int to late but in the state it is now i cant possible recommend it to anyone
have you ever wondered what a game would be like if the developers gave zero flying a about balance look no further do not play this game or the original if you done plan on spending at least three hundred on it its literally unplayable after the first week trust me your hair will fall off its unavoidable if you download this crap there not much else i can say in one hundred honest when i say that this is the most stressful rage inducing poorly developed game i have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming you can quote me on that update game is one less added ring loot crates also added more premium hit guns
early access review here do i begin when my friends and i started to first play this game it was a blast but this new update was the one of the biggest middle fingers that a developer has ever given me the fun is gone weapons are still more expensive than going to college i rank up slower than grandma walking up the stairs and it is less balanced than a seesaw with a sumo wrestler on one side and a thirty pound preschooler on the other if the developers would stop sniffing cocaine out of each others a and start fixing their mess i might return otherwise planet side two is starting to get me very interested meh
a very good hack and slash game or dial like if you want to name it that way that free to play but not pay to win in any way it becomes a little grind in endgame but besides that poe is a fun game that offers a lot of content for literally nothing it might become boring if you are not into creating new characters to try out builds or find exploring some areas over and over again boring worth at least a play through in my book
joined a server a person there explained where i could be to hunt the stuff that i had an license for and its pretty funny one a get into it sadly you need license for a lot of animals so its kinda hard to know what a can kill and not kill when parent using your tracking device
disgusting i call for a boycott on game newell for allowing dangerous terrorism training tools into the hands of children and remember he does it for free shame on you or newell
early access review this game is awesome a when i download it i thought its another version of counter strike go and i wont play it unless ten minutes but now i am playing the game for hours daily dpi recommend this game for all the shooters lovers not only counter strike go lovers note i done like counter strike go but i like black squad three
path of exile has to be one of my favourite games of all time live put a decent amount of time into the game and live still got a lot of things to learn in a huge fan of hardcore and i think it really adds to the game when you first get into the game it feels slow and you have a lot to learn if you take the time to get past that hump and stick with the game in sure you'll learn just how good of a game it is
this is simply another example of what happens when developers abuse the free to pay game model the prices they charge for content is downright criminal if you already own a serviceable rifle it literally costs more to play this game than to actually go hunting the free or guest mode allows you to hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits which gets boring after a few hours you have to pay for licenses for everything else which are time limited bow this game is basically worth a point of sale purchase price of about twenty five if you buy into their gimmick you will spend upwards of one hundred and fifty that is what these developers think about you
if you spend some time on this game it will defiantly hook you up yes you will be addicted before you know it this game has so many interesting aspects which you will discover soon after you start playing it the best thing about this game is that it always have room for improvement and new content is introduced every couple of months which assures that you wont be getting bored of this game so easily
you'll have a hard time finding a game with more possibilities however to reach those possibilities its a look long grind especially on your first few play through disappointment can hit hard when you get to high levels and realize the character you poured one hundred hours of your life into doesn't really work that being said its a very fun game love the graphics the style the whole item skill and passive system and its definitely worth checking out its a game in which there are almost always more things you can choose to do
early access review first of all this game is not a smash clone it plays pretty different from smash however it is also better in many ways the inputs and mechanics are very clean balance issues are dealt with quickly and the development team is great super responsive to the community would definitely recommend playing use a controller
early access review this is my first review on steam i feel the need after six years of being on steam to express my deepest disappointments and frustrations with this game done waste you time with this game if you are thirsty for a new massively multiplayer online queues to play are almost inevitable especially if you and a group of friends started characters on the only server that was available to you during the early access founders pack release i gave this game more than a fair chance i bought the deluxe which was stupid of me to do and hope this game would at leased be have legit gently playable but it hardly is it might say i have twenty two hours of game play but i have thirteen of actual play time the rest is me sitting in a queue to play only to be disconnected after half an hour of playing to sit in that same queue again and again this is the first time live ever felt compelled to get a refund for a game live purchased and i will admit i pursued a refund after my hour played because i have seen people get a refund and have put in more time than i have in the actual game but in not expecting it the game is no optimized the main city you'll get max fifteen first person shooter no matter what graphics card or cup you have the game was completely overloaded during its prerelease which is to be expected normal but this is the fourth region that this game has been released in so they should have expected this and its ridiculous that they didst seem to prepare for it in the slightest way possible when i started there was one server for eur but they claimed there was two there is now six or seven servers and three of them are full theses are just a few issues live experienced personal and i could go on but i feel like other negative reviews are far more in depth and better explained than this bottom line is done buy this game unless you've done a lot of research before hand
for a while since closed beta actually clocked roughly one thousands hours before playing on steam and the first few hundred hours were really fun however the game in its current state int very comparable to what it was back then at its core its a fun game great mechanics perfect idea for characters sadly its in the wrong hands hire went heavy on the cosmetics element after six years of development they are still unable to release even a single patch that int in need of some serious hot fixing afterwards when bugs do get reported it can take another year before they get fixed saw one take nearly a year and a half to get fixed if you intend to collect skins and whatnot and done care about past content so you just want to collect everything new from the point you start playing then be prepared to spend one hundred and seventy five a year cause that the price you'll pay nowadays just to make sure you've got all the limited items released in that year so yeah if somehow you absolutely done care about any of that or matchmaking or a rude player base then sure i could recommend it around one hundred mythological beings to have fun with but if you re concerned about any of the previously mentioned issues or you re only getting in hoping it will get better give it a pass and a hard one at that its getting worse as the years progress
early access review this game is just the best free to play game i can find on steam what i like about this game one you can buy skins if a want five modes three custom matches with friends or other players less hackers then a think clans its just counter strike go but then with better graphics and you done have to buy this game
early access review about that game hello guys go push together to rusty what sorry ipod rusk what you me apo rusty maybe a hour ska i dec toy mat ebay landon wait i done undersea you a hour you pee dos ska i dec
done want to play hardcore mobs like laugh out loud or data well i highly recommend you this game just for the arena game mode an arena match is just about skill and how you play both teams levels have almost the same level not more than two levels higher besides this fun game mode the game controls are pretty good the single game mode that i played besides arena was joust match with one lane and a jungle
sack of game you lose connection in a game and you lose even if the game hast even started and you re just selecting your towers in the lobby done waste money buying medallions because you lose any medallions you make to losing connection even though its a problem on the games side not the people a moment later and you can start a new game and suddenly the lost connection thing doesn't happen lost all my remaining medallions to this done bother trying to play a battle arena unless you have a the amount of what the entry price is
this game is worth your time its fun and can keep you playing for a long time its perfect for multitasking because you could be watching a video doing homework or whatever and still play this game on the side i original played this game on the bethesda launcher during beta and it was fun i only stopped so i could play the game on steam this game is a must if you love the elder scrolls series the only thing this game is missing is nothing is in not a fanboy and not everything by bethesda is perfect aka fallout four not an role playing game dishonoured two bugs so done even start with me this game is actually good also remember that all the people hating on this game are people who are hearthstone fanboys just look at the bad reviews and look at what they say in them who said that hearthstone can and should be the only card game blizzard did not invent the card game so done listen to them they are logical and are mental stuck in crazy fanboy mode
i have uninstalled this game after updated i have expected to upgrade some mechanics of the game but looks like never changed maybe it can be worse than original like as interface maybe i can play in future but not now sorry bethesda and newly spark pants
early access review this game is like a more item based ssh worth trying if you play smash elsewhere but its a bit slower than ssh yet still faster than brawl the main items are weapons that you pick up from the ground you can throw these if you want but its like having a beam saver from smash the neutral specials are the only unique moves on most characters at the moment there are four or so characters that have six specials the rest just have two when unarmed everyone has the same move set as well there a donor coin shop but if you buy the game then you start with enough for a couple skins overall this is a great game with more greatness to come just gotta hope that no big companies buy it if you like ssh project a and melee grab this if you re a melee purist well sucks to be you old no old for you
i had over three thousand hours in this game by the time i one hundred completed the achievements some were boring some were tedious but generally they were all enjoyed the game has regular events and weekly free golden chests to help with gear and other resources as far as clicker games goes this is an incredible one easily remarkable as the first of its kind no actual money is needed as long as your willing to invest the time effort and patience you can play this game without investing a cent there are a few downloadable content content for this game that adds character specific gear which is a nice add on to invest in but it int a must
a i a at this price id prefer pm plane and other stuff digital combat simulator is a long time almost empty servers those servers that are still working are lacking players and mostly a are up in the skies just to finish off casual targets like a stationary trucks or a free flight maybe even with no weapons it was fun back in time but now this game is obsolete i own like ninety five of docs and i can say that most of them are good only for a free flight what a wanna fight sushi us twenty seven on saver good luck a time to say goodbye
pretty much everyone hates this game because of the pay to win pets and weapon purchasing but the community is also god awful i have a lot more than eight hundred and fort one hours on this game because i played it in web browser for a good chunk of time i enjoyed the game for a very long time and it was fun if you are into very grind games that actually have consequences for dying then you will probably enjoy this game the learning curve int too steep for most of the game it just takes a lot of practice and grinding
early access review it int fair to review most mos after just ten hours but this game is an exception though there is a major benefit to being able to play a game on your computer and pick up the same one on your phone the negatives outweigh the positives as a kid i loved artie entertainment games which focused on style and simple game play mechanics over a hardcore experience however this game just doesn't work with their formula why its an absolute grind fest with too much attempt at being a larger scale massively multiplayer online than their previous game i am more than half way through the game and so far not a single minute has been fun nearly ninety of all quests which are needed to level are kill this fetch that with uninteresting combat that the developers tried to cover up by making it more difficult to survive more than one mob at a time my question is if this was the goal why not just make a worlds mobile especially with all the upcoming popular eastern mos coming to mobile platforms its a game not necessarily lacking in features but in quality at its core would not suggest
i played for about an hour first deer appears at the fort five minute mark guess what its a female i done have a license to hunt female white tail said whatever aimed at it anyways point click nothing misfire apparently this simulator has a no kill what you cant legally kill policy i thought maybe i would be fined or lose some funds but no just wont let me shoot it rep boring as hell if i wanted to really wait that long i would be outside not on a personal computer gam
early access review its all about shooting and a bit of teamwork so it would be a good game if the hackers got banned or something like that bow not bad six hundred and ninety six thousand nine hundred and sixty nine first person shooter on como or free meet center
early access review recent update made things horrid new players are going to be screwed for battle and money income is now ring trash cycling hope you like spending real game money for random loot that is not cosmetic because you will probably get either basic blocks or cosmetics
if you have an inkling of interest in games like the battlefield series but wish that the scale was bigger that the game was entirely persistent and that you as an individual as a squad or even as an entire team had an impact on the game as a whole then planet side two is for you as an massively multiplayer online planet side two delivers an experience that is as social and long lasting as some of the bigger names in the massively multiplayer online market like world of war craft eve online and final fantasy xiv online as an first person shooter planet side two draws the most well loved mechanics from heavy hitting genre hangers like battlefield halo and call of duty four modern warfare this game is absolutely unique when it comes to the gaming landscape only truly comparable to the original planet side and the playstation three exclusive mag both of which were far smaller and less feature rich than planet side over the past two years planet side two has seen numerous updates these range from new weapons vehicles and gear to entirely new continents reworkings of existing continents and mechanics which change the very foundation of how the game works such as the lattice update and the large scale continental lattice the game has even been optimized to run much better than it did in the alpha and beta stages of development through the operation make faster game or mfg series of patches sony online entertainment planet side a developers have always had an open ear toward the community accepting feedback and tweaking the game according to the majority opinion as well as implementing player made items through the in game store see even displays the games official road map on their website allowing players to view the games update schedule as well as voting individual updates up and down and giving feedback on said updates thus giving the developers an idea of what the community wants to see in the game i mentioned an in game store this may lead you to believe that this game is slanted in favor of paying players this is mostly untrue every player has access to every game changing piece of gear in the game the only things that are exclusive to customers who use the games premium currency station cash scare cosmetic items camouflage decals vehicle horns it center and consumables which increase the players multiplier at which they earn experience players can also elect to subscribe to the games subscription model earning themselves a persistent experience boost which lasts until the subscription ends five hundred so per every month subscribed and priority in the queue to warp to an already full continent once a slot is available fortunately the game is entirely enjoyable without any premium benefits and most players are perfectly happy having not spent a single cent in the in game store in the end all you would be paying for is minor convenience rather than game breaking premium exclusives planet side two has quickly become one of the best games live ever played and i encourage anyone who has even a slight interest in the concept of an mops to give it a shot mAy
honestly els word is a great game its just the community that trash one issue in been having is i cannot seem to be able to load up pc via steam which is unfortunate because in added the funds to my steam wallet specifically to load up i cant return from wallet to my debit so this game kinda screwed me over in that sense plus fix the
i love this game especially when there are events and bonus experience points recommended to all of my friends some of that started to play my favourite heroes are supports who are fuckers and pushers i highly recommend this game to people of different types for tank natures for passive and for aggressive players for those who love strategy and enjoy team fights
entertaining but mostly a copy of monopoly has same good element which is destroyed by use of coin based change option lose of connection ruined a few game just use the coin for high reward game dice roll are so fix so game is entertaining and encourage coin us which is waist of coins
product received for free what a great game this is dude good connections and balanced classes best first person shooter game ever dude back back back back back you would think that by now they would have removed the pro
early access review although battle royal games are unskilled boring and they re just becoming popular for some reason this game is funnier than any battle royal games out there limo its got wei and wii simple weapons without any complicated attachments and scopes just two or three so far the only drawback is shooting which is sometimes frustrating hope they'll keep updating it
this game is awesome it may seem cute and not scary but trust me its scary of the first fifty rooms are just cute but from room sixty it will just get more and more scary this is a really great horror game and also it is free i really think you should give this game a shot if you like to be spooked if you do not wish to get really scared i suggest you do not play this game the first specimen is cute but the rest are really scary and also they will try to kill you and hunt you like i said awesome horror game if you want a cute game this is not what you are looking for May
i played trove for first time on someday around two thousand and fifteen i loved that game my main class was a neon ninja that i levelled up greatly and had good equipment some days later i buyer a gunslinger class just to test it int give it much attentions i kept playing some time after my personal computer broke and then it was just a pile of scrap this year i got a new pc and remembered me playing troves i wanted to download it again when i did the launcher was just the same and everything except that when i spawned in the hub was instead using the gunslinger class checked the classes men and my neon ninja want there it was deleted and every in class were worth credit credits you have to get with your in money can still remember back on twenty fifteen when you just needed the crappy gold coins to buy on it was fez pm so after calming my anger down i checked the store to see the daily free and like nine of the i think ten things there were was things worth a ton of money and pray for the daily free thing i cant remember its name to not become a payable because knowing trio they are capable of doing that i posted the request to get my neon ninja back on the glyph help center and i created it over two hour ago and still no response and even on this personal computer counter strike go runs at acceptable fps but this game it crashes every second for no reason apparently after all ont get me wrong rove has an amazing game concept but trio ruined it all they just done care about us or the game quality pamela not graphical anymore
so far my experience with this game has been a disaster i have a great internet connection and yet some how i am having trouble connecting to their servers i got to sign the terms of service agreement three times because of this connection issue with their servers i also got to play the tutorial three times because after completing the tutorial you go the loading screen but here is the good part when you finish the tutorial the game crashes doesn't that sound like fun when this crash occurs you done get a checkpoint or save to say you completed the tutorial i mean that makes too much sense instead after you bring the game back up from its sudden crash you get to play the tutorial again and listen to the pcs jabber on about the same bullshit great first impression grey box
dec games saved my life in the year event twelve there was a young lad who had taken on his first role playing game this wonderful game was called realm of the mad god he loved the game with all his heart by age nine he had logged twelve thousand hours in to the game room was his favourite thing in the world nothing could surpass what kab am had created for him as years passed the young lad spent what felt like an eternity in the realm he played all types of characters and when new ones were created he welcomed them with open arms nothing was closer to his heart than this game suddenly it was the year two thousand and fifteen the boy still played day in and day out for some reason he started to notice less and less content being produced his world was turning grey his days were monotonous shatters after shatters nothing would change sure one day there were a couple turkeys in the realm but that didst interest the boy he just wanted to make realm great again the boys mind was hallow he felt empty inside slowly and slowly he felt less reason to continue his adventure the lava called to him come here its warm in the lava there no need to be out there anymore the lava said and so the boy walked with his trusted speed the boy shed his arm or and walked towards the lava his world full of sadness he noticed the graves around him he was following in the footsteps of his friends and guild members he blended in with the community he followed blindly in their rage with his first foot in already an angel creep out from behind the clouds the angels name was ilex and he said my son this place will be new again you mustn't throw yourself away the boy listened and learned about the world of dec dec was unfamiliar to him yet it felt so close like a gentle mothers touch dec showed him things he couldn't imagine the boy stepped out of the lava with a bright light ilex turned the boys leg to its original form he cast out the world of kab am and the world regained its color to dec
early access review am not sure if i should give this a thumbs up or down its in between for me first off the launch was terrible could not play on the first day and it still has issues with the spas screen witch forces you to restart until you finally get past it takes thirty five restarts if you are unlucky the game looks great and has voice acting in it more then i expected but skills are badly explained and you have to figure it out by trail and error not giving you any real feedback about what the skill does can be really annoying for new players also you as far as i know you cant rearrange the skills how you desire gathering is a pain if you want to craft and gather your own mats you better get ready to spend days looking for the mats you need as for each material node on the map you only get one unit you find iron you get one same for all the other mats i found so far in the game this needs to be reworked else crafting will become a pain at least give us three mats per material node combat right now is rather repetitive as you will most likely use the same skill combo all the time press one then pres two times to compete the combo you can do different once but it does not feel any different i think this game has great potential but it needs some fixes i suggest you wait a while before buying this game to see how things turn out
early access review ranked literally rage quit simulator worse than sta a heists one thousand and ten ign ayin nine hundred and ten game informer wish people would stop with the fake quotes and ratings from our magazine gamester
early access review the difference between players with legendary equipment and those with normal equipment is too great a legendary weapon has double power over the rest and are too easy to find
this game is great live netted about a hours on playstation four and now in switching to personal computer this game is massively multiplayer online role playing game meets dungeon crawling the game is heavily instanced which makes for adaptive environments you can actually seem the impacts you make on the world which gives you a sense of importance there used to be a foundry hopefully their still working on it where you can create your own scenarios and stories and quests that people can experience the level of classic fantasy themed worlds in this game is incredible and the environments mixed with lore books make for quite immersive zones to quest in the dungeons are a little lengthy but the higher level dungeons require puzzle solving that int really that hard but the idea is kinda cool live made so many friends on this game that live gotten at least half of them to join me on personal computer and were going to make a guild together
whilst this game largely depends on experience points grinding to unlock the guns for people wanting to learn about guns or just generally enthusiastic about guns it is a fantastic game it has a wide range of weapons with a feelgood reward for unlocking them a great game and well worth the tiny amount of disc space it takes up
not bad for a free game as someone who played this via both android and personal computer the game is extremely buggy when played on personal computer compared to android issues included audio chopping in and out subpar game mechanics and a major bug that corrupts the save file when the game is closed improperly a a power outage laptop battery dies i invested about twenty hours into my first vault and both my save and backup save were corrupted upon opening the save files all the coding for the save had been wiped with no way to retrieve it so while fun to play in between other games i would not recommend making any in game purchases or playing when there is a chance the game may improperly close may

for being a free to play game its actually really fun you have so much things to do it can get boring at times and could wear you out that due to either wait times to join a game or your plan tank moves slow tank battles can be slow paced at lower ranks but plane battles could go a quicker if you get a good team by your side somethings that annoy me is that the developers like to make russian aircraft super overpowered since the developers are russian as of now i didst have to spend a penny on a thing and i still have the golden eagles that were given to me at the start other than that if you re into historic war games this game is for you
got almost two thousand hours in this game and i can still figure out new ways to play and build the chars i make and that means a lot for a player like me that is all ways trying to figure out something nobody else has done the massiveness of the game and the constant updates from egg makes this game all ways fresh egg has created originality in the sense of there desire to keep inflation out of the game economy which they have done by making every item in the game a currency in itself skills are items you find and use in sockets which means skills is a traceable currency to every skill can get enhanced by support gems you link to them as an example fireball linked with chain making the fireball chain between targets there are a lot of different gems and a lot of different ways to combine pm and deserves a try from all gamers out there you can play this as a casual player or as a hardcore player that desires the competitive scene at the first glance of the skill tree in this game it might seem that you will never learn it but in my opinion it is far from as hard as people make it to be events are being created cunningly to keep the game exciting besides the new leagues that last for longer periods at a time with every new league they create new prices for both the hardcore racers and the casual players that just want to get the achievements or challenges to earn a price path of exile has gotten some criticism for the famous de syncs since the release with the version twenty on the door step egg has made an official statement they are adding a new network model to the game to fix the issue it has caused for some players on a more personal note on that matter i have died to pm myself but over my hours of path of exile i have learned to avoid the de syncs you can cause in the game so for me the de syncs is not a problem anymore but i understand it can be an annoying factor for some players a quote from egg themselves wrap last is a dark brutal continent scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it were sick of the recent trend towards bright cartoony rugs the art style we chose for path of exile is dark gritty and realistic wrap last is terrifying and were tried hard to do it justice in path of exile replay ability is key all world areas including outdoors ones are instanced for your party and randomly generated right down to the magic properties of the monsters that dwell in them and the treasure they guard i could in agree more
early access review okay so live been playing this game for a while i was lucky enough to get into the closed beta and have been playing consistently ever since its very easy to learn got simple controls and simple concepts the characters are balanced really well you can play any character effectively at any level of play its just a matter of skill the game functions around a system where every character has two possible weapons to pick up from the weapon drops these range from a sword to a rocket lance and every weapon has a couple characters that use it the quick attacks on one weapon are the same across every character who can use it but each character has unique heavy attacks with their weapons as well in addition to the weapons there are gadgets that will drop around the stage a bomb a land mine and a spike all dodging is really well implemented and will be important to your play learn to use it and it can be an offensive weapon or a recovery tactic in addition to simply dodging in addition using your dodge in midair performs what is referred to as a gravity cancel which allows you to use your standard notarial attacks while in midair in addition to fighting with the weapons of the character there are melee attacks although there are no unique heavy attacks with the melee fighting this can be very important since throwing your weapons at your opponents can be a very useful strategy and you cant always get back to the weapon to pick it up in time in couch party and custom online matches you can utilize stances which change the stats of your character these are currently not available in ranked play in all methods of play you can use alternate colour schemes which are unlocked by playing with a character these do not provide any change to stats or boosts they are purely visual there is no pay to win playing successfully earns you gold and gold can be used to unlock your favourite characters permanently and a free weekly rotation allows you to practice with a few before finding the ones you like it is possible to pay for mammoth coins which will let you unlock characters faster but they will not do anything to increase the players strength in addition mammoth coins can be used to buy visual changes which cannot be bought by gold but like the colours these changes are purely visual the community at low levels in ranked or in open custom matches can be less than sparkling but once you get to silver in ranked the spammers and the people who will enter matches just to be annoying tend to be weeded away in addition the higher you get in the ranks the nicer the people tend to be in my opinion the best way to play the game is to find some friends and play with them custom online matches can hold up to eight players so you should be set on that front now that all the technical stuff i can think of is out of the way i just gotta gush i really love this game like so much its like if smash bros was better balanced and spamming want a viable way to match skill dodging is smooth and beautiful and so many characters have really cool unique the lore that the deus have put into the characters int exactly important to the game but its fun to read anyways the variety of the characters is amazing and more keep being added its so well balanced that the win rate last i checked between the most successful character and the least was at an average of less than one game its so well put together and so smooth and so fun and i just i really love this game go play it old great game good balance no pay to win go play its fun thank you and good night
early access review it used to be a great game where everyone would mostly be diverse and bring different aspects to a battle that would make them different every time now the weapons are badly mixing with each other getting new items is hard and pointless teamwork is near non existent what rob craft was was truly beautiful this is just a disgrace to as a
early access review how can this game have such a good rating this game is a a a a a movement feels a a a a a there is only ammo not a single weapon only axe and you cant change any options resolution or graphics at all must be troll review
a ridiculous game that prizes itself on completely unbalanced teams there seems to be no discrimination towards experience and vehicle strength example live seen one player slug six shells into an opponent only for the opponent to turn around and one shot them so naturally a complete noon like myself would just be toyed with on every battle field there are steep learning curves and then there is just utter insult to injury just another clear example of how ftp is just pts
i was kinda waiting for this its duel links but on steam instead i really really wish you could skip the duel school i know all of this i wanna be or lillian crowley master of techniques at duel academy i wanna mechanize the melee i want to be the guy that informs you that a turbo is a bit pedestrian as i magically have all that i need to make two tributes give me the ancient gear golem i have an ancient gear deck it does not win often but new support will help tons lemme skip the battle school and get a i go to to increasing the smug but yea if you wanted to duel on steam this is a fine way to do it it gets the job done well enough but done expect to sit down and build your dream deck your dream deck girl will always be better than normal monster beat own and we all know it
early access review would have recommended this game a few months ago before the horrible updates like whf this game is less than half as fun as it was before the game modes get locked and what happened to upgrading your robot how you wanted to now you have the worlds most linear perk chart good game for screwing up your own game no one asked for any of this
i wanna gave a good rating but hell after playing it i int gonna give this game any good review i install the mobile version of this game an it is really fun to play it after the announcement that the game have a personal computer release i install it as soon as i can but boy of boy pro i can play without worrying my phone batteries like seriously this is just a better part of this cameron no maximize button like whf man i cant even see the button on the bottom part of this game only three cards on field seriously man with hard to swipe to switch to studios open like whf you put swipe into personal computer my conclusion is you guys are lazy as heck if you wanna play this game my advice is you better get the mobile version its way more better than this mess
early access review large sprawling battlefields very detailed and impressive amount of customization options levelling skills is done through accolades which helps one tailor their character to their play style vehicle controls are smooth and enjoyable stat buffs can be gained by displaying the appropriate medals this feels rewarding but doesn't necessarily break the game despite micro transactions game play appears agreeably balanced this game places a massive and overwhelming focus on micro transactions everything is for sale at any time and the prices range from moderate to outrageous poor terrain rendering matchmaking often takes an inordinately long time to find a game poor squad system there are some bugs that still need to be ironed outlook proposals big day out community group curator page serious steam reviews sub edit
this game is not bad but can you add something new please like new large map or make a little chance the graft and etc this game is good but it seems like different when we watch the trailer on youtube or your ads hats all what i need to chance or fix
well if you are a new player then maybe you'll like it if you are like me a loyal valve gamer for at least ten years or more i do not recommend this game to anyone any longer now that they messed up the players choice to choose game play modes and server listings are gone this game doesn't suck if you give them money in sure but the four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i paid for the game when it first came out doesn't mean jacks it apparently
the game play is good but not very competitive my greatest issue with the game is the terrible support and the unstable build only usable guides are made by fans extensive issues when even the slightest problem occurs during setup phase i cannot change the res outside of a battle and when i changed inside a battle it caused the game to black screen an issue persisting after restarting the entire game and trying to join a new battle and when i tried to verify game integrity it lacked about six thousands files some of which it couldn't re download due to not having the privilege to gain missing files and i reinstated the game just a an hour ago old decent casual game terrible build and stability
early access review the game had server issues like nearly every single massively multiplayer online role playing game at launch but they took servers down and added more and it was fixed by second maintenance they had some other bugs like the splash screen bug but they addressed it within two days and fixed it they had seriously long queues for some servers but they did a temp lockout on the more populated servers to stabilize them no massively multiplayer online role playing game release is perfect and there always tons of unknowns that occur but be wiz is doing a fine job of handling every curve all thrown their way and making quick fixes their communication could be a bit more frequent but their exec producer did write a well detailed apology letter that explains every single thing that everyone was wondering about and addressed every single issue be wiz earns some respect in my book for the way they re handling this release the game itself is a lot more fun than i expected and in enjoying taking my time to learn the skills and player versus player combos and stopped rushing to fort five since they announced it would be twelve weeks before they add the true end game content to this build overall i definitely have to give it a positive review
currently this game is plagued by hackers and people owning overpowered as hell guns that you need to buy with real cash or grind for like ten years to get them with the in game currency you will not will a single gun fight against people with this gear unless you shoot them in the back using the default weapons so unless you are willing to spend some cash to get some starter packs prepare to get pwned a lot till you'll farm enough crest to buy good weapons
old spawn in kill things die buy new gear repeat nine hundred and ten would buy new horn sounds and cosmetics again continents lock and unlock frequently enough you done have much time to get bored of one or the other occasion bugs but nothing too awful only thing i would like to see added is a cert two do cash conversion system even if it has a low exchange rate however seeing as how its a free to play game i see no problem with helping out a few starving deus and buying some flashy cosmetics edit i bought another horn sound please send my regards to my poor wallet
i am glad i quit the game before putting any money in to the game aside the encode now you need track in to play arcade not to mention that you not only have to pay to win you now pat even to advance because you cant buy a new plane less the previous one is fully upgraded do yourself a favor and try a real fly game
only played for an hour but so far it seems like a solid game will take a fair bit of stuffing around to get force feedback and handling settings dialled in tho why just why done all the other sims sound as good as this i found myself hitting the limiter on purpose just because it sounded so good only down side are the potato visuals bit of a dampener but the incredible sounds make up or it
school of dragons is possibly one of the worst morphs to date remove this garbage off of steam its all pay for this and pay for that and the graphics make me want to shove spoons down my eye sockets
early access review imagine a make a good game people enjoy then a change everything up for the worse and alter core game play mechanics for no reason that realm royal enjoy the meta it will be constantly getting worse and worse every week
game was a blast to play before the latest update seven hundred map is terrible user interface is terrible the stupid are match character screen is a joke like something out of street fighter this game literally went from being fun to i done even want to play it anymore ruined it
its not a bad game if it want for the in your face pay to win like a coin operated cabinet the game does nothing beyond showing you how to pay but not play players bots are just there camping waiting at all times the only cool part i enjoyed was the night time fighting with muzzle flash during combat that it in summary it is like day its more stable and has less dynamic weather more weapons thought and you can jump very oddly in place it plays like a console game and looks like a three hundred and sixty game it is definitely fun with friends who have money prob not for kids as there is text voice chat
path of exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system active skills are not required by levelling up but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like i sorcerer barbarian and melee wizard sure why not corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what i mean these unique settings truly makes combating and looting really fun as a free to play title path of exile is simply huge with its solid game play great graphics comparable to a and unique system anyone interested in hack and slash or role playing game in general should check it out
heed these words for although it is too late for me it may not be too late for you this game is like heroin i want to stop so badly but i just cant the community is awful and the matchmaking makes me want to cry but still i cannot stop get out while you can May
early access review pros it can be good if be wiz listens to the feedback and actually does something cons not polished no where near finished enough to be released optimization is incomplete localization is incomplete and wrong no forty five content there is no endgame content currently available player versus player feels bad ave feels bad story needs help combat system is not fluid if you played any other action massively multiplayer online role playing game you will be disappointed hands down class imbalances
achievements done work screen size int big enough and cant be changed duelling is kinda slow due to annoying and unnecessary dialogue next to no difficulty when it comes to duelling a i player normal game is better cd kenai
in a complete newbie to playing this sort of game and i absolutely love it customising your character their history powers at the start is really cool there lots of scope to upgrade you re weapons abilities as you play for the newbie like myself the in game voiceover help when its time to upgrade a weapon or perform a new move strike is really useful the landscape design is amazing the views scenery are so detailed and helps you to loose yourself in this mystical game i would wholeheartedly recommend never winter whether you re a newbie gamer or seasoned veteran there something for everyone
very fun game although please make it a little bit easier to earn gold silver and experience currently i have an a lee and live been playing for two weeks now so please make it a bit easier thanks for reading my review
early access review spoiler alert this is probably going to be quite a long review so live been with hire since global agenda and i loved every game they made i was a huge fan of a tribes ascend is still in my top five favourite shooters which i play from time to time smite was the game that introduced me to mobs and right now in playing paladins a lot so when realm royal came out i naturally started playing it right away and of boy did it raise some expectations game had a lot of potential and some of its mechanics like class system and crafting based on kills were really fun and cool live played or for a little while deciding to come back when its a bit more polished and finished because it had some glaring issues which was to be expected from early access alpha stage game like cd after like every second match ended and when i come back after a couple of months i find this she so let me count everything they did or didst since the last time live played and live played just one game just now class system got removed that was my first what the fuck seriously hire you literally removed the thing that differed your battle royal from other battle royal games this is one of probably two of your worst decisions ever the second one being stopping any further development of one of the best shooters of its time tribes ascend i could forgive that because smite was pretty good and i switched to other games the weird as fuck new weapon and skill system so basically this problem comes from the first since they removed classes while keeping all the abilities and weapons in the game they had to ballance it out by restricting every existing weapon and ability to a certain slot to avoid overpowered weapon ability combos for the same reason probably number of usable abilities was cut from three two active abilities and one movement ability to two eleven respectively even though its understandable it really kinda blows that i cant use for instance heirloom rifle with a sword like whf three no more legendary weapon crafting in forges another whf hire moment another thing that defined the flow of game play before if you got luck outplayed someone and killed someone you could get yourself a shiny legendary class weapon and had a much better chance at winning the game all while risking a lot to farm shards and spending time at forges getting ambushed surrounded in them a lot of fights were around forges now why would i even use them four amount of loot this is a short one but amount of loot found has been brought down to like five thousand and sixty of what it was at best in the game i played i searched a whole town and not a small one about seventy eight houses and got literally two weapons one ability and about fifteen shards i done count potions and those weird chicken things as important loot and yes i know potions are important that not the point its literally impossible to farm enough shards to forge something especially if you re playing with a squad which actually brings me to my next point man squad restricted game play seriously just why this game already had solo duo play and now its ranked solo duo coming soon whf what if i done want ranked i mean of this could get changed anytime i guess since this is alpha but being locked at man squad game play when you re playing solo ninety five of the time is a bikini it aggravating the cts didst get fixed like literally i played one round and the game cts after it finished old the game was in a really good shape right after its early alpha release but hire for god knows what reason plunged this game into a stole right now its a cluster cd of all weapons abilities that it had before all while still poorly balanced with a lot of questionable decisions made about core game mechanics big bug crashes still there change core she back before its too late hire done mess with core mechanics this was supposed to be a class based battle royal if by any chance hire is reading this listen i am your long time fan live played your every game since global agenda and right now you re making second of your biggest mistakes ahem star developing tribes again ahem please revert those stupid changes just make it as it was add some freaking skins make the map bigger and fix some bugs ads and this will be a wonderful game done do this to yourselves
early access review this game is just awesome i done know what it is about it when you go in you see the cutesy side of it and you think no biggie but it is a very eerie and creepy game i love this totally recommended
early access review its a good and fair game probably has the best returns for investments of any of the digital tags floating around on the market you get a lot of stuff for just investing a minimum amount of time also the most interesting features gauntlet forge and draft are fairly accessible a few games and gauntlet runs here and there will keep you with a constant flow of in game currency which allows you to participate in all of them so why am i giving this a thumbs down there is one major game breaking element in here ring its a mess in this game literally the only reason of ninety why i lose games is either getting man screwed or getting flooded even with an absolutely decent mana base and fixing etching its frustrating its pure randomness and although we cant avoid this in in real life tags it should be avoided in digital games as it doesn't add anything but frustration if you are running a decent mana base the ring shouldn't be the deciding factor in games like this its frustrating to lose to it and its also no fun to win because your enemy got screwed or flooded it should be skill and dec building that is deciding digital tags not randomness and live lost too many times to utter randomness in this game to give it a thumbs up still its a decent and fair game most of the time and has probably the best rewards system of all the digital tags out there
early access review so i started playing this game about a week ago absolutely loved it its important to note that i usually hate battle royal games but not this game this game took emphasis on past tense all the things i hated about the battle royal genre and threw them out the window it was color full without being min craft it want a camping simulator and the run in this game was limited you were encouraged no required to fight if you wanted to have a good chance at winning the best weapons and equipment didst randomly drop somewhere you had to craft them at a forge crafting them also required an in game trophies you only got from killing another player this and the fact that you got a reward shards which are what you need to craft things at a forge in general whenever you killed another player made sure that people weren't just hiding somewhere but actually seeking fights because fights were encouraged and they were worth taking the risk people couldn't just drop somewhere far off loot everything and then camp that is until a few days ago ignoring every bit of community feedback the developers of this game decided to take everything that made this game stand out and unique and good and threw it out the window its the same ring infested camping simulator that punishes seeking fights now that every other battle royal game already is too you can find dozens of similar games now with the only difference between them and this game being that they are less color full and their developers probably done ignore the feedback from their community unlike this game
early access review if you re tired of hearthstone and want something more challenging and less ring dependant this is the perfect game for you mtg players should feel right at home with this one one of the game designers is lev
early access review this is really scary i mean i warning can cause epilepsy diarrhoea eye bags and heart attack first of all i give my respect of the creator of this game you have created one of the most cut scary game in the steam its concept art is great you can feel its horror when playing it each level have its different structure and going further and further it gets harder and more scarier art i really tell you its amazing from cuteness to horrifying sound when going to a different room its sound effects changes i really like that character voice i haven heard other character voice except the ghost girl well its pretty good horror eight thousand nine hundred and ten medium rating popup only gets me scared well sometimes the chasers too gets me xii really appreciate if you would add more chasers that would get you heart more pumping
combat is stale classes are stale customization is alright aids are stale community is full of kids repetitive and unrewarding at high levels bad combo gear rarity is de common is common uncommon is common rare is common epic is common legendary is common shadow is uncommon rainbow is uncommon the only good thing is the building
early access review its like if magic and hearthstone had a baby and that baby grew up to be chuck norris but in collectible card game form you can actually build control decks in this game without being rich cough hearthstone cough magic the gathering
most of my playtime belongs to the downloading patching from the three times i have tried this game and every time i find it substandard and dreary we must ignore the pay to win for it was foretold in the prophecy
i loved this game until the last update now the game is broken clicking becomes literally useless early game your powers once you unlock them are based on clicking power so also useless right from the start since clicking is already trivial when you get those some upgrades are bugged in game bonuses are now so rare and worthless you done even want to pay attention to the game anymore to get those the developers took a great entertaining and addicting game and made it a frustrating and annoying game until they fix this if they do fix it i do not recommend the game to anyone
early access review obviously with reading the reviews you can see that free am took a good game and ruined it to make it a terrible badly made pay town game its true but its free what a expect if it costed money they make no money they done deserve being on steam
take a name associated with the most faithful adaptations of do rules to personal computer games throw out all the customization that made those great and you re left with this button mashing money grabbing hack slash massively multiplayer online piece of garbage
early access review this game is fun with a very supporting community online its one of the few games where it actually takes a long time and dedication to get the many powerful weapons so farming for items will be one of your main points into getting stronger in the game this game is great but sometimes its hard to discern if the items you re using is actually affecting the enemy because the stat differences a rent that large dealt eighty nine damage to an enemy with a weapon with fifteen attack did the same amount of damage with a weapon with around twenty nine attack overall i found this game pretty fun
i doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try team fortress two especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag but i suppose i should throw my two cents in anyway team fortress two is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play you get nine classes to toy with each having an interesting personality and a unique play style then as you play you'll come across weapons that let you experiment within each class play style the more you play the more stuff you amass and the more options you'll have at your disposal if you haven already take a dip into the world of team fortress two you re almost guaranteed to find something you like
early access review eternal sits in between magic the gathering and hearthstone it could use some polishing but in sure the team is on it this game can be huge if the deus keep improving it i highly recommend it
live allot of hours logged into this game and roughly almost every dragon in this game there pros can cons of this game for one it costs money to unlock areas and get better items and dragons unless you've at least three boulder dragons for stable quests near titan level its almost impossible to raise gems without real life cash getting involved as well the membership for this game int worth the buy whatsoever done pay for membership for this game ever for three thousand and sixty one can easily buy the whole game via area buy with gems and a couple dragon egg chests as well while the membership costs around ten monthly and there at the moment no way of cancelling your membership with a one click system so it will continue to take money off even if you done want it too unless you create a forum page and actually spend the time to write back and forth to a admin int a admin for the game but just gives the info to another admin so it literally takes about a week to cancel a membership a normal kid will have no idea how to do this in my honest opinion and the game is cup intense instead of gnu intense there no way to change the graphic settings they re permanent locked at one setting and your cup will do almost everything for the game instead of say your dedicated graphics carded glitches upon glitches in the hrs live played this game live gotten locked out of my main viking at least three times for several weeks and i had to go though forum admins and normal admins several times to get back into the viking and at one point no one in the world could age up a dragon because there was a huge no age glitch unless you used gems to age them it was impossible and it want fixed for a two week time period and there tons of more glitches in this game that a rent noticeable tell they effect your game play for example the telescope glitch that wont let one click on the telescope on the ice island that hast been fixed in around a year so then you've to do around twenty quests to be able to finish it and click on the telescope in berk to finish the quest on the ice island i done recommend this game for children for these reasons i only played it for so long because i love how to train your dragon so much and own all the books and to series and movies
rob craft was once a really fun game however the deus have taken so many of the most fun parts of the game out that its just a huge grind done play rob craft the deus will always take the best part out edit if i lose connection in game why cant i rejoin i didst lose internet connection just my connection to the server and when i regained connection there was no way for me to rejoin
when you have a hours nearly one thousand us spent on a game you assume when an issue prevents you from logging in the support team would handle it quickly its been two weeks since my support ticket has been open and its still not resolved trio is known for their poor support system now i know first hand
early access review well here i am this was my favourite game played for hours a day and thought about it through school now i hate clicking the play button this went from great to meh to burn it with fire i must say i was happy when the game updated but then when the release came out for new items it would be a to bloody expensive a the high their pros can only get it and done even get started on the economy way back then it was great smooth economy things can be affordable with twenty five battles and getting good was at the good point where its hard and takes work but then when you get their you feel rewarded now the lower tears must be faced king themselves with how greedy these people are what happens every update it feels like the prices grew higher and the money earned went down or didst go as high as the prices did i spent weeks trying to get three be mega hovers weeks weeks for crying out loud weeks to make it a challenge said the mods such a challenge to get them it took me a shorter time to get through to the hardest their for me to get through than to get three bloody mega hovers back to updates it was easy to get into updates and other things related to rob craft new update coming soon may i would think as it went on and on it was new update with new weapons and a new map first time in for a new map in a looking go time what was i like meh very excited removing enable cash from battles without selling was rob craft shooting itself in the leg that bleeding like hell from the other times it shot itself in the leg and never fixed it i liked the crates idea at first but when i saw that the upper row requires premium to get those items i had a brain fart another thing to add onto the list of greedy things free am has done holy i never knew how much nursing free am would do to weapons that weren't one of the newer weapons newer weapons such as the missile launcher anti air proton launcher and things that came after that to make it not any longer i just want to say this game was once good but now it has gone down the drain i feel like it can no longer be saved i guess it cant be saved goodbye rob craft our times once were fun and enjoyable billy oboe
early access review if planet side two and war thunder had a love child in space this would be it really fun its already really good even at this stage of development needs a ship modifier mode though where you can add more gun or arm or or something that makes your ship stands out and stronger cant wait to play the full game where its less saggy and smoother a
the game is okay i guess its good yeah sure but the game itself has no color no life looks so dead boring and colourless two hours into it i feel so tired already doesn't happen to morphs i like try it and see for yourself if you like it then good for you if not well yeah i feel a again its a good game but it feels so lifeless so i had to drop it ill give it a cheers
early access review everyone who says it has malware is a dumb ass and if seeding is a problem for you not only can it be disabled with one click you re a the game itself is wonderful and a blast to play the gunplay is great and the mechanics are nice it has vehicles and the bunny shoes are hilarious fun i done know at how anyone could not like this game unless you re not a fan of battle royals
best way to play this is to look straight to the ground and take off headphones except when doing the audio cue puzzles game is okay gets actually spooky around the one hundredth room its an okay game
when i first started playing this game which i found by accident i thought it was a bit too annoying for my taste but once you start remembering all the parts for individual weapons you feel some sort of accomplishment when you correctly complete a gun with seventy parts without mistakes within a certain time if you get this game its free so why wouldn't you you will need to take into account that you cannot expect to complete this overnight unless you pay thirty for the full unlocks you could complete three or four weapons within the first day but after that the experience costs of weapons starts to rise and as repeating games nets you only ten of the experience you will have to count on gaining most experience through quiz every two hours and daily rewards some bad things about this game would be you require ten friends who play to unlock shooting ranges invite five friends who done play and get them to play the game for an achievement and experience and that really it
great concept great game and great game play one concern which is evident as many players probably know already is that the games player base is rapidly declining as off now huge large scale battles are scarce and seldom quite saddens me as i remember when i played it long ago these were common
early access review baby first world of war craft no but seriously this would make my twelve year old self very happy in nineteen now in never happy anymore recommend only if you re of with this game still being in beta or you re still a teenager but if you re never happy anymore you wont enjoy it ill still give it a recommend to the younger player base
just as good as i remember the original being huge open worlds and battles full of hundreds of players its the only true massively multiplayer online first person shooter that i can think of at the moment lot of vehicles ground and air along with ground troops in open battle is an amazing experience its quite difficult when you begin you'll be thrown into battle with hundreds of players both experienced players and those just starting out you will die a lot just done get discouraged continuing playing stick with large groups and you'll slowly get the hang of the mass warfare
only had this game for two days but really enjoying it the tutorial does a very good job of leading you through the controls and how to play the game and the three starter ships you begin with are no less capable than any of the other ships they just have roles which make them easier to play detection capable scout used in tutorial a fast attack ship and a support ship with healing are pulse and ability to break enemy armour all the ships in game are able to be obtained without spending real money and the rate at which you can earn them seems pretty quick there are multiple ships at relatively low cost across a range of roles including a very tank battleship a medic ship with healing beams a cloak ambushed it center the ships for the more complex roles will take a bit of time to work towards but that probably a good thing as it means by the time you can buy one you've probably worked out how it could be used
this game has got to have one of the worst tutorial modes i have experienced so far i have been doing the tutorial and campaigns for two hours now and i still done know how many of the mechanics work the tutorial itself feels thrown together and not planned out the story they try to tell you sounds boring and i personally would have preferred the game to not tell you any of those pictured stories at all or at least provide proper narration since the voice acting cant even remotely compare to that of hearthstone instead of telling you straight up what the actual battle phases are and what you can or can not do they make you go through the trouble of only being able to use the highlighted cards even though you can play other cards in the actual game mode sometimes you are allowed to play cards before attacking sometimes you are not but they wont tell you why that is the individual card skills are not explained properly and i personally struggle a lot because the voiceover itself is in english while i am forced to play the game with german sub flavour texts as there is no option of using english only or german only neither in the game settings nor in the steam settings this makes any sort of immersion into the game extremely difficult the language settings thing is more of a complaint towards steam though and not so much to eternal as i have the same problems when playing the pitcher and some other games i do hope that they will release the english language pack for other countries though anyways i have played hearthstone since beta and enjoyed it until a year ago when i quit because of the greedy blizzard ecosystem where you either pay up or play mindless aggro decks i also used to play lots of yugo and some mtg when i was little and some gwent after i quit hearthstone yet i am still having trouble with the eternal rule sets because of their badly thought out tutorial system i decided that i will give it another two hours or so of playtime and see if the experience changes somewhat or stays the same i must say so far i am rather disappointed i get that the game itself is supposed to offer more depth than hearthstone while not being as deep as mtg but shouldn't they at least have given you a smooth start into the game instead of forcing you to play only highlighted card for an hour while barely explaining the mechanics or at least which mechanic triggers first so far i am everything else but impressed with the game it has some good core mechanics but somehow feels way too rushed out like they needed another month or two to polish it up properly
early access review finally eternal card game is the game wizards of the coast should have created ten years ago had wizards created an accessible attractive and intuitive oct based on mtg they would be the dominant player in the market going on a decade now however their shortsightedness and unwillingness to experiment with their in means we had to wait for eternal to scratch our magic itch hex while a beautiful and intricate game lacks the accessible and intuitive aspects that hearthstone and eternal meet the game play in eternal is rock solid taking core collectible card game mechanics and tying them to color similar to mtg currently the color are not as stratified as mtg which allows for more versatile single color decks while offering expanded options for multicoloured decks eternal after my ten hours of play or so so take it with a grain of salt seems less focused on defining the met game itself unlike hearthstone and to some extent mtg where the meta minus minor tweaking is established within days of a new set coming out largely by the developer this is for two reasons the core mechanics introduced in hearthstone expansions are usually the most efficient jades single copy bombs like reno and kazakhs it center and the limited card pool simply doesn't allow much experimentation although in just starting with eternal it appears that there is a decent range of creature removal larger creatures and the like in each color along with some strong but not forced themes like echo and void play while eternal has a mana mechanic it is automated this means the game sets your mana curve for you limiting your optimal mana ratios however i assume they did it to remove complexity from dec building which is a good thing when trying to bring in more casual players the game offers a plethora of man fixing cards as well in both colourless and coloured cards to allow better control of your mana low so far live only been man hosed on a couple of occasions in most games mana has tended to be plentiful often to the point of excess as my early games tend to go long while i build my collection and create more efficient decks eternal thankfully does away with the tiny card packs of hearthstone and hex and has twelve cards per pack very close to the fourteen minus the land in a mtg pack at pack not counting the ability to draft gauntlet or forge for free card dust the pack size value ratio is exceptional compared to hex mtg and hearthstone currently the game modes available are gauntlet forge ranked and draft as someone who likes to play mostly solo as i build a collection the game modes are very close to perfect gauntlet is a free ave constructed tournament mode and can be used to grind gold and some usually common or uncommon cards with a perfect win record earning a card pack as well the artificial intelligence modes seem well designed to offer players good rewards as the player base could probably not accommodate player versus player in each forge is eternal arena a sealed deck format where you build a deck from random sets of three cards again the game assigns your mana it appears though live only played once but did get a perfect seven wins that once you have chosen two color of cards all remaining picks are of those two color this is a very nice feature and prevents someone from getting pretty far off track into five color though i am certain there are some who would actually like that arenas cost twenty five hundreds gold to enter the win run earned me thirty five hundreds gold a couple of cards and four card packs so a little more than thirty one value you are allowed two losses before your run ends as you are playing an artificial intelligence it seems this mode offers a pretty fair chance to hit seven wins if you are good at sealed in cogs if the decks the artificial intelligence is playing done get more challenging as you rank up in forge it should be pretty easy to go infinite live only played a few games of ranked just enough to get a win for a quest as i doubt in prepared to face constructed decks quite yet the mode works fine and even with only about two thousand players online at any time the matchmaking only took a little longer than hearthstone the casual mode is currently offline i am guessing until a larger player base means it wont cause extended queue times i haven drafted yet but i will update my review when i do overall eternal is a great entry to the crowded online collectible card game market and outside of hearthstone might be the one to succeed with players who want something a little deeper than blizzards game the nitpicks i have with the game are minor i think the art looks a little small on the play table and in on a twenty seven monitor though it is fine when zoomed in as a once longtime competitive magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness i prefer a hearthstone style consistently building mana pool however its not a game breaker and i haven noticed it being as much of a problem as i had in my it qualifier days if you are a magic player that wants deeper mechanics but still slicked up hearthstone style experience eternal is your game
early access reviews force truly is a work of art i done mean that lightly the way its animated plus its music gives it that title in my book i can find myself playing one level for an hour maybe even hours at a time the frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music the way the levels are crafted is truly mind blowing they had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key and you would use that key to earn more levels in layman terms to earn more levels you had to perfect current levels they ditched that and added an experience points system in which you gain more experience points to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect in very glad they added this system and was sceptical about buying it but now that i did buy it i do not regret it even for a second one thing i really love about this game is how you done have to unlock base levels in a sense this game is open world that sense is that many levels are available to you and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels or stay where you re at to get an a in completion you have to sweep up every leaf and to get an a in finesse you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level another thing i absolutely enjoy about dust force is its expansive community there are lots of community workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on and lots of people who can set a good example in sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a youtube channel so you can probably catch them there the community may or not be active but it sure is good and friendly overall in terms of game play music art style animation and difficulty its not an easy game but its not that hard of a game either it just depends on how much you want to play it i rate this game buy this game may
school of dragons resembles something of king isle entertainments creations wizards or something of the sort so if you re familiar with games such as that you can expect this to be quite the same the game appears to attempt to tell its own story your story whilst still adhering to the story of the original movie the graphics and player mobility of the game are subpar although the map layout is phenomenal the game int as bad as other reviews might suggest its a free game so there no harm in surveying it i done see myself playing this game for an extended period of time as it is not my cup of tea regardless of that the player count for this game is phenomenal for the amount of negative reviews this game has undertaken
well made but like every other clicker game it gets boring after a while it depends on how you like those kinda games i like games kinda like cookie clickers but in other terms this game want for me but other wise its a great game if you done like crafting clicking type of games
its really insulting for there to be a premium subscription system in this game and heres why starts off innocent enough right you pay your five bucks and start playing and level up your herat the end of the month your subscription ends what happens to that hero progression you committed hours to does it vanish does all that hard work need a monthly renewal to be retained after you level up if it doesn't vanish what happens on the flip side remember that one time you played that one ransomed hero you done ever usually play and levelled him to a really really low rank the meta will change and maybe you'll pick that hero more and more in the future but now whenever you replay him people will see that lowly rank forever after the subscription expires you'll get flamed shamed and pressured into renewing a subscription just so you can validate yourself as a data player valve understands its toxic community i have no doubt they re trying to leverage the harassment that will surely ensue in pubs whether you done have a pass or didst renew it why do i need to pay to validate to others that i am a good data player all of these new features could have easily come standard to everyone all of this plus i can see a future now where they'll lock further and further content behind this pay all everything from now on will be locked to people who choose to play for free the games population has reached its peak now they re holding us in with a subscription system that well need to commit to with our wallets i protest this system with my wallet i will never again buy a compendium again cash cow of a game and they re still not satisfied game you re getting too fat you cant see the players who used to respect you and grovel at your feet over your triple chin and mountainous belly anymore
way too many bothers and cheaters you ban people for using cheats that you catch but what about all those people obviously chat spamming at the nexus i watched people in the wilderness shoot thru walls clip thru walls and otherwise break the rules yet none of them have been banned yet i think the development team needs to take a look at this notorious oryx rape client and learn how to defend against it to anyone thinking of playing save yourself the time and download something else this will just test your patience and reveal how mad you truly are on the inside maybe that how its supposed to work my rating the game concept is cool but they need to refactor nearly everything especially the part where you need to pay real money to pretty much do anything because you will never get there legit being pushed out by bothers and spammers and i cant wait for the responses saying of well just mute the spammers gee thanks never thought of that there are more spammers in this game than any one person can count to in a lifetime so yeah not recommended
early access review if you are a huge fan of smash bros this game is for you its a fun amazing plat former game i usually done play plat former games but this game has sucked me in i am a huge fan of this game and i love playing it it is based on skill there is no pay to win or pay to play at all its a fun amazing game
stay calm stay calm ohio again this game is just hardcore you have to level up to get stronger but if you die you have to start over again you have to be very careful in this game but on the other site you should get better weapons and arm or so you can survive a lot easier later you have to farm some dungeons or mobs to get stat pots which increase your stats you can trade join guilds or cry because you lost another character it is real challenging but a lot of fun if you are a patient person you can unlock a lot of classes and decide if you want to play a healer damage dealer or tank there are even classes which combine two of these roles you should total try it out if you like the retro like graphic and rogue like shoot and dodge games
early access review be not played much of this game so its fair to say that i haven to been able to experience all the features however i already see the aspects of the game which need emphasising and the problems of this game the game is early access so it has the odd bugs a multicoloured polygon games springs to mind but this in to something to get angry about in game before its official release the team working on this is small but the game is often updated as is the outlined plan and community engagement is fantastic from artie entertainment it was the nostalgia of my playing adventure quest worlds almost ten years ago that drew me to this game it has some of the same charm and humour but not to the same extent at times the game can feel like its trying to hard to be what its predecessor was the big question when it comes to this game is whether trying to make the game accessible for mobile gamers had limited its appeal and enjoyment for personal computer gamers the answer in short is yes the camera feels clunky and the game very much feels like its designed for regular visits and clicking which could be done on a small screen the classic trope of mos grinding quests are definitely frequent toward the point of tediousness some redesign is definitely needed in terms of quest placements and objectives my main suggestion in this field would be to drop about half the quests often quests are very small possibly to make it them computable on the move and so double the rewards for the remainder with a slight increase in difficulty i think its more important to feel a sense of accomplish in terms of achievements rather than in gear the game does to feel like a life experience in the same way as other some mos and rugs including adventure quest worlds does but more like the repetitive formula of a grind for gear rather than a quest to accomplish a task thus the problem is that the game feels far too much like a classic massively multiplayer online and not enough like the game it could be perhaps essentially what is needed is a slightly altered three dimensional version of the of artie a more successful two dimensional games another problem is the crafting system when you collect enough raw material pc crafting shops can make this into gear for a price this is quite basic and nothing i really have a problem with the issue lies in the need to wait a set about of time a minute an hour a day it center in order to collect your new gear it slows the game and when you collect the item it can sometimes be that it no longer feels worth the time as you be levelled up and found new equipment to use the question that i think it comes down to asking yourself is whether it is better to invest your time in a game mid development or a game in what is essentially the downloadable content phase should you play advent request three dimensional or adventure quest worlds for me getting back into the latter is very daunting with so much content one of the reasons i often avoid mos is because i feel so out of my depth when compared to players who have been around for so much longer the three dimensional game is lacking but it has fantastic potential and will hopefully grew into the game it could be its worth taking the time to try this game before dismissing it especially for people who played artie games some years ago
hire are killing another game most of the competent deus have been moved to paladins and were been left with people who just want to milk the game for cash without fixing any of the problems they flood the game with subpar skins in endless ring payt get chests loot boxes and done fix the bugs live been playing since the closed beta and this is such a shame
early access review this game came out of nowhere for me i haunt seen or heard a jot about it before the recent steam sale overall very much enjoying it the space battles are just the best lots of depth too especially considering its just an alpha overall a cracking game excited to for the full release
old data was fun the new had and the game play is just terrible it seems like they are designing it for the steam machine but it is just brutal now the notifications stack on top of each other so you have no clue what is going on in the game its hell trying to view your teammates inventory or your opponents its just bad now in also uninstalling
its super fun and cross platform between personal computer macintosh android and is which is an awesome way to get your friends to join in the fun its easier to pick up than card games like magic but has very detailed mechanics making it fun to collect and master
game for the war hammer a event left cause of how much play time id have to put in to play with the war hammer tanks in talking days and or spending like one hundred bucks to just get them what a scam
early access review they still have a long long way to go before i would consider this a playable game everything seems to be held together with duct tape its very clunky you cannot adjust any settings and the gunplay feels like more footnote than pub which is sad and awkward when its graphically so similar to pub the biggest reason in uninstalling it right now however is because of the cancer known as foreigner being installed on my personal computer without my permission absolutely unacceptable borderline criminal
early access review have been with rob craft for quite a while and honestly i do not like the direction they are going it used to be a great build and bash that was pretty balanced but it seems like over the updates the balance has gone away pay to win is the name of this game with the recent update no more money from winning matches just random loot crates that you only get half of if you are not a premium user while they do drop free premium every once in a while its not keeping me attached to this game anymore i done think its worth too much more of my time unless some changes are made
meh this game is basically an ask game thank god its free even the time i have spent coming back to it just to level up characters and get to other stages feels as if i have just wasted parts of my life
if you played and or play the normal yugo card game i do not recommend this its a sad imitation done get me wrong its oddly enjoyable i mean i put in six hours into it and if it was bad i would a dropped in with less then thirty minutes but its not something i can take seriously cons first they cut the game in half which means half the deck size half the he half the time and half the cards on the field biggest issue with that is they changed no cards to fit that so that means you have cards the ask for five thousands he and combo cards like exod a that are useless the game forces you through a progression system that treats you as if you have a brain malfunction i understand explaining a game to someone but anything bellow level forty is no challenge at all and that with a half deck to give example of how bad it is level twenty and bellow are so easy i can win with no he loss and can do some stupid combos that are never don as they take to long the artificial intelligence is super simple now that would not be so bad if you have to grind out fight to stage six to even play against players just to clarify what i mean by no challenge is the enemy does not place spell or trap and nothing above crappy regular three stars which can be easily out done with one of your first cards last thing i have to say is that the game reminds me a of stereotypical chinese knockoff they put in a attempt tried to cut corners and it turned out like pro yes i tried too hard to find more then one thing good to say about it matches are fast so you can enjoy a few during a break its more portable so yugo on the go less money to get a insane amount of cards good way to try new cards and card combos they implement a auto duel feature making the boring duels shorter more so if you have the sense to make a decent deck voice actors from the anime
early access review free amazing game and i never had any problem on it until now allot of weapons and characters actually there is something i love it in this game that you done have to pay money mean charge real money for it you can play and level up your account without money and you can buy skins and more weapon if you want but that will not make you stronger something else this game have new game play new technic something different on it last thing that made me impressed they respect players reports and suggestions finally i really recommend this game for everyone try it and see what in talking about
are you stupid why would you be so greedy and kill the dam game makes me sick i have like two hundred and thirty even hours in to this game but will uninstall and will never play again in suck of trio you ruin every game you touch because of greed in not alone i know lots of players that uninstalled cut of this hope your happy greedy tips youth beenynqmziwshttps youth behave by
early access review this is a game where you spam left right click you should not have a suing matchmaking system full of suing try ards overall in a god game just fix or matchmaking a a a a
game first released for mob in best game for mobile yet a playing this game for two yrs now and still i think this game is doing too good since its released first on mob back in i recommend to play on mobile if a have one
early access review this game is actually quite a bit of fun i had previously played both faerie and hearthstone so the game play in egg took a couple games to get used to but it has been well worth it i highly recommend playing this game if you enjoy games of this type
it is fun and truly free to play you cannot buy an advantage you can only buy appearance buying new playable characters is not necessary you can simply get them by playing the game and earning in game currency
why in practise mode do you have significantly decreased economy and why are there cool downs to increase it and also why are you nursing the meta towers to make them bad and not usable killing a big has become almost impossible and so even if the game was balanced it would be excessively boring and nobody would want to play it the whole community is saying to the deus to fix the game and they re doing the exact opposite of what the community wants meaning everybody stops playing the game because its a waste of time please done get this game its horrible
okay very good mob really like it but there always a but not like in butt like in but so like i said but please add set id be really happy if you did it note that maybe its only me that thinks so but not like in butt for fucking sake dirty minded people no but for real please add set and his ultimate should be when he transforms into a huge serpentine that be cool right it boost his damage his speed and his he making him a tank god right please note this
imagine going to a clothing store and giving the employees fifty dollars and saying give me a hat than taking said hat putting it on and then signing up for the military two years later you have been ranked up to a private first class you go out to your one hundred mission with your hat and a lighter then you set the hat on fire instead of taking your gun out you run to the enemy base with the flaming hat and say i will trade you this hat for your car keys then you are shot and die and that the game
access review this was one of the best battle royal games i have seen i would love to recommend it but their privacy policy states that they collect data and in like of okay probably just your system hardware and time spent playing however the more i read the more strange it got like i know cheating breaks and ruins the game but come on that just overkill why would you need to know my antivirus or my network connections its acting like some kinda trojan or something please done get this until they make some major changes to there policy link to policy tips wow ringofelysiumonline come privacy him
early access review what a great game but i feel as if it is incomplete us fans were told about hurricane game play and several modes all we get in the end is a map linear shooter with a limited user interface it seems as if mid development the creators of the game said nah its good enough and left which sucks because it a really fun and addicting game i would say its a six hundred and ten rating but only if you can get past the limited graphics and limited user interface great game but can be improved
early access review howdy exceedingly simple game with a very linear path without any means for debating too simple for a regular gamer too complex for a brand new young gamer to figure out what they must do in order to advance the linear story
early access review good mechanics somewhere between hearthstone plus and mtg lite very generous free to play implementation good fun without screwing the pooch for monetization highly recommended if you re looking for a digital collectible card game
a true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming this sequel to a genre definer that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre great graphics amazing sound and voice design and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make data two great but its major strong point is the depth in its mechanics while dots game play might seem daunting at first its one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting other games such as league of legends end up falling short because their deus decided to cut much from the original formula but data two kept it intact and makes sure you learn something new everyday not only the core game is strong but also the sport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing with several tournaments going on including valves own the international at the time of release the game looks like a train with no brakes about to crash against its competitors and run them over raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game
its free play and definitely has some pay town qualities but if you re a casual player and done care about being it its quite fun and free lots of do lore especially if you've played any of the recent do encounters adventures rules are based on fourth edition which is my favourite edition so far live played dozens of hours before it came to steam levelled a cleric to sixty and have a couple lower level alternatives i only paid once to get the founders pack deal when it first came out in beta there definitely dozens of hours of free entertainment here no map necessary get a group of friends together and play it for fun ave and its totally free
neat the game has been released time for another review dlr normal people don to bother but if you re a masochist this is a game for you the game punishes you at every step of the way for playing the game they do this by requiring you to level everything you own in order to unlock better flat out straight up better equipment and weapons it gets worse they go further by requiring you to pay upkeep costs for your weapons the mods on your weapons and the ammo you fire modded weapons are required and become unreasonably expensive to maintain however if you pay premium you may use them without any draw backs weapons themselves are expensive and nearly impossible to obtain unless you pay money or put in hundreds of hours to grind out the required levels what would otherwise be a decent wii game is weighed down and ruined by this unfair and a fun progression system thank you for reading all this May
excellent game allows for accurate game play with low graphics settings plus its free so anybody who is unable to afford a high performance computer can enjoy this gaming just as much one thousand and ten
this is what an arg should be a company that puts its products and customers ahead of the bottom line that unthinkable in this day and age i am always the first to loathe micro transactions but even i had to admit this is worth it and threw some coins to egg its amazing to see how much depth and game play is here after being a victim of the gradual dumping down of ali over the past few years the first character i made was a pretty big mistake and i started over its actually awesome to be able to make good and bad choices what a nice change of pace so i really recommend this one to everybody my only regret is that i never really gave this game much of a chance before now and before i forget this is one of the only games that i actually leave the music playing in its incredible
early access review it takes a super long time to join a match and half the time when its says connecting it will just throw you back to the lobby the movements are a bit saggy but other than that good game
i know my steam play time is low but live been playing this game for a solid amount of time before this released here and i love it so much this is from someone who hated mobs and everything about them but i was a bit curious and thought that smite seemed like a good entry point and since then this has been the only game i consistently play the gods are all so cool and the mythology adds a fun layer with the characters plus actually seeing the skins you have on your god is pretty great the mod is a fun addition because it spices things up a little if you done want to play a traditional game mode which smite has a solid amount of the daily log in bonus is great because i haven spent a penny on this game and i have a bunch of gods and skins and ward skins and icons if you re someone who doesn't like mobs i would suggest you give this one a try because it might just click for you that all being said it seems the steam version might be a bit iffy right now so you may want to wait and download it from hi re either way i hope you play this game mAy
this is the closest digital replacement to mtg you'll find including the mana system that can sometimes frustrate those who done understand why its there its very good and quite friendly for newbies and people like me who done want to spend money daily quests and free modes like the gauntlet give you enough gold dust to build your collection quickly in completely free to play and after a few months am at the point where i can build top tier decks or easily grind the needed dust for them in a few days my only gripe is that in still so bad at draft to update i finally managed to hit draft master
early access review the game had a rough start as there were a ton of players rushing into the game and the result was a large waiting queue and multiple restarts on the servers fast forward five days and server stability is much better and the game is a lot more fun now the combat system is very unique allowing for a cascade of different combos to choose from and a ton of customization where the chances of even the same class being played exactly the same is very slim i played wow a lot and this game has a better feel for sure i chose the seventy dollar pack and i enjoy the perks that come with it
in my opinion its the best action role playing game that on the market right now it has a grim setting and a story that mostly told through environmental bits of lore but most importantly it has a depth of game play that no other arg comes even close to its the best spiritual successor to diabolo ii to date the first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed there is a web with hundreds of choices done worry eventually it will make sense you can obtain respect points via quests and item drops so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear the gems have one of three colours redbud green that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear sockets can be linked allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems this can do things such as splitting your burning arrow into four projectiles or turning your glacial hammer attack into an are attack that hurts monsters all around you later in the game you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage or get stunned every three months the deus launch a major patch with a new challenge league which adds new skills new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics the free to play model is truly free to play you can play all the content in the game without paying a dime the only way the game developers make money is by offering micro transactions in their store for cosmetic upgrades that done affect game play want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look maybe shop for a set of cosmetic arm or looks want your fireball to look like a dragon there is a micro transaction for that want a lizard with a bell on its back to follow you around like a puppy there a micro transaction for that i have put hundreds of hours into the game using their native client because i started playing before the game was on steam and found buying the micro transactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more and more and more and more content to the game while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic micro transactions there are a few no cosmetic micro transactions available to upgrade your account with more character slots i believe the default is twelve so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the seven classes and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters the default you get is four which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in two thousand and thirteen but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in two thousand and sixteen there are also premium stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours the game is free so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game
early access review what do i like nothing the game stinks now removing the game and moving on to something else all good things must come to an end this good thing was kinda short lived but to each his own no building skill required anymore too many bad things to say not enough time to type them all down so long free am ill be sure to stay away from anything else you do
hello in like and welcome to my review of this broken in trash game lets start off with something simple play in style as you know dash was official introduced to the game since the beginning of this season and i am getting in sick of it it completely broken the meta for aggressive players like me thus blocking the ranking up ability well maybe another thing maybe the weapons are balanced no they in a rent guess what per every three or four in matches i encounter you know what the most broken and overpowered weapon in the game since the dash update and nerds and buffs in bow well there are some weapons to counter it like huh blasters right no they counter of this bow besides bow maybe other weapons are fair and balanced in some way no cut guess what scythe it should go and knock the down in one direction not in pairing and in her to the bottom of the in map at least scythe is counter able but by what tatars well the weapon is actually balanced in some way but can be cancerous with its easy silver combo okay but if you are very good you can rank up with every weapon right no you cant because guessing what lots of money that live spent during my brawl all game time went for in nothing i at least except the servers to work but no you like we know that you spent lots of money buying in our game but you and the servers mammoth games first time like being disconnected from ranked game causing a tragic loup twenty seventeen colonized well if you and your friends simply look for nice game to beat the out of each other for boring days i greatly recommend the game but if you want to rank up and be the no you mammoth games
latest updates turned planes into a freaking joke capped roll controls capped pitch controls automatic zeroing of controls at this point its not a plane anymore its a god damned flying car wouldn't recommend anymore they keep dumping down the controls
early access review a bad magic clone full of all the same mistakes made by its antiquated predecessor mana flood screw mid game dead draws due to useless excess mana cards in order to try and prevent the aforementioned its gorgeous to look at but it plays exactly like the game they cloned to make it and with the deus deciding their time between this and the equally clunky hearthstone cash in called elder scrolls legends neither game gets updates nearly quickly or reliably enough and neither game has anything truly unique to offer
early access review submitted a ticket to support a week ago asking to get my character restored since it was deleted from the account sent in three different tickets and have heard nothing back at all i didst duplicate items exploit bugs nothing support team has disappointed me to the point of asking for a refund

fun to play for a while really enjoyed it played a lot of artificial intelligence to practice and played mostly arena there are certainly issues with the game for instance how long it takes to unlock the gods without buying the thirty god pack but the one really terrible aspect was the matchmaking i had very few close matches and if i won a match the next time i played no one seemed to have a clue it was as if the game saw you win a couple and stacked a team against you to make you lose it got to the point where i really have trouble wanting to log in to a match it was very similar to paladins too many one sided matches too many times the teams should have been mixed up you can tell when one team has borders high fantasy points higher god levels against a team full of level one gods with the basic default everything feels pointless and demoralizing maybe hi re doesn't care about anything but sports or they done know how to match people of similar skill done know but i stopped playing paladins because of it and i am most likely going to stop playing smite there are better games that have development teams dedicated to game play rather than just sports and cash shops done mind the cash shops and the cool skins but when you play six matches in a day and get stomped each time you cant get enough points to get the cool stuff most losses came from playing with people who had no clue how the game worked didst buy items ran in and died every time or could not follow up anything soon i would recommend trying the game out but done spend any money unless its a game you really really feel your gonna be dedicated even when matchmaking sucks the soul out of you as for me live had much more frequent fun close games with over watch defense of the ancients two and laugh out loud
if you thoroughly enjoy mobile games done read this review old this game is either a mobile port or designed to be like one enough said i go into nitpick opinionated details further in the review this game is not what i expected unfortunately this game is much worse than i expected i saw this on the new releases section of the store homepage and instantly thought you know the last time i played yugo was in sixth grade id like to try it again of boy this was a slap in the face to me a teenager wanting to tap into my nostalgia of this card game that i loved when i was one thousand one hundred and twelve the first thing i noticed was that the game which is rendered in a a window had two sidebars blocked off with the yugo duel link logo printed on it the only part of the screen you actually do things in is the center portion that has the dimensions of a phone in portrait mode for me it is beyond difficult to get through the tutorial battle because i can barely navigate through such a joke of a guy it was then that i realized this game was either a mobile port or for some stupid reason designed to be played like a mobile game no just no you done put a mobile game of a beloved franchise and put it on steam if you want to put a yugo game on steam just make one intended for personal computer macintosh and linux that has no trace of mobile concepts like that gems bullshit or the actual functioning resolution being limited to a phone screen also the recommended specs of this game are complete bullshit an i and gtd nine hundred and seventy for this honestly if you have a gtd nine hundred and seventy this is not the game to use its horsepower on i strongly recommend that if you have any sort of dislike for mobile games or a desire to play a good yugo game on a desktop platform try to suffer through the lack of content on steam and look for something else online also the main starting screen in the park area looks similar to the one from the baku an is game if anybody here ever played that
early access review month after month there will be updates to worsen the game from its original glory do not give these people your money you will regret it within the month this game was once though provoking and fun any dumb dumb with enough cash could be the best at this game now disgusting is the direction this game constantly goes beware
my funny story about my first time on this game my friend told me to join hes world so i did we played for like a few hours and i learned a lot i started farming crag wood logs windows and other blocks to make my house detailed and good looking till it went nighttime on the game i realised that i couldn't see without torches lights i placed down a few torches in my wooden house and it looked pretty cool until my house which i spender two hours on burned down we a rent friends anymore
product received for free early access review game has gone to after the new epic failure update i will stop playing and advise that the community stops too so that they revert the epic loot update this has been the worst since the removal of mega bots as the rise of the megabits update was one of my played the game far before steam enrolled it since june twenty thirteen actually June
at last a grand sphinx will teach you to respect cower in fear of my lord of the lost lands enough of your vandalism you have awakened us this will now be your tomb a a pretty much sums up the game
warning highly addictive very fun and well presented real time strategy haring back to the golden age of games done well even better you can play this fun time consumer totally free it doesn't try to nickle and dime you at every stage it lets you know where to get any rat boost if you so desire without ramming it down your throat no bad points really so at a stretch sometimes not very often you click a character and it sends them to a random room above or below the one they are in easily solved by replacing them in the original room
unbelievable funny game at first so much i invested a little nothing much but still i had to reinstall my machine all backups worked but the vaults from this game gone and with them time and money the nice thing was that no one is feels responsible for this game steam links to bethesda and their page is useless and to it they done even have a real support it seems after twenty min i haven found a way to actually open a ticket on their page so thanks for nothing careful with this
early access review bought this game second time but still this game is unplayable after finishing training when i enter in town very first time first person shooter drop constantly game not even let me choose a maximize window doesn't help i read so many positive things from development but sorry to admit i might come to wrong place wrong game in year twenty eighteen tab target is worst decision may be i come for third time if they change tab target option sorry at bad review watching others video and actually playing is different things i followed some streamers opinion and bought this game another time again my worst decision May
early access review this game is grind simulator and communist propaganda bought storm ewer forty our for a and all i got was russian players killing me with their tula to are basic weapon from crappy factory in siberia this game deserves no attention and should be left to die in some dark abyss
early access review had to change my review from negative to positive the computer does cheat but only after you go on a hot streak and win quite a few free packs then the a i just does what it wants and you will lose but in of with that as long as it doesn't always cheat in fine with the house needing to come out ahead sometimes even if its unfair this game is a hell of a lot of fun for both single player and multi if even a little bit of you loves tags look no further this has it all and for the record i did support this game by purchasing all the campaigns and two full boxes of cards its a great free game but it absolutely is worthy of supporting it to keep it going this was my original post i have changed how i feel and updated above game was fun until they recently upgraded the a i to cheat like crazy during any single player modes the developers must have got tired of people doing well in forge and gauntlet so now i regularly lose way before completing either due to ridiculous draws by the computer scrounging for twenty five hundreds gold only to lose a on the first match of forge has happened way too much since they changed things of well it was fun while it lasted
early access review seriously amazing game pub totally accurate battlegrounds need to learn a thing about optimisation this games is aesthetically pleasing to look at and runs smoothly its quirky and has its own niche obviously this game has a lot to work on thus having a lot of potential a gone servers please a party system and more custom sable settings for example there are some bugs but they a rent worth mentioning i support this game one hundred good job developers download it while its free
early access review this is a great game but whenever you unlock something new you have two options grind for ten hours or spend a around eight to get the item you want it is quite sad to see such a good game go to waste because of the fact that it gets boring only being able to play with two weapons if you are not into grinding for ages like most people i hope the deus sort this out because i love this game but the hole system spoils it
early access review way more polished than pub also free the main thing to know is what differences it has compared to other games in the genre you get a starting load out and there are actual spawn points you choose your spawn during the the one minute setup and you can see where other players are spawning as well the spawns are well spaced out this coupled with the starting equipment means that the start of the game is less insane than other battle royal games you never feel like you re taken out before you have a chance to play even in the inevitable city frenzies everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kicks of the traversal equipment is the most unique thing about this game with each load out you get a gun a piece of equipment med it extra ammo act and a mobility item you have a choice between hang glider snowboard and climbing kit with the han glider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you were going snowboard allows you to move at vehicle speeds on any downward slope finally the climbing gear allows you to climb at special places on the map that other players would have to take the long way around the climbing gear int really as fun but they counter that by starting you with a shotgun finally you are not fighting till the last man team standing you are trying to board a chopper with only four seats however most of the time it still turns into a last man team standing game but the fact that if you can create enough chaos you might be able to climb that ladder without being blasted adds a bit of spice to the end game
early access review of how i loved this game i remember how good it was back in the day when it had the tech tree and no bull that is now known as the double skills or something like that when you can shoot in too modes with one weapon i hated the update where they removed the tech tree but now with the crates this has become another one of those counter strike team fortress two crate luck games so i think i wont be playing this game any time soon i will probably come to check it once in a while to see if they've listened to their old players peace
spent hours trying to get into the game stuck on loading screen eighty tried everything nothing work cant even play the game bow i wanted to play the a game but nothing works and i tried everything on youtube and we people suggested
personally i think this game is very bad the graphics are really bad i think they have made other better versions of this game that cost money those i think might be better but done waste your time downloading this game its not worth it
early access review yea real good game spent about fifty dollars on skins and weapons except now i cant even play the game because it only blacks screens and no one has a fix for it
cute terror my this thing scared the living daylight out of satan himself true story seriously in a fan of the horror genre and this has lived to my expectations one thousands might sound like a lot but when you re running to save to from the i done know what the hell was behind me man rooms go by fast a true gem
when i first started defense of the ancients two i was a little overwhelmed as my first arts mob game it was pretty complicated i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying before i knew it i was performing better and better i stopped making silly mistakes and i got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team for the most part everyone live met was very helpful and nice there have sometimes the jerk however as i continue to play defense of the ancients two more and more in sure ill continue to improve i recommend this game for all yes i used google translate you can kill me now
to start off lets do a quick summary of what els word is els word is a anime styled side scrolling free to play class based role playing game fighter in which you are given the choice of nine different characters to fight with level up and evolve so to say each character has different skill trees which can be chosen to fit your personal game play style like to play as a free knight and acquire romancer abilities choose telesis like being a tank for your team choose chung how about being an archer to attack from long range choose rena this selection of characters is great for all kinds of players and helps broaden the audience for this game it has typical elements which you can expect from an role playing game armour special weapons potions grinding it center these elements fit well into the world of els word helping you defeat bosses in dungeons to earn experience points and gain better armour and weapons speaking of bosses there may be repetition with such bosses as xanthus but besides that they are both challenging and rewarding the game itself seems to get very addicting when you are trying to level up your character and get them to their next form or evolution as live said before the stamina bar is used to prevent addiction this bar is gradually used up as you complete dungeons and once you are out of stamina you cannot do any more dungeons for the day stamina is refilled every day though as well as having unlimited stamina at weekends so all you fanatics can play to your hearts content in closing i believe els word is a fun vibrant and addicting game and i recommend it to all of you anime or role playing game lovers May
early access review eternal is a very generous collectible card game if you want a great free to play experience in a collectible card game eternal is the place to go building the best decks is completely doable if you put in some effort even the campaigns can be bought with in game currency that can be earned through any game mode playing experience eternal is complex enough to keep a lot of players occupied for a long time the pace of the games feel comfortable quickly and good balancing keeps me as interesting there seems to always be more then one met deck this game feels far from stale competitively different decks come out on top every time whilst ring doesn't have to much impact to be annoying all in all this is a captivating highly enjoyable and highly addictive game id recommend it to anybody who likes a challenge
warning play this game you might curse sometimes the developers have done a good job in making war thunder a reasonably realistic massively multiplayer online war game lately i have been playing the tanks and can report to you that the key to knocking out an enemy tank is to kill all of its crew as opposed to the tank having hit points as it is in the other major massively multiplayer online tank game this game may take a little bit to get used to but once you do it can be addictive fun i believe war thunder deserves at least one award for its hard work including research and development in bringing the nearly forgotten war machines to life May
early access review so my friends and i bought the game to have fun with and immediately it was clear that there was a skill gap so i went to try ranked out and i was playing scarlet and i was then swiftly and easily destroyed by a hat tori who then after the game said spam much and called me a one thousand and ten would get eviscerated and mocked again
early access review not much fun has wacky arm or and that all that it has if you are looking for a battle royal alternative this is not it the controls are like trying to steer someone through syrup
early access review great game it always has you running panicked and confused it makes the horror experience complete with jump scares and a confusing but compelling story mystery you just cant pull away from this game
early access review really good game unlike ninety of battle royal games it actually brings something original and new to the table obviously its in development and int perfect a few bugs and glitches here and there but nothing too serious the only issues i really have are the hit boxes not gonna lie they re kinda bad and please make it to where when you just cant go into places you cant fit when you re prone instead of it having you stand up live been killed several times because of this
this game will make you quit and delete it in a few games as you play the balance of this game is just no where to be seen and the grind is just one of the main problem it makes you think the boosters will help but it wont do to much and before the grind got screwed up their used to be a option to just buy the weapons or vehicles without talking a long time even other games such as world of tanks or war thunder could let you get it right off the bat this game surely needs a reboot because this game unit going far its only makes other wii games much better than this sure it dose have good maps and nice graphics but it docent cover the rage and pain to deal through a game my word for it never get it until theirs three good reviews in a row on it and if not just done get it will save your lifetime and for the people who have this game heres a note never give a single penny to this game it wont do you much now and also if you do play it go for german its the only team that can win with its ridiculous unbalance team updated to add this on since its been a while i will admit this they got the idea and the feel of whats its like in the war the guns and weapons are well detailed and the hard work of the people who did this much on the visual of the game is great but since i haven played it in a while my bets its not much changed maybe half grind but the balance of the game is still a mystery overall give it a shot at least if you want but done give a penny to them because if we stop giving them the cash maybe they will finally fix some of the major problems in this game but any who take care you guys and fight on in the war updated one hundred and eleven thousand one hundred and sixteen since its veterans day i thought playing this game would do it but it really didst for whats new going on about this just getting worse and this whole game might abandon ship they got ride of bikes and the old trucks from the spawn point witch really is sad because that the simple way to go to one place or another and not have to be forced to buy a truck repairs in this game is just more sad because paying that much your losing about twenty one thousand coins in that game for just that one weapon still no since of balance of guns or ranks grind is still not great and the game balance of when their three enemy planes and your team has none id who did there research but surely they didst had much logic of having something little balance in the game buying gold is just pat hic just have it at simple numbers like four hundred and ninety nine or nine hundred and ninety nine its that easy maybe they need to get a buck more to survive but surely this game is still have no single thing of redemption in it for just something simple have the game or balance of ranks teams and guns done charged a lot of paying or repairing weapons and at least have some respect of whats the purpose of the game this game has places where battle actually happen and all over million lives lost in the war total weather its axis allies or even citizens you really need to know whats it just like being in their shoes so this game works but still not even if you want to try it go ahead but done donate to them if there going to screw you over in the future a suggestion of another game would be post scrip tum as it has no pay to win a lot more balanced and a bit more content in my opinion as its still early game but its more playable than he
early access review was getting back to this game a couple of times and at each time it was different not worse because i could still build my robots in peace now its gone last and final attempt was when maximum load out update came in i done say it was bad to be honest it gave a player a possibility to efficiently fight against all kind of robots but thing that finally made me think bad about this game is role play nerf free am agreed it was too rough and fixed it hah done make me laugh you re looking at one hundred and forty hours for a mega legs and a mega lasers role play price reductions and time buys i would need to play a more hours that i played to get it its about fort three two hundred zero role play about fifty two a role play for battle as an average player before fix i took for good tom one hundred and fifty a two hundred a role play which want much now for same battle i take fifteen a for great one with most kills and damage twenty five a at lvi ninety eight with a robot this is a mockery after nerf and fix most of players still get ten of role play what they get earlier free am ruined the greatest thing about this game an ability to build everything what you can imagine without working about money you are making a tank but miss one sub machine gun to finish here play twenty three hours to get it if deus wanna keep that fix they better should do something with matchmaking the most expensive parts are only thing that will keep a alive in battle and deal real damage without them you will be crushed at first encounter with enemy to grind all evening to get one good part
planet side two is not a regular first person shooter its kind of like a big battlefield map but bigger there are no rounds and intermissions it feels like you re waging real war like in war its unfair it promotes team play and sooner or later you will want to join an outfit a guild in massively multiplayer online role playing game terms to fight alongside teammates if you like morphs and big scale fuses and are okay with things being unfair once in a while i can wholeheartedly recommend planet side two if you expect super spaced fights sick kill streaks and xxscopezzmlgxx clans please stay with call of duty
i have been an avid bethesda game fan since oblivion putting hundreds of hours into both oblivion and sky rim played all of the downloadable content role played dozens of characters and beat both of the games several times i have no idea what is going on with bethesda as a company but it seems like at this point they are taking advantage of their fan bases trying to squeeze as much money out of the franchise as possible and killing the life it has i was disappointed to hear about yes six not being developed for the next decade or so or the fact that they created a creation club and the fact that they released sky rim on about a dozen platforms but this game you have to pay to play this game you literally have to buy the acts to actually play the game this is a mobile game they make revenue off of ads already i found this game fun but i done want to touch it anymore just for the simple fact that you have to purchase acts that done even last that long there is no real content that you are purchasing what are they charging you for is to bethesda please stop ruining my favourite franchise with your money grabbing greed i would be spent more money on my own accord purchasing packs but simply wont touch this game again because you are forcing me to dish out money for you you used to be my favourite gaming studio i used to day dream about working at bethesda but now i cringe at the thought of your studio and the shell of itself it used to be
this game is awesome it is a third person role playing game with hundreds of missions and an in game speaker so you can talk to your friends and the people your playing with other features include mounts companions healing devices multi person dungeons and lots more you can buy in game cash but its best to stick to playing it without emptying your wallet because it gets so addictive that you could not have any more to spend on other games i highly recommend this
live put some time into this game and i enjoyed it a lot as a casual player however live recently been running into a bug issue that has caused my game to freeze and crash and live tried everything to try and fix this lowered my graphics settings verified folder integrity uninstalled and re installed contacted hire which has the saddest support team they contacted me back in a about a day said my case would be transferred to the proper department and nothing i even responded to the email to check in which is said to do and still nothing its a shame really the money and time live put into this game and they cant help me with a issue in having i keep getting negative hits and got a you will be banned warning due to the fact that the game keeps crashing constantly too afraid to even try and play a match due to the fact i might get banned but even if i done it still sucks because its like in banned anyways because i cant play its pretty i cant recommend a game that has such horrible support for its players
this is a promising new idle game with a lot more strategy and unique objectives than the competition the downside is that progress can slow down a lot after a while since some planned features seem to be missing its a bit too reliant on ring and it eats up a lot more memory than it probably should but hopefully those issues will get ironed out over time
the game itself is fun well made and is worth a look at but requiring the player to pay real money for all equipment makes it a fun unfair and a recommended i can see a membership being something better maybe premium items like custom skins but requiring real money for everything even the default items spare equipment drops my score greatly graphics audio playability heavy minus on micro transactions regulating the entire game end total four hundred and ten
while writing this review live over one thousand hours played several characters with max lvi and finished all end game content the good pretty good and enjoyable combat system pretty much the reason i still play it decent graphics option for free two play players to get almost everything from the real cash shop though its hard and time consuming decent events and promotions once in a while includes player versus player events hourly activity event system this is one of the best things which can happen to massively multiplayer online it pretty much helps to reduce queue times and give some bonus rewards to the players the bad this game had few heavy current exploits which total ruined the economy lots of the exploited currency was not removed and impact this game to this day many exploiters were not banned and run in best in slot items without any penalty real money means very little unless you can spend several thousand of on a game basically if you would want to get full bis gear you need like two thousand of real bugs take months to get fixed if they even bother to fix them in the first place lots of overpowered items which come from lock boxes sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like data two several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags very poor class balance extremely poor player versus player balance for example you can move your best in slot enchant from your high lvi character to a total low lvi character and use it in player versus player because it have no min lvi required i think i done have to explain how much impact it have even at max lvi player versus player there insane gear gap between players refiling system pretty much pay to win feature it makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lots of real to get nearly bis or bis gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops this game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players if this doesn't change in near future it will be the reason why this game dies
early access review game has a great base but horrible balancing dove is a refers dream being unable to fight your own faction for elite spawns makes you want to rip your hair out new nerds to every class took the fun out of player versus player duping bug destroyed the economy and will never be punished spent too much money on this game for the terrible infrastructure and dishonesty from the developers this game is not worth spending your time or money on the game has become increasingly more and more controversial by the day and for good reason i tried to give it time and let them work the kinks out its very clear that it is becoming worse as time goes on rather than better if you can get your money back and pull out before its too late sadly it probably is for me
pro looks finish character creation is awesome con combat system is is not existing gtd one thousand and eighty barely sixty dps in small camps not even constant phasing makes parties split you cant really play with friend might be only at the beginning it has potential but it need a lot of work
i have more than two thousand hours of playing this game now with a high leo in some game modes like arena and assault and how do i get rewarded for those achievements i get paired with people who done even have fifty hours of game play against a team of balanced players you see because i have a high leo hires algorithm thinks that if i get paired with people with low leo my leo will balance it out to a regular match so i go positive or almost in all my games almost always top dog and still cant win because i get at least a lvi twenty feeder every match the worst part is that when you try to give tips to those people on how to get better they get really defensive and toxic this really really ruined the game to the point that its completely unplayable for me its been a problem for years but recently its been the worst its ever been for me
early access review first i would like to say not to pay attention to all those idiots who say this game is pay to win now that is really stupid did you honestly expect the developers to keep on pulling money out of their asses you still have one world in creatives to do with whatever you like i done see how that is a problem at all considering the costs for maintaining hundreds of worlds from just one player is ridiculous creatives pro gets the developers more money to make more awesome updates for the game in my opinion this game is awesome you can make cornerstones to make a blueprint out of so you can get a house up without thinking of a really neat design for a house night mobs are quite difficult to start with but a rent so difficult as you progress through the game which i find to be a you can claim your own territory and dictate what settings are available in your territory which is really nice
a great game to enjoy with friends if you enjoy battlefield call of duty or any other generic first person shooter then this is the game for you done expect to enjoy the game if you re in it for cdr though because this game int about cdr and you will get frustrated if that is all you focus on if you want to make cert the in game currency then you should play medic medic will net you your weight in certs faster and easier than any other class i came back and played this again recently and dear god they may have improved some features but some weapons just wow they've nerved so many things into the ground back when i played there was an log that was specific to the van its called the lasher now back then the weapon was good it did decent are damage on impact to force people back from doorways and if you direct hit you could go toe to toe with another heavy it was considered garbage even at that point in the game but i liked it because if you could land your hits you could out dps people but only if you could land all of them the lasher is in the trash now the are the thing the weapon was designed for is practically gone both damage wise and range wise many other weapons share the same fate it makes me wonder whf the developers are doing every weapon that int just a plain jane of its class sort of blows but i came back to look at the construction update and all the others live missed since two thousand and thirteen the game has some nice new features sufferers the mobile a pc spawn points can have cloaking fields not sure how i feel about them taking more than two a to blow up now though if they have a special arm or type i used to be a pilot but seeing all the changes in not touching that with a ten foot pole the rest of the game play is relatively the same it takes a while to get decent at the game and once you do that it the platoons and outfits done communicate a whole lot the games only saving grace from becoming an endless shooter which is fine if you re into that but in not should be the community but nobody talks there in game voice chat but nobody likes casual conversation it seems that the only people playing are in it for the cert things you spend to unlock equipment now if you do find a good group of people to play with its a fun game if you done you re going to get bored really quickly in not sure if id recommend this may
early access review so far live played through the tutorial missions to unlock each deck i can already see in going to be dumping loads of hours into the game as a big card game player already mtg hearthstone duels and shadow verse i can say that the mechanics in this game while borrowed really flourish with mechanics that make sense the only gripe i have is some effects on cards a rent explained in detail when you scroll over it it seems to only give a basic definition of what keywords are some cards have non key worded words on them that you would need to go look up to know
i like the game played way to much of it dim nearing on three hundred hours at the time of this post if your competitive its definitely a good place to be every once and a while they release new characters and weapons which helps to keep the game fresh
worst free to play game i ever saw if you want invest two hundred you can enjoy this hardcore walking simulator seriously even a concentration camp is more enjoyable than this game
you want to get rid of your social life you want to throw your money against a wall for stupid effects you want to play with russians you are still reading this then download this a a a a a try not to become a a a a a a who has over five hundred games with sniper
cool game to play with your friends its chilling but still lots of bugs that shouldn't be in the game like timer stuck people not moving people teleworking and lots of times only one person of the game is lucky all others have to pay positive review when most of the bugs disappeared
awesome game sim great graphics i can even run this max settings on a and personal computer no problems with prettiness to optimisation crank that graphics setting up other than that the driving is great the physics int to great when hitting stuff other than that great def give a try also for ftp it has a great selection of cars and tracks not a lot but i mean its ftp tbs i expected a lot less would recommend this at least try a you knock it one thousand and ten ign
i have decided to get back into realm once again through the web client version and it is a very exciting game so i have decided to come back from my extremely old review with no reason to recommend and have completely reworked and rewritten the review with constant imaginative enemies fighting you ranging from cute but deadly bunnies to oryx the mad god himself this game is a bullet hell and god damn is it a crazy bullet hell missiles flying in every direction imaginable enemies releasing missiles in every direction adds the challenge to room as you really have to learn how to use the controls effectively before being able to imagine the higher levels but those higher levels are extremely rewarding if you reach so it is absolutely worth the time doing dungeons there is a natural annoyance with the business model it has very expensive packages being sold which can be bought with the in game payed currency gold or just money with just the beginner package being sold for twenty for a new account and sixty after however none of the packages in room actually need to be bought you can achieve the same as anyone else without paying it is harder yes but it int like its quicker if you pay its just easier if you do overall i would recommend this game from the point of view that it is free to play so you re not wasting anything by buying it
now this is an incredible game challenging in further difficulties and very personalised to your specific build most free play games are not worth thirty hours of your time this will give you satisfaction for months at the least those of you who remember diabolo two will love it it has very many similarities and is far superior to the simplistic of diabolo three in my opinion this is the diabolo three we all truly wanted
infestation the new before you read i would like to say that i have over three hundred hours on this game before steam release infestation the new is an official rework of the original and bad title infestation survivor stores formerly known as the war the new is being worked on by a whole new development team called freda is about there is not a single development from the original is on this development team everyone knows the war and how bad the game was it was riddled with hackers it was seriously pay to win loot was rare so it made hackers even more populated it was full of bugs that deus did not patch and lets be honest there was no content all there was to do is player versus player now on the other hand freda is about the team behind this game have been doing a great job in correcting the errors that the past development team did they are listening to the community and trying their best to make a game that you guys want they have released an anti cheat called mag anti cheat this anti cheat was designed just for this game i have over three hundred hours before steam and i have only got cheated once i repeat once due to the lack of content the previous game had they made about ten different player versus player server maps so you can hop into it and player versus player right away they made a custom battle royal they added airdrop these drop about every hour on official servers they have revamped the user interface they have added a lot of guns that the original is did not have and army helmets it center and they added skins three traders dream they have completely removed the pay two win aspect of the game now all you have to do is kill zombies and players and you can buy every single thing in the market they have not removed go gold credits you can use this to purchase a private server to loot or to buy premium and buy skins in the market place this is just to support this game and keep it alive some of you guys need to understand they need to have a few things they can make money off of a game is not free they need some sort of money to pay for all of their servers that ten thousand people are playing on
early access review people will compare this to pub or say its a copy but people are just not used to have fun this game is very comic i like the game play so much i am very bad and pub and footnote but in cuisine royal i can actually have fun it feels like everybody around you has the same skills as you i like wii design and weapons and i specially like the use of kitchen stuff as arm or cant wait for future updates this game has alone to give
early access review overall a pretty standard battle royal game towards the pub side i did enjoy it and the character creator is probably the best part about it the animations and game play actually reminds me of the division just slower and less bugs gunplay is lacklustre though
new client is awesome i love the looks and feel of the game once the kinks are ironed out this gonna be way better than the crappy ugly old client game still is addictive and fun and best of all legitimately free to play
liked team fortress two until the competitive update it destroyed casual you cant switch teams i prefer to be in team blythe auto balance is gone and because of that there are so unbalanced teams you cant even think of four minutes loosing in cart game then you have to wait so long to get onto a server also you cant search a server anymore like you could before why the heck did you touched casual valve really was better before the competitive to
early access review fun to mess around in but at the end of the day it doesn't require skill and you have to buy either assault rifle four thousand seven hundred and twelve or the blazer which are the best rifles and sniper
i am an avid hunter in northern arizona this game makes me feel like i am actually hunting that nice big mule deer but the game is not free to play when you get it you are only allowed to hunt mule deer and rabbit in only one area of the game if you want to hunt other animals you have to pay for licenses and the weapons to hunt those animals to advertise a game like this as a free to play is wrong it should be advertised as a free to win game as the only way to get that big whitetail moose or elk is to buy a membership then spend cash for coins to buy bigger and better guns i recommend the game if you like great graphics and the feeling of outdoors but not as a hunting game buy one of cab las games everything is included and you done have to spend over twenty thousand to get great stuff
in getting tired of clicker games on steam but i cant get that get on the way its a good clicker at least it shows something different formation tactics so not bad but to game developers and steam itself we are getting tired of clickers
early access review step one download step two launch step three create a new world step four wander around step five make a taming bell step six tame email step seven be a pokemon master i mean be a creatives tamer would catch email
this game looks awesome and its free free is never truly free but that is the marketing model this game will continue to developed for years to come this game has come a long way since two thousand and nine that right two thousand and nine its been reworked a lot of times and its always getting better this is one of the most fair free to play models in the market each track takes hundreds of hours of work some of the newer tracks have the cost of laser scanning on top of the time to write it nearly every game out today sells downloadable content this base game is free you forty to sixty ahead just for trying it if you like it then get what you like if not at least you did not blow forty to sixty for a game you only play once in a while the cars that come with the game are good enough to get a feel for the game but if you like the game your gonna need to buy the tracks and cars you want there are packs available to save you some money you will probably spend sixty to eighty for the content you want if you like the game all the content is about two hundred and fifty or so i used this on my fanatic wheel and my a controller both play well at this current time most of what this game has to offer surpasses every other sim i have played including a when a first came out it had this beat now with a few updates later it is better both graphically and in terms of physics i only wish the game had dayton road course i have been a supporter of this game long before it was ported to steam about two thousand and nines or so this game really does continue to get developed
early access review this game actually pulled me away from hearthstone i love the synergy of the different mechanics the flexibility of the dec building and the creative modes and challenges i highly recommend this game to any fans of hearthstone or magic the gathering if you keep finding you want more out of your collectible card game eternal really strikes a great balance between accessibility and depth while providing plenty of generous rewards glasses you in the draft edit i forgot to mention how friendly all of the players live met have been the community is very welcoming and happy to help new players or discuss strategy
old this game is fun it int pay to win in any kind of waive read some negative review and had to say something about the pay to win aspect it is not pay to win you have to buy better towers and their upgrades with in game currency which is awarded by winning games you pay to a special amount of coins to play a game if you win you get two times as much back you start with zero coins and by winning seven games you get a ranking in the world region ladders where reaching different ranks awards a good amount of coins every wednesday so if you start playing sunday you get how the game works on monday win a few games on thursday and get the coins on wednesday you have gone from zero to one thousand coins in three days and max thirty win after this you could get worlds first in your second week of playing even in the first week because its play non another note you need to win games to unlock the purchase of better towers and their upgrades so once more you need to play to get better also if you done want to waste your money done spend any i had about twenty five thousand coins after my first week which is about one hundred in real life
playing since two thousand and eights and still my favourite go to shoot up live made real life friends and had more laughs than i can count i still play rather vanilla but enjoy that the community can and has played such a big part in developing items and creating a wild economy within the game
early access review did not think i was going to like this game i would recommend this game very spooky but god damn those in chase parts get me jump scares he not so much but the in chases those suck it goes on through like thirty rooms and then of course they are all ghosts so you gotta move fast to get ahead of them but they go through the damn walls in on room one hundred saved taking a break i done think that was wine so far
early access review its free magic the gathering online and it kinda owns earning cards is so much easier than most free card games out there the game hands you a to on of to play with deck building is more interesting than a certain card game that limits you to thirty cards and thirty cards only you can make a deck of just about any size depending on the game mode so long as your deck consists of one third power mana cards
glitchy bug when trying to go to full screen mode all i get is a black screen tried to uninstall the game to revert it back to normal settings still in full screen and black would be a decent game if i could play it
to or great game being tarnished by bad development practices departs debacle as of late is a good example of it to start this game is fantastic currently you have planes and tanks with hundreds of hours worth of enjoyable combat and ship helicopters entering closed beta testing no other game on the market can provide such a great combined arms firefight with options for pretty much everyone arcade for casuals and realistic battles for more hardcore player engine is utterly fantastic for any game more so a free to play game absolutely amazing performance on any system can almost run on your microwave while having great graphics on the highest settings only downside is to fully customize graphics you need to edit the co fig file but its pretty easy to do if you look it up and totally int necessary i could go on and on regarding the positives since the base game is in my opinion one of the best free to play games on the market but you probably noticed the fact i would not recommend this game to others even if i continue to play the game why because gain they have a tendency to not fix problems for many years until a suitable outrage builds up and until then they gladly censor people wherever possible for speaking out against them outside of this they gladly introduce a bunch of premium vehicles and at varying tiers to enjoy a proper lineup of vehicles one must purchase a premium vehicle such as the re they also will extremely increase the grind in order to line their pockets with be purchases to skip the stock syndrome as they themselves call it special notice to unlocking parts and fire protection up which parts are needed to repair your tank after its damaged which happens a lot and up is needed to put out fires these parts can each take fifty thousand one hundred battles on a higher tier vehicle due to performing noticeably worse when stock for example they posted a video on their youtube channel called overcoming the stock syndrome a bunch of tips that are actually horrible for game play and grinding were mentioned and the other possible fix was to spend money to skip said grind this video then unsurprisingly received a down votes versus one thousand up votes comment section filled with people calling out foreigner and saying parts should be free and not ground out for then anywhere it removing the grind for parts on a foreigner operated platform the discussion is censored this parts int the first nor last time foreigner perform a practice like this i can not recommend people who haven played this game to do so you will most likely end up enjoying it only to run into game play hampered by greedy practice if foreigner ever turn this around starting by somehow reducing removing the parts grind then i will change the recommendation to a yes
horrid support sketchy missile dynamics they ban people who show broken parts of the planes or the game itself they updated steam regional prices which made it more expensive than normal currency exchange rate and when there is a problem between steam and digital combat simulator what they suggest is stop using steam why do you release it on steam if you are going to give no support for steam users in definitely not going to buy stuff out of their sketchy website which you get no support whatsoever done mind my game hour as live been forced to play it from standalone
lets start with the fact that well having a dragon doesn't really one the doors if you know what i mean you might be able to fly but whats the point if there a rent a lot of things to do with your dragon that have a meaning impact or are fun the second thing is that there are a lot of pay walls the chances are that you wont really hold to the game for a long time as most of the content new or old will need the use of your wallet another thing is the fact that there a rent really a lot of interesting quests that give you some sense of accomplishment or are fun it feels like if you re doing all of this just to waste your time which might not be bad if you want a time aster as far as i know there are such players and lets not even talk about the bugs to put it simply its a buggy mess with not a lot of reasons to play it and on top of that is also made to be milked as well
early access review only started playing yesterday but live already put in quite a few hours this game rocks visually stunning graphics varied game play that requires skill and tactical planning and a great nona town set up all adds up to a great game and its still early access i cant wait to see what the final game looks like
early access review have an older computer that just meets their minimum requirements done get this game have a less than perfect internet connection or use wifi done get this game bottom line is this game not only has poor server connectivity requiring a players connection to be just so to avoid being disconnected from battles each disconnect counts against you too many and you get slapped with a five minute penalty the penalty is fair enough to discourage rage quitters but does not reset if you done play for an extended period of time so if you done play for a few months and got disconnected enough to gain a penalty you still have to wait five minutes only to see that servers will still kick you from games for having a less than optimum system
there are almost no restrictions on how far the enemy can go to your spawn and then they can camp your spawn and you cant do anything to win the game and they make new people fight pros before the games was so good and very addictive and it was easy to grind for money and experience points but now its almost impossible to get new weapons and new careers the deus real need to listen to the people to make the game a lot more fun for the people and not to make it so unfair and they should stop banning people who have bought stuff for hacking heating just so the person gets a new a count and buys more stuff but me my self have not experienced this but there are very many people saying that it has happen to them and i have only have been finding for the money and the experience points another thing is that people can camp the trucks for people who spawn and the deus are not doing she about it and its to unfair for people live already said this but they real need to make it so that new people are up against other new people or attest a little more experience in the game but not all of them because then the enemy will have automatic guns and your team all have starter guns one more thing i forgot to say sometimes people are supper bad at the game and get your entire team to loose with stupid ideas
early access review great combat the rest is a massive dumpster fire slap on the wrist for duper nothing said about having fourteen the content is up version had patches that have not been tested and make no sense pushed on live servers class balance is atrocious i could go on save your money and done buy it edit duper bans already over with most of them keeping everything low loll
early access review would not recommend it installs malware again agent that you cannot remove easily it is essentially malware it installs without being given permission to do so cannot be uninstalled from program features embeds itself in multiple separate locations reactivates itself even if you manually deactivate it reinstall itself if you delete it of and it acts as a torrent seeder for other people updating the game thus using your bandwidth so that foreigner can get their client updated for free only way to permanently remove it is to delete it uninstall war thunder go to re edit and delete all registry entries pointing at foreigner net agent
early access review hello this is my review of rob craft i am very experienced in this game i have over two thousands hours a yes for a while i did forget about a life i have been playing since twenty fourteen near launch back then it was a very fun game and no pay to win at all yes their was grinding but not as much now i personally prefer the old system for money it was better than having to grind for crappy crates i think things went downhill after the meta update the crates got added they changed a lot of stuff and messed up the game and such but as you can see much of the community has the same views as me so in going to have to say no to this game but as always it is up to you if you like the game
access review this game is great and i love to play it but there is one thing that keeps me up at night and i cant in understand it it makes no sense and it ruins the immersive ness completely almost breaks the game when i think about it because it destroys the foundations the game was built on spoiler alert if you read what is below you will never see this game the same way who takes the picture for the news of the chopper escaping dione with the last survivors i done know but it keeps me up at night
despite the constant stating that team fortress two is a dead game i highly disagree yes the community is not as lively as it used to be but this masterpiece is still kicking after ten years i plan on playing it for a very long time
had this on my phone when i was waiting for of its simple fun and good time killer a lot of new stuff has been added such as quests it center it center feels odd playing on personal computer but it opens the game up to some things dits worth a try but if a have a habit of spending money on mobile games stay away it makes this game soon easy and they made damn sure a will want to spend money redone less amounts too i am atm playing a money free run and its not a problem at all keep in mind if a spend loads of or some money on your vault and start a new one its on all of it a will not get what a spent money on over to a new vault
early access review need to get this rant out first then ill talk what i like and disliked i played this game like crazy i wont type out all that i loved about the old rob craft as i wont put a deep feeling of nostalgia to me and of hardcore fans so here it is rob craft is dead to me now it has lost all of its appeal to me a year or so ago i played this nonstop i enjoyed it to the point where i would wake up five in the morning just to play this now hah no they put a in crate system in this game with i done want that in any game and they also screw with the physics to the point where vols are no longer possible why why free am get rid of those and put back the level system of now that i got that out of the way ill tell you what i adored about this game i saw this in my recommended games looked at it read the description and what i saw was that they put min craft and robots together that description did no justice to the game those precious years ago you would have somewhat incredibly intense games in the higher tiers trust me in this before they threw out the levelling system it was adrenaline inducing three years later hey guys we decided to fucking up the game even more by adding crate why just why we early hardcore rob craft fans understand where i am coming from it really makes me sad to see this game ripped away from me i am torn between giving this a jab in the face or one hundred hours meaning i really really really really want to give this game a thumbs up but now i just cant they messed things up when a lot of us hardcore fans said no please done mess with it like that when a friend told me that there int really a tier thing meaning that any level can play any level and that any level can use any it tore me in loving memory the old rob craft is years free am if you guys read this change it back it was much better then honestly it was a lot better with tier separation and level requirements please put the level cup back i cant give this game a thumbs up now in sorry
just an overview really id score this seven hundred and ten i have this on ipad too pros well fleshed out progression system will literally last you forever no need for micro transactions if you done want them syncs with congregate cloud enabling cross device play cons literally no sound at all anywhere super repetitive can be boring as in the beginning not a lot going on on the screen difficult to see when things have updated
one of the best games ever released on steam in the past decade one thousand and ten this game combines what everyone loves in gaming strategy and fun with it being free this is a steal i highly recommend checking out one of the most famous franchises in gaming if you re a true gamer with a passion you'll definitely need to play this gem
early access review you can go back through the timeline to say which game copied who people say this is a footnote clone but he came out before footnote so is footnote a he clone this logic can go back to the beginning of video game time there no harm in variety of a genre review assuming you and someone else has equal aim skill it comes down to who has the better arm or weapon rarity however you can double dash as a warrior in their face to keep them on their toes teleport through windows as an assassin for faster looting dash straight up in the air mid shotgun fight as an engineer to confuse them or run midnight as a mage with her limited flight ability once you re out of health you've become your worst nightmare a target for spinning sword attacks however you and your fellow chickens cant swarm in from the heavens like ocarina of time you'll have to hide like a sneaky of pub style the chicken doesn't make much noise standing still if you've waited out that timer congrats now you need healing a fun extra in game concept is the use of your mount if you get tired of day running in realm royal just hit that a or zed for all you canadian mighty morphine power rangers key to pull out roach now you can gallop around town with the horse you love you can use this to run from gunfights however that would be detrimental in improving your aim so if you re tired of the toxic trash talking he wannabe nurse disrespects out there the slithery snails of pub sunbathing in the grass waiting for a prey to come by or eleven story theme mansions that people build in that this might be a game to try out somehow overnight this does not want to open on my default monitor even though i have them duplicated while running this game i need this to work on my main monitor for reasons it just black screens though seven thousand seven hundred and ten until i can get this issue fixed
early access review it plays a lot like world of warships in space and i like the different roles of the ships and if you have a team that communicates well it is a great experience some ships feel very niche and not worth playing if your team just does whatever they want so team play is pretty essential it feels very mosque but would be nice if they added some more maps and maybe some sort of creep ave the good news is the developers seem to take player feedback into consideration old space ships go zoo room pew pew pew and boom boom boom
early access review enjoy the game a lot on days when my internet is stable and not too much broadband is being used you can play it with your friends meet new friends through friends it center its pretty neat and so far live made quite a few new friends through it people id never thought id meet in sitting at about four hundred and thirty hours with probably around sixty spent on it skins are cool and possibly improved little skill wise but overran its fun doesn't require much system wise even my potato can run it and doesn't take too long to get used top a dash sucks bring back chain dodging
early access review rob craft
i love this game but fair warning get only if you like learning and int bothered by reading manuals also a joystick is a requirement that said i always wanted to get shot down by an aim and this sim fulfill that need the docs may seem overpriced but they re very well made and a ton of effort went into them May
very disappointing sim even after pouring in over three hundred dollars to the game i still could not get into it i could go in detail about all of the faults that the developers simply refuse to fix but it would take me a year very buggy sim and clueless developers
this game is very deliberate but it causes dizziness especially for me when trying to assemble all parts the view changes again and again frequently and quickly after playing for thirty min i have to give up and the feeling is very uncomfortable omitted after
early access review lets get the fact checking out of the way bless saw a original release in korea back in two thousand and eleven we done know how long it was in development but the average development cycle for games is thirty five years it can be argued that bless is a ten year old game it runs on direct nine so that alone tells you its age it failed in the korean market it failed in the russian market and it failed in japan here we are with the north american release and the game is blowing up it seems to be a very successful release right now i cannot comprehend it are we so thirsty for a new massively multiplayer online that we rush to anything that called new like its a new flavor of ice cream because this int at all new but its being marketed as new they want you to think its a early access game its note wiz is lying to you they lied about the a being a reborn version of bless we were told that bless combat would be more action orientated like black desert online what who thinks bless combat is like do absolutely no one i wont get into the whole idea that we americans have a severe whale mentality when it comes to games how we throw money at studios and developers left and right in the hope of satisfying some insatiable need for entertainment instead i will focus on the facts and the fact is this game bless online does nothing new seriously there is nothing innovative or new in this game if you were lucky enough to watch the various emissaries play bless on the japanese client servers you would have seen a game very similar in play style to ever quest you would have seen a very basic bare bones hot button smashing theme park orientated massively multiplayer online with zero style or flourish absolutely nothing sets this game apart from games from the a like ever quest or doc in fact speaking of these older games they were done better that saying something please stop throwing money at this project i cant call it a game because its more of a business excessive at this point as they keep re releasing it trying to make money we have to stop letting publishers and development teams treat us like idiots the a market wants a new massively multiplayer online but be wiz int providing us a new massively multiplayer online they re providing us with their fourth time recycled trash again the a market is full of people wanting a new massively multiplayer online but this int it look somewhere else
digital combat simulator was a rocky start for me but once i picked up a cheap joystick i got hooked live racked up most of my hours from this summer alone everything from flaming cliffs three to the a black shark and the classic a with so much more content on the way if you like military flight simulators this game is for you
business tour feels like an online multiplayer version of the classic board game monopoly pros free to play multiple settings for different types of games no gadgets quick min game and a teams cons in my experience winning a games seems very heavily dependent on which team rolls first i would like to see the rolls alternate sex blue red blue red rather than blue blue red red no team mode does not have an option to choose how many players you want per game one other person can join the lobby and press ready to make a two player match what if i want to play with three or four players game breaking glitches are very common sex player disconnects sometimes cause the game to freeze indefinitely leave game button not working getting randomly booted from games gadgets enable pay to win mode game is still very new and it can be hard to find a match especially in early mornings est edit along with the updates more bugs have been introduced even when you win the leave game button doesn't work done waste your time on this game
this game is fun to play with friends but it is also gay and highly in racist i swear it favor one person on the board the random picking is horrible because not once did anyone land on my property the whole game the world championships thing is in aids it needs to be nerved all in all this game is ninety luck a cant be a half darkie and play this game
best hunting game on the market as of the writing of this review in gonna warn you though live spent close to three hundred on this game so far and i still done own every items or equipment if you re not willing to pay done bother even downloading the game
early access review always felt that korean mos were far too gentle in their grind i always wanted to spend one hundred hours to build a simple top tier vehicle in a game let alone going for the big boy megabit and spend one thousand hours to build it ign so grind you cant have a life and do well its the ideal game
early access review was very happy to see that i played for over hrs and was having so much fun that i didst even notice has a nice challenge to it and nice pace love the storyline quests also
dreadnought is a really nice not to complicated game to play with friends playing on your own is a bit meh since there a lot of custards playing done expect any fleshed out story or cut scenes or anything pick a ship jump in a game and start blasting overall good its free smooth game players to learn hard to master lots of customisation options bad graphics are a bit disappointing waiting times for matchmaking sometimes really long
i done recommend this game anymore unless you enjoy becoming whale food incredibly pay town pay to win endgame player versus player meta is stale matchmaking is terrible too many ring elements loot rewards monsters abilities deus seem more interested in pandering to whales and cashing in on new monsters rather than balancing existing monsters
early access review its literally still on its alpha phase whats with the harsh critique from some well it has still a lot of things to be fixed but i think its still quite playable it runs well with some pcs live used as for the graphics i absolutely have no problem with it considering that i play the same games having the same go it has still problems with the audio like it disappears when you al tab during the loading phase though still can be fixed by doing so again for now ill recommend this game in its alpha phase more testers may produce better outcome of the game take note may May
early access review an online game that freely rewards you just for playing against a always deserves a positive review live played like one thousand and twelve hours on steam and maybe another two thousand and twenty five on my phone not much but in giving my point of view in a person who always expects a lot from a game if it doesn't fit my tastes then i quickly drop it after an intensive period of trial so first the negative points cons the collection is really extensive and the possibility to have in your deck four copies of a same card including legend aries makes me think this is not purely free to play the crafting system is unbalanced as we you cant disenchant a premium card for half the cost of making that same no premium card just for those of us who enjoy a complete collection without glowing things please take that as an advice please developers turn one guys you forgot to make up for the player who starts second resource differences here are maybe not essential and the blocking system seems fair but still the first player can have two or even three units on board in the second turn while the second player has nothing this int a con the resource system can sometimes make you lose a game yes but hey that why there are draw emblem cards to cycle and thin your deck and that why the game itself forces you to include a thirty three of power cards in a deck the old general rule in any classic card game what happens in hearthstone when you have an awful start while your opponent has a very good one pros pretty much anything else animations and graphics card design controls rules atmosphere a cheap and challenging way to try your skills and decks out against a and getting cards you can earn gold in gauntlet then spend it in forge free without having to play against experienced or pay to win players a huge bunch of mechanics making a crazy deck is really fun although ninety times it can be garbage a lots of game modes that got me so if you want some kind of complexity and a huge collection to complete mixed with intuitive mechanics and amazing tutorials try the game at least its free an easy eight hundred and ten maybe more
i done know where all this pay to win crap is coming from live been playing for two days and not spent a penny or felt like i had too you get enough crystals in game to top up on cards without the costs and even if you a decide to buy some cards you get crystals which get you other cards for free sooner the only gripe you could have is pay for cosmetics they cost you cash for pretty card sleeves simple answers if you begrudge that done buy them while there are plenty of in game expense traps none are vital to playing the game
man look at all them fake reviews trying to tell people that the game is at least decent unless are a gigantic whale from the get go then sure its a tiny bit enjoyable otherwise its not help ourself and just go
this has helped me through my stage eight terminal brain cancer i have finally seen how valuable human life is and how the afterlife is just a mere illusion through our own insecurities of death and how we may be forgotten a century after our death i have fully embraced the true meaning of life through this game in other words it has enriched and enlightened me as a whole because of me not just disregarding this as another web game i have accented to another philosophical plane this game has convinced me to empty out my bank account and go to a monastery in mongolia and become a monk my flight is in a week and after i write this review i will vow to myself to not use technology ever again so i can start being a monk in training thank you developers of laura clicker may
fun for a minute then its just repetitive if you want to work on a specific gun you have to go through every gun before it get experience points and possibly pay for some crap downloadable content just go in wikipedia it better than this crap
the game overall is fun and the character customization is nice but the problem is the server which sometimes cant load a game like when you re on the loading screen the game will stop there and it will take you back to the waiting area with your team but sometimes the game works and you can play fix the server and this game will be much better
this new update one hundred and twelve deploy drive wait for a re spawn has unfortunately made this game suck for everyone the new damage update makes every vehicle a god at absorbing bullets and shells even when destroying as many components as possible spawn camping is being encouraged now due to the maintenance timer only viable thing to do is run starter weapons if you get spawn camped the new driving physics makes cars go twenty kwh of road while getting catapulted to kwh on roads you never want to touch your brake button as that activates some sort of air lane level brakes that kill all your speed in a second cornering is impossible due to you power sliding round a corner when holding the gas you just not making the turn when just steering or doing a grandma where you drive round the corner with no speed at all the sound is broken now as well to the point where i cant pinpoint sounds anymore where before i could and of the tank physics good luck getting up hill mountains live been actively playing the game for two years now and i really enjoyed it before this update too bad they had to release this update in this form it has great potential but in its current state it is unplayable i done recommend playing this game right now
its sad how the game went from being my favourite game on steam to being the most toxic game that i can name out there in just little over a year its easily noticeable how toxic the community is it used to be so supportive but now all you see are twelve year old saying the same insults over and over again in pretty sure the deus know how bad the games current state is yet they fuel it with stupid taunts and extremely overpriced skins or constantly changing the me as i wish people still actually cared about this game more rather than trying to get leo in ranked
i played it once and it lost its magic you have to pay for more guns and after you've done one gun you've done them all its seems like a game that would be very cool but is very bland and they threw in the mini games to fix that but it didst help at all fun at first but has no replay value
early access review aircraft used to be my favourite free game on steam creative fun game play now though if you want to play rob craft you have to install a piece of third party software called ashanti cheat to play as far as i can tell ashanti cheat is a key logger and a screen capper that periodically posts both screenshots and chat logs from the game with an accompanying username to a public database each is flagged by most antivirus software and for good reason it is blatantly spyware that compromises users privacy i am deeply disappointed at the developers decision to carelessly disregard their users privacy and will not play rob craft or any other free am game again until i am allowed to play without downloading intrusive third party software sadly i cannot recommend this otherwise excellent game to anyone who cares about their privacy
this review is many years in the making i got involved and digital combat simulator about five years ago but just with in the last year i have gotten more serious in learning some of the aircraft i have purchased over the years its takes time and patience to learn each individual aircraft you need to study manuals and you need to do your own research i started with the a ten a attack jet but have become extremely attached to the of a lately and spend most of my time do fighting online this is by far the best sim out there nothing compares plane eleven is a clunker compared to this game i own plane eleven i have purchased several modules on steam but i play the game via the most up to date version off of the digital combat simulator website and i also use twenty with the nevada map looking forward to the new normandy map love this game well worth the five hundred or so i have invested so far plus justified a nine hundred and seventy gtd purchase a couple years ago see you in the skies ill be in your six
you'll simply have to realize that outside your circle of close data neck beard buddies who barely give two a about your mar despite the painstakingly long hours you've invested into it no one cares nobody when you win and raise your hands up and scream after making the biggest play of your irrelevant data career no one will join you in your triumph when you lose and scream in frustration your neck beard buddies will laugh that about it that data it leads to nothing it will give you nothing you'll lose the last few friends you have anymore some who wont be able to relate to and a handful who you'll lose to the game itself in the end you will try to convince yourself that the a hours staring at you through steam meant something but friend they done you have poured your heart blood sweat and tears into something that will never love you back and you will swiftly realize that you have degraded into that eerie bald man with the slowly rotating valve installed to the back of his head hesitantly turning to you you were the bald man the entire time too afraid to look at you destroying yourself over a meaningless video game
its an unfair game for example i played two rounds with my friend and i lost both times i landed on nearly every of my friends building and he nearly never landed on my buildings i done recommend this game at all the game is rigged
a really fun game that requires team work to accomplish macro goals and individual prowess to overcome the toughest of enemies am i proud of how much time live put into it no i wanna kill myself
just never ever worked and anyway be prepared to have to deal with at least twelve buttons just for missiles antimissile counterbalances radar anti radar flares it center i really tried the maximum to play this one really but no so sad edit it finally worked yeah what changed nothing just this time it worked done ask me why am just glad
early access review in disgusted by this company they have set a record they are thief i feel total robbed and steal they are disgusting company they have just give no information on their game they have cut almost all the content and features who were working total fine on their others version and these scammer call it early access with a cash shop they will just add back the content they have cut each twenty four month it was a cash grab they are working on nothing and added nothing others that a very bad skill rotation combat they were even unable release the action mode they have show in video for others that one class never buy this game that a pure cash grab by the most disgusting company i have ever see steam should remove this disgrace of scammer game from their store
early access review this game is smash bros but its not first of its many differences from smash bros is that your legend only starts with unarmed attacks these are weak but can be very fast attacks good for rabbit punches almost literally then you see a generic icon that looks like a flaming sword stuck in the ground this is a random weapon pickup spot if you grab this you will get one of your legends weapons which include spears guns dual daggers hammers rocket lances and swords these do more damage than your unarmed attacks some attack faster and more powerful than others now here is the equivalent of a special every character has two special attacks one with each weapon respectively some are ranged and some are close range the graphics are kind of cartoony and are really fun you can tell the deus had fun making this game there are also bombs one kind that explodes on contact one that is kind of like a sticky bomb that will explode when touched or after a certain time limit there is also a horn that summons your mech ironic valerie which flies in with a weapon and on fire hitting your enemies the music is fitting for the arenas and not bad and when you win or lose there is a chat box in which you can say good game or hacker or layaway pretty much whatever you want people just log out anyhow its still a good feature all in all i three three three three this game just apply for the beta just do it the only thing bad is that you have to pay for skins and taunts with girl money hopefully this will change in the future but for now its not really an obstacle good or you could give money to the deus to help add more characters and more arenas
world of guns is an amazing game that is the ultimate customize and the ultimate learner that should almost be a requirement however the music almost makes you feel a little like a really crazy person however this you can overcome by making a gun based off of you re country of origin on the gun the graphics should be updated to be more realistic and that all except the experience system which is almost stupid to unlock all of the guns but still this game should be played
twenty hours on personal computer and lost track on cell really like this game its good for passing time when working you can run in windows mode i just been playing way sick passing time and i guess i got stock in it again laugh out loud
no its not a pay to win because there no buying in game cash edit you can get all base ships for free and premium skins for micro transactions to or still not pay to win as ships all are balanced to each other expensive ship can be countered hard a early game ships
early access review installs game gets in a match buys a ump gets shot by overpowered so realizes how graphics are extremely horrible realizes how options are extremely limited realizes how sounds are extremely to steam library uninstalls for wasting time buys a lollipop and chills like a laws
i would recommend this game to everyone because its open world and is a massive multiplayer first person shooter with amazing graphics and stunning battle experience the one thing i love in this game is that it gives you the ultimate feel and experience of battlefield battles are huge and intense they give you adrenaline everyone should give it a shot at least once game is just fun and stunning
my friend introduced this game to me years ago when it was in alpha and i am proud to say that this little game has grown up to be a grind pay to win cash grab how that not even sega us soft and the likes could come up with such magnitude of genius grinding out weapons available to common soldiers during wii allowing users who play free to drive the most useless of wii vehicles such majesty
early access review think this game will be great but they really need to push for getting there low specs on for players to play this game it seem like the programs uses a lot of cup and hard on the graphic card few bugs but it is alpha wouldn't recommend for low specs computers instill they get the low spec graphics sort out but other then that i would recommend to a friend
early access review loved this game once now they ruined it had tons of weapons in storage because i liked to swap and build different bots now they are useless because i have to redraft things i already paid for before not to mention the total dumping down of game mechanics has made this such a boring game to play no thanks i am done with this game unless they fix it
you for this game i am really enjoying and i am finding all kinds of ways to be creative this game is really fun and enjoyable and i love the soundtrack gets me through building stuff
i really really want to love this game but i cant the concept graphics and scale are fantastic but overall the execution make it a mediocre first person shooter the combat feels clunky and no matter the settings the weapon feedback just feel completely disconnected from the mouse input like it was built around controller with the mouse being an after thought i done feel the technology is there for this to run as an first person shooter requires again no matter the settings used the frames just feels wrong and stutters further making the game feel clunky and disconnected in addition there appears to be significant de sync issues with cover being almost irrelevant as you may be behind cover on your end but on the other end you are not and continue to take fire when you shouldn't the unlock system breaks the game in a free to play first person shooter game it should be an unlock system that allows you to build classes to your play style however this is an upgrade system that makes you character better faster stronger causing balance issues finally it goes without saying but you will need a team for this one it is brutal for the solo player and even with a public group you will find yourself being stomped by more coordinated teams at the end of the day its free to play so by all means try it but i would strongly advise avoiding spending any cash on it i did and i regret it May
early access review do not waste your money on this you will get ten first person shooter no matter what spec you have combat is slow and clunky game have failed in multiple regions and they still haven fixed the first person shooter issue waiting on the queue for two thousand queue which is around twenty three hours then i ended up getting do when in about to get in and i have to re queue again horrible game horrible experience do not recommend
seven hundred data two changed i hate change i done like inviting people to my clubhouse to play only those with shared interest enough to learn if you cannot devote time to learn a game its nooks and crannies its negatives and positive nor embrace the community no matter how toxic they do not deserve to play data two valve and ice frog invited these strangers into our clubhouse for what gain a few cash a slice of the league of legends pie an icing of heroes of the storm all i can do is smile a bitter smile for data two our clubhouse has been invaded by casuals just like how casuals invaded the gaming scene their tentacles reach out and found its way here say hello to our casual overlords seven hundred is here to stay
i like games like this personally not for everyone but its nice to pass the time with only thing i would like is if the outfits and weapons came in a pack like the hair instead of having to pay for them separately and also make it cheaper if kept individual i would be more willing to actually buy them in support of the development overall a fun and simple game
early access review mao the game is soon gay yet soon manly sarah alabama it honestly the graphics replay and optimization are so good just add the customization optional commanding system it center and the game will become greater and please ban the cheaters because i done want to play another pub keep it up deus good luck
as with the original planet side this game had and still has massive potential also as with the original the primary flaw is that its purely player versus player even eve online has bots and that about as player driven as a game can be if no one is on or in the area you want to go no soup for you if everyone is there and you are outnumbered well prison sex cant be all that bad now can it
early access review good solid game at its core the deus just need to fix the problems that have persisted for some time such as ship too tips not displaying correct information and the glaring issues with crew creation i a explain what the hell crew skills do not pay to win yet and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right matchmaking needs a bit of work half the time you'll find yourself as a novice playing with against the top players on the leader boards but the core game play is decent and enjoyable if you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match or if you ever wanted to play world of tanks but in laugh out loud this is the game for you my one main issue the deus want thirty worth of platinum to buy one premium ship that is exactly the same as the original ship just re skinned with a pitiful ten exp credit booster that three times what the game cost at release god damn ridiculous for thirty i expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky expired boost spoiler you will bash your head on your keyboard after a match on occasion
early access review followed a naked guy into a house he had no pots and pans on him no weapon on his back fez kill apparently he knew i was following him so he got behind the door after he scared the irresistible sausages out of me i shot him like ten times on his last breath he fell with his knife on my chest we both died would eat irresistible sausages again
undoubtedly the best clicker game out there at its core you have tons of characters each of them interacting with others to create the perfect formation to fight waves and waves of enemies of different difficulty every single character has its own upgrades in the form of cards and the cards have their own upgrades and so on and so on basically you have tons of upgrades way more than your usual idle game it can go as far as feeling like an role playing game or even a strategy rather than an idle game especially if you check out the wiki page or any guide and there are many of course in the middle of it all are the chests which are your micro transactions you can buy them with real money as well as specific cards and bundles but crusaders of the lost idols is by no means pay to win pay to progress the player regularly receives codes for chests via email and there are plenty other ways to receive boosts without spending any money events the crusaders are filled with events on a regular basis far more often than any game idle or otherwise they agent different from your regular runs but the variety of characters you can acquire from them is certainly keeping the game fresh finally the community yes a community in an idle game moving on from the initial surprise the game has an in game chat mostly alerting everyone when someone gets an epic gear but also giving you the ability to ask questions or talk the day away given that the crusaders is not a competitive game the community is extremely friendly by far the best one i be encountered online i have observed people from all walks of life share their story through the chat and it is well beautiful no matter what type of gamer you are this is something you can easily play between chores or while doing literally anything working watching a movie playing another game i be enjoyed my fair share of idle games while doing tedious tasks and crusaders of the lost idols is definitely keeping it interesting being rewarding and a bit challenging to top it off
this game is awesome it has a manga style controls a easy to use its got player versus player for the competitive people quick lvi system secret dungeons motile chars for diverse game play a can play alone play with friends if i had any or play with complete strangers a can start a gild that have perks the lvi cap is a small sixty at lest right now and the mana pools a kinda small three hundred for each char but its so much fun just done be chung he is cheap unless a want to be cheap
early access reviewing played for one hundred games and most of those games i got either power screwed or flooded if its not the minimum seventy five cards deck it is probably because the card ring int good
it was good until i realized how overpowered the tier three russian things were the game has been out for so long and is still more broken than battlefield one beta this game is absolute trash and it deserves to be abandon by its players so maybe the deus will take some time and fix it
early access review kinda done recommend it because first there is a lot of hackers second they done have an anti cheat to keep those hackers away and third its just not really a fun game
so live played a few of the clicker style games and for some reason kept overlooking this one so finally i gave it a shot and live not looked back since starting off as a simple clicker game it quickly expands its scope adding on multiple modes of play new ways to progress and branching paths that give you options based on how you want to play want to just idle and not do anything there is a build for that want to click like crazy a build for that exists it has something for everyone
i think this game is not as bad as other people are saying yes it is a mobile port on first sight big buttons mobile like options menu but is this game bad or worse than world of tanks original no i must say no and here is reason why there are many things that world of tanks blitz is doing better for example friendly fire off so no idiots can kill you because they he don to like you friendly collision is off if your friend or just another player ram you you will not get damage you don to have to buy modifications for tank like turrets newsletter engine there are no artillery tanks in the game i think it makes world of tanks blitz better in my opinion when you get on tier three my can put you into match on a lot a lot better and bigger maps where you can use both strategy and environment map design before tier three i was putting on not so well looking maps or interesting but after tier three maps get bigger and a lot uninteresting places and unique map bad i must say this i played wot wot is a lot better looking however my personal computer is so i cant play wot anymore so yes you get it graphics a rent great however it is more good for bad pcs twenty million fifty two thousand and seven graphics is excuse me if there are mistakes or errors in the text
do not waste your time on the tank mode of this game you will be on spotted in any tank you choose except the later tiered russians of courses many bugs and glitches like invisible bombs falling from the sky with no indication and no planes on the minimal was playing in a tiger a and i drove about ten meters away from an enemy tiger ii a i shot him directly in the cheeks of his turret on green green indicating you can penetrate and it bounced russian tanks are overpowered and can practically one shot any tank which makes playing any other line pointless and not fun at all battle royal battle rating is absolutely de tier three tanks with forty battle rating gets placed in tier five tank matches with seventy eight battering paid fifty for golden eagles which got me to tier three glitchy repairs the timer resets randomly sometimes even if you done get shot or anything so you'll be on a minute repair it gets down to like twenty and then it resets and goes to a minute again you can get one hotshot from across the map literally be careful going twenty five feet away from spawn you can and will get yup no spawn protection no cover you can literally spawn and be on spotted the list goes on and on with bugs and glitches that they done fix honestly its a waste of time they refuse to fix these glitches and bugs and i heard somewhere that they were going to buff the russians the now i done know if that true but damn planes is a lot nicer but its boring
early access review this game is really fun i have been playing pub but this just brings a whole new world and concept into the game i am hoping that this game slowly becomes bigger and more well known since its soon fun just hope the sweaty players stay out of here and keep to pub and footnote there is a problem with force now where the game automatically looses connection after about five hundred and ten min of game time and quits the game it would be really nice if this problem was fixed quickly
early access reviews end more time on adventure quest worlds please be this game is good but for twenty eighteen it cant compete with other big game you guys a rent getting new players they re just old adventure quest worlds player so please spend more time improving adventure quest worlds
early access review servers are in complete garbage and they most likely wont ever get any better id recommend not getting into it for the servers alone not going to mention all of the problems with the mechanics in the game
game took too long to instal and when i was done with the instal it launched the launcher i clicked play the loading screen came up and then it diapered and never opened i waited min for it to open and it didst so i uninstalled to get from main website and steam didst get rid of all the files and i could it find them all it wont instal the game whatsoever now the steam would not recommend steam smite to others go download it from the office website
this is a great mindless game to have on half of a screen while doing other things i do prefer the mobile version better because of the lack of graphics settings in the personal computer version this game might get boring after achieving the maximum two hundred people can take up to a couple months depending on how often you play
all you kab am haters i feel you live been playing this since some of the early public builds and live seen a fare share of stupidity on the part of deus build seventy nine was the last time i played coop dungeons they took stat pots out of god lands and learning to solo dungeons with any character was a game changer for me personally play to win no all the cash you spend int gonna get you any better at the game despite all the loot you purchase were all seen news die horribly with tops a stock new with purchased tops wont hold a candle to a maxed character with mid tier gear and they done officially sell stat post items in game so that swag is up to the player not the wallet after lvi twenty with any character your top priority is stat pot acquisition yes it can be a grind and permanent death is real but this game would be junk without permanent death my advice lay down the one thousand and twenty bucks on a extra character slot and some storage chests you will die lots you will crap keyboards sideways and you will quit perhaps even forever but you could also kick pets made this game so easy anyway that i will agree with some people it was a better realm under wild shadow but i still recommend it to anyone wanting to flex their skills and strut their gear
not enjoy my time with it bills itself as the most generous card game but the majority of rewards are gated behind watching twitch streams and that suddenly stopped working for me one day and support never got back to me
early access reviewing played this game enough now to not recommend it to anyone to deck mode happens too often the game has a poor future because it is actually too free to play the designers fail to post patch notes most of the time cards are buffed or nerved with no explanation or the explanation makes no sense communication from the designers is sarcastic brief to the point of little information and uses invokes far too much
i love taking things apart to see how they work so for me this game has been amazing the models are highly detailed the controls are smooth and easy to grasp and the range of guns to choose from keeps growing by the day this is a fun little time aster the kind of game which you log in to for maybe a few minutes each day to fiddle around in in having a blast so far and would highly recommend this game
early access review its the combat from eve online framed in team fortress two matches class oriented objective based and slower paced and strategic full three dimensional movement that also allows for viable use of cover effective use of your star ship class learning to recognize enemy silhouettes and teamwork is critical and i love all of it very well executed the game play feels balanced for early access and the aesthetics hint at an interesting setting like titan fall in a little hooked
once upon a time i was playing multiple facebook games on a daily basis sometimes for hours one was a farming game an aquarium fish breeding game and another a cafe running game one day it suddenly dawned on me that in all of these games i was doing the same things over and over and over with no end in sight no real goals and ultimately no point i would just build up my farm aquarium or cafe to make money to build more make more money build more act act act fallout shelter gives me the exact same feeling it is a decent game i guess can be somewhat addictive but there is ultimately no point to it its just a non productive waste of time ultimately i have decided to uninstall it maybe now ill spend time on a game that has an actual point to it maybe ill just read a book instead
this game has so much potential not play it much but already see that it could be a rival game to some company needs to add some more features tho and tuning of vehicles if not in game like i said not played it much laugh out loud please bring a drifting feature in would be epic
trove is an amazing awesome game the mobs that i battle everyday to level up and protect the world from evil shadows of darkness the graphics are great everything is great play with your friends craft build explore and trove is so awesome that its free
early access review really good free to play game nice graphics smooth and easy handling really nice graphics recommend to anyone who bought pub and was disappointed by the game engine
a fun game to kill some time but also useful in the real world a guy pulled a gun on me once and i bet him i could disassemble the gun and put it back together in record time intrigued he gave me the gun i shot him and ran
pay town game with overpowered trap cards and no cards to counter them or rather very few that are locked behind hundreds of dollars that you need to spend so if you plan to be a free play player look for something else also enjoy the bamboo burn meta going on right now if decide to play this game
good game solid combat not as grind or ring ridden as most quest games overly cute and the character skill class progression system gives this game a really high replay value this game is also no where close to pay to win for those who are willing to learn the game there also a character class that fits all types of players styles stamina bar is a real pain though there is no reason why a game should limit players on how long they play a game period anyone who says other wise is simply making excuses and trying to damage control for a system that hurts the game more than it helps it
never winter is the son of wow and the brother of term term and a huge number of brothers and sisters graphics are okay user interface is great very important for massively multiplayer online role playing game combat system is classical atmosphere is epic the difficulty is fine tuned neither too easy nor to hard if you done wanna spend one hundred and fifty bucks per year in wow free to play never winter is really worth playing
early access review would only play this game if i was held at gunpoint holding myself at gunpoint to play this game with my buddies is cancer id have more fun eating rains out of an old mans swamp the medina is broken and the kills done come easy its a game for try hard rain eaters
early access review the combat system in this game beyond crap bitterly spam the dam key to do attack and just doesn't feel fluent at all for having a descent personal computer kinda stupid that barley get sixty first person shooter on not the greatest graphics either when other games with better graphics i can get one hundred first person shooter which kinda sad
this is so terrible it makes me cry myself to sleep at night you cant shoot anything unless you pay for membership so basically you just walking around collecting deer she until you find one that you cant kill the only good thing is the wacky animations that made me and my friends laugh of and if you shoot a tree a blood cloud appears
early access review okay so i started playing lotto as a teenager but it went south for me when they started letting you buy levelled characters live been searching for a replacement massively multiplayer online role playing game since aqua three dimensional is really really good for being in its early access stage it can be improved but its enjoyable i killed a good three hours without even realizing it however some things i would like to see guild clan options where members can create a guild and bring friends together in a permanent setting you can always see when your guild members are nonlinear group options where groups of five hundred and twenty people can come together for big battles temporary able to disband but share kills experience points and looters gingham options org please some kind of chat system that allows people within groups clans parties or even just friends to have separate private conversations a friend and i were trying to make a plan of attack and someone else kept butting in options from clicking on a person as it is you have to go to the top of the screen and click on their name in lotto i could just right click their avatar in front of me a map that shows you where you are where quests are or what direction to go ina slightly longer re spawn time the creatures re spawn so fast that sometimes they gang up on you in sure these are all things the deus are planning to get to anyway but this is my two cents these are the improvements id like to see
early access review so far bless for me has been fun a bit of a rocky release to the early access version for us in steam but i still enjoyed the last couple days playing is bless the best massively multiplayer online of two thousand and eighteen no of gosh no there is no best massively multiplayer online in two thousand and eighteen done be silly am i go a cry about the release issues no that is not how adults should act unlike them spoiled streamers i will however watch the deus clean up their mistakes and continue to play the game for fun with my friends do i think a lot of work needs to be done on our version they released of heck yes and unlike a lot of the community here on steam i believe in time they will get the game up to how they intended it to be released do i think it is a cash grab no i came from black desert online where you must pay to ring i feel in bless i can comfortably buy the base game and not feel like i have to spend one thousand five hundred to catch my breath getting to where i feel i should be done take this as comparing to do i love do i still play the game so far in the game i see a few positive things one being their actual player base everyone who did not refund and still is actively playing the game is so warming the community in game is not toxic like other mos i have talked to many players by just exploring the game and they were cool people so thank you spoiled brats for refunding your games bless doesn't need your salty attitudes cd i have had fun doing the ave aspect of bless and taming every thing the most so far i find it is a fresh massively multiplayer online that everyone who enjoys having a role such as healers or tanking should try bless and not just for five minutes and say what everyone else thinks honestly try it as if it was a brand new massively multiplayer online try it with the knowledge that it is not perfect but nor is any human on this fri ken planet so remember this not best gamer of but he said she said this streamer said but the reviews no just no your an adult or should be if you re reading this so us act like one and play it the way you want to if you done like it then that is a you problem not the deus problem i have high hopes of bless not failing as much as it is a older game and our release want up to standards it is still an enjoyable game to play i wouldn't play it seriously as in competitively or wanting perfection
pay to win game no vehicles have to purchase licences pros looks icons pay membership fee no vehicles have to buy licenses cant find urea could have done better do not recommend this game not worth the install one thousand and ten
early access review if you are a big fan of super smash bros then you'll like this game too the game play is like sub and the champions to use is like league of legends where you get a free champion rotation and can buy other champs with in game money you earn through playing matches its a cool game for a quick solo battle and great with friends you can pick from different maps change the colour of your champ and buy skins for them too
early access review played mtg a lot years ago when de leagues were still a thing been waiting for like ten years now leagues are back but its purely new promoted sets and no casual fun enter eternal its all i ever wanted from magic only with stone earths nice us the same depth and an actual option of grinding cards and tax for free a well executed game from end to end in gonna toss some money on it just to say thanks for the fun but unlike other tags its all up to me what a brilliant gem one thousand and ten
some kid invited me to play this and the only reason i downloaded this game was to recruit him and brainwash him to join my merry and of morons that complain about the price of a packet of cigarettes and the fact that no girl wants us because we have a big soul pole that hurt their jay jay
i love this games here a few thoughts why pros massive scale with infantry vehicle and air combat mixed in looking for small fights you find them on the less occupied lanes looking for several hundreds of players in one spot your covered as well as a new player you start with the best weapon for each class every other weapon is just a side grad example medics are intended as supports and get a rifle that effective close to medium range but you can unlock through in game currency or real money your choice rifles that are better at hip fire and so in close range but less effective in medium and long range you re an average or good shooter you'll get tones of in game currency to unlock what you want fast your a bad shooter you re still covered either through using your skill to get close to enemies with light assault jet packs or invisibility from the infiltrator and one shot them from behind there are certain weapons for that or by supporting as medic and engineer or by deploying mobile spawn points or by playing artillery as a tank holding down show points from afar and raking in kills and assists that way pro con outfits outfits are like guilds in any other massively multiplayer online being in on makes planet side shine nothing greater than winning a fight while being outnumbered three to why that here and not in pro getting in one as a new player is confusing there are some outfits that just want to be big and invite every new player they find but then you are in an outfit that most of the time hast several hundred or thousand inactive players and no leadership and organisation fun factor equals zero so then without the game telling you how you need to leave the outfit and find a new one if you have experience in mos its easy but otherwise you got no clue since the game does not lead you i love to unlock stuff games were i got everything bore me most of the time planet side has at the moment a really nice pace for unlocking stuff it takes me around twelve hours to unlock the most expensive stuff at one thousands in game currency and i am a medium good player meaning i have friend who are just half as effective and those who are way faster you cant unlock class and vehicle upgrades with money that is for me a good thing but others will be discouraged because there are some neat side grades for the vehicles and classes that take tones of time to unlock since generally the first and with tier are the only noticeable ones the in between sadly done matter most of the time on the other hand does that mean new players are compete tiv from the start you can buy weapons implants boosts and cosmetics with real money i like that you want something now buy it not necessary but helps especially when you start the game as a long time player you now how to make certs in a fun way and when as a new player that hard and so buying sometimes help to have fun personally i started buying first after a few hundred hours as i noticed i want to stick to the game the graphics still look really nice on the highest setting but i personally can hit with all the light effects and recommend some of the optimization guides on youtube or elsewhere helps a lot with first person shooter and you get for kills cause the other guy has nicer effects but you get the kill cause you can see him cons you need a relative strong new personal computer to run the game with high graphic settings and decent first person shooter construction it is part of the game they infested much time in but it is not good at the moment in short you can build player made structures of all kind and have really awesome battles there just there no reason the only reason up to now was a building generating victory points but this building is so extremely easily killed max crash google it if interested that building a real base was a waste of time so you try to exploit the terrain and make it hard to reach with out building much else at all and then go somewhere else problem is you could defend against said max crash but front lines are shifting and building a base right at the front is suicidal because building defence takes time and either the enemy rushes you or the front got pushed away by your allies worst part enemies tend to ignore your base because you get near to nothing for attacking it same for the defenders you get near to no points for standing there and waiting implants the only possible pay to win aspect of the game is it game breaking no since if you re the better shooter or surprised them or outnumber them or you sit in a rocket shooting aircraft while hes on the ground you you drop a grenade mine or a before his feet or it doesn't matter especially in the big fights that make planet side so great but in a small scale battle with even skill its slightly annoying as a new player just by playing you get a random selection of tier one implants the higher tier is five you get more implants by winning alerts player triggered in game events and you get the second currency needed to upgrade those problem tier two three a rent worth anything the bond compared to tier one are minimal tier four costs nine hundred is per implant and is a real upgrade you get one hundred is per won alert fifty for second place and thirty for last place at best you could earn around one hundred is per hour but that unrealistic and tier five costs around two thousands is the tier five bonus is significant thou so too why pay to win an example are the implants battle hardened reduces flinching while getting hit and assimilate you get shields back by killing someone with head shots on tier five battle hardened gives you fifty reduced flinch from enemy fire same as tier four but on a kill that bonus is doubled making it easier to aim afterwards because you have just recoil to compensate for assimilate on tier five replenishes two hundred from your five hundred shields after a head shot kill and recovers thirty of your current special energy healing for a medic jet packs for a light assault over shield for a heavy and invisibly on an infiltrator you can buy crates that hold additional implants which you can trade for is these crates can be bought for three hundred in game currency for a small one you should never do that bad trade or for seven hundred and fifty in game currency takes me as an average player around ten hours to earn or you pay for them with real money for a random loot box meaning more money dumped equals a higher chance of getting the implant you want and having the resources to upgrade them
a common complaint about video game with firearms in them is the they a rent realistic enough this game changes that this is less of a video game and more of a gunsmith training aid every firearm contained is a real life weapon the mechanics of how they work and how they come apart and go back together is accurate ever wanted to see exactly how your favourite weapon in your favourite first person shooter actually works this game is your answer that being said the guy is a little clunky at times and outside of getting achievements the first person aspects are not great none of this really really detracts from this little gem of a game
live played it for hand all i have seen until now is run into a generic dungeon building ignore all trash obs attack the boss at the end of the building kill the boss and take the loot leave the building and search for the next dungeon that looks exactly the same repeating cube world at least the dungeons were random generated and interesting every character has three attacks there are no different weapon types please tell me there is more to this game i haven seen yet
whether you like dispensing freedom and democracy or instead prefer getting your cheek breeks i a dam i on this game has something for everyone if you re not a filthy casual that is
if league or data are too slow paced for you and you done like the top down perspective then smite is the game for you with a character roster that more interesting game play that faster and requires more skill and a company that has shown time and time again that they care about their player base its the best mob on the market
before this update i would rate the game nine hundred and ten after this update i give it two hundred and ten the main problem is not what they added but what they removed if they only would of kept the valve quick play pub servers a ton of players would not have had a problem with the update but by removing these servers they forced players to use the new casual system and let me tell you it is not casual some of the things we lost i will list below you can not just look for a valve pub server to join quick any more you have to join a que to play on the valve servers this que can take up to four to ten minutes to get in for me if you want just one map expect to wait even longer they removed some maps that were in the rotation before this update after one side wins you get to go through it all again because you just cant keep playing without queuing up again yes people will say go play the community servers but ninety of them are trash the rest usually have two hundred and forty seven of the same map or done have players on the maps you want to play so until valve corrects this i cant bring myself to give this a thumbs up
i done like the time you need to have in order to play this game even though its free can be fun but at some point a pain in the a in other reasons i done recommend this to anyone who doesn't have the time still not going to recommend it just because you constantly have to stop playing a game just to see if you've been attacked need more water or food supplies i will keep playing this from time to time but ill never understand how to play the game in a fun way because i done think there is i done recommend this
in a nutshell ginormous talent tree with infinite path variety pocketed items with similar but even better than final fantasy seven material mechanic combinations for skills creation imagination is the limit what diabolo should really be
early access review actually like this game its not bad to its core it just has a lot of issues that need to bet dealt with the servers need ping counters the connection on every in server is horrible this is the only game where having a bad connection helps you win the weapons seem horribly unbalanced or maybe that me just getting killed and having to wait five seconds for the lag to catch up i just cant play it the gun play is great but without a solid connection and horrible balance its just hidden under some
early access review if you ever watched space movies for the battles between ships get this game its affordable and worth more than is being asked edit had a chance to play a bit more and in very impressed imagine a mix between allegiance and leave of legends with a little star wars space physics to keep things light and focused on the ships and abilities which are varied and specious the game is like five right now but it or else god doesn't love you anymore
this game is a terrible personal computer port from a mobile game the controls are basically you clicking the buttons instead of tapping them on a phone disadvantages rap framers terrible dragon clips for the movie
awesome game at first i downloaded it to see if it was any good and of boy the animations are really well done the due lists voices are great and you done have to spend anything to build a cool deck and smash your enemies the online duelling is pretty quick and at least i have found opponent almost instantly every time also i have a great time playing as kaaba hes just so mean add push alt enter to go full screen there no option to do so in game
note the hunter is a niche game its a wonderful niche game done get me wrong but other than the game play itself i have nothing but issues with it compare this game to the big name games out there cod bio shock far cry sky rim and so forth ignore the genre production value and sales are what in comparing here in all of these big name games have one thing in common you buy the game you can play it all of it you unlock gear and items as you play through you done have to buy additional junk just to complete mission progress through the game occasionally you will have expansions or a dons more downloadable content that you can buy that will in most cases extend the game play but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind so ill take cod one of the best known most loved and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry i think i paid sixty when it first came out that was it for the whole game all equipment all levels and weapons attainable for that sixty of i forgot to mention that you own the game at that point you done have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content now the hunter free to play no its not misti led its deceptively titled the free to play portion contains one rifle one scope a bleat call a camera a gas and binoculars of that fine and all but you only get to hunt one animal mule deer on one reserve if anything its a free demo if you expect to see the rich content in this game forget it this demo is nothing more than a snapshot of so that what you've gotten for free lets spend sixty on this game like we would any other and see where it gets us forty five for one year basic and another fifteen for three more months that it that what you get i would love to say that you get more but you done you get fifteen months with no additional gear no additional weapons of you do get the option to hunt on all the reserves you also it the licences to hunt all of these animals but you still cant because you haven bought the proper weapons proper ammo proper equipment so you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out sixty for fifteen months of play time whats that did i just hear someone squeak the words world of war craft denied wow at least gave you access to all of its content after you've paid your subscription and no in not going to complain about the subscription as wow is was an massively multiplayer online gotta maintain those servers yeah i know the hunter has multiplayer big deal out of the twenty people who enjoy multiplayer the hunter could loose all twenty of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only you guys want to make more money add the cottontail and a crappy shot gun to the free to play version and call it a free demo sell the game for thirty and monthly membership of five make gear and weapons unlock able get rid of the micro transaction garbage i would buy this game for thirty i would pay a five subscription if i had access to all of the games content after i made those purchases that at least thirty five you guys would have made from my first month five and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription however due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game live spent fifteen for the subscription had my fill because i refuse to spend more money on trivial and temporary purchases and that it you've made fifteen from me and you wont make any more i done recommend this game sure download it shoot a few mule deer and call it quits for the price you'll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases this game int worth the disk space it occupies even with wow purchased when it was released and played for the first year at about one hundred and eighty is still cheaper than this you want a good hunting game play cod or far cry or bio shock you get to hunt people and monsters you get tons of weapons to choose from you done have to pay a monthly subscription and your purchases are yours to keep done spend a dime on this game
really good game for a free to play but your options are too limited on what a can do if a done put any money you have just a few slots to save items so a can keep it on other characters or if your character die good weapons also need money and it is annoying having taken something good and dying and losing all your progress some more things for free would be good
early access review really liked this game before the update classes were what made this game different and it was really interesting to explore the different classes and having everyone on your team have different skill sets now that they've removed it its too similar to major games such as footnote and though i do like the skin option classes should come back i will continue to play this game but i would not recommend at least not until they bring back classes if they bring them back i also hope they add more skins as this gives more opportunity to have unique players however i will say the graphics have improved quite a bit so good job on that
i voted not recommended house the developers done care about the cum unity and after i spender tons of gold the game docent move on no new stuff or even fixes for the game there is so much that needs improvement and they just done care i wish i could have all my many back house it was a complete waste at this rate this game will lose all players and will die if any development read this stop using our many in or shit cars or buying houses and improve the game
this game int bad but hope you never need the help of a pm i was introducing a new player into the game we both were ejected from the server at the same time we log back in shes stuck in the terrain as in nothing but black around here we try stuck kill me log in out nothing works we submit a ticket we wait we wait we wait we go find something else to do and we are auto logged off we come back seven hours later shes still stuck so either we have to sit there and make sure we done auto log off to get help that not happening or seven hours later they still have no unstuck her that a wonderful way to sell a game needless to say we are going to play a different game
early access review worst game of the century here do i start the graphics in this game are disgusting the game play its self is so bad i considered whether the developers were just making the game to make a cheap buck or they had just given up on making games halfway through making this the worst game of the century done download oriente reviews
so far not good took ages for the server to load started on a beginners server stepped onto the map and was immediately shot by another player from a sniper position then had to wait three minutes before i was allowed to re spawn or pay for immediate re spawning cant be bothered with that
early access reviewed it sixty one thousand four hundred and eighteen please read this before reading below in not going to delete my past review i meant it when i wrote it but my opinion has changed since i no longer recommend this game the developers do not listen to the community let me start by saying when the content creators the company chose can no longer be silent and they are making content about the giant flaws you know its not looking good at first we asked for more content in response we got a player versus player okay cool a promise for more content coming soon cool and do a massive damage nerf across the board what ill get back to that later there were people duping items and people making ridiculous amounts of gold off of easy to farm materials that had a price that was literally a higher than other materials these players ended up getting a major leg up on other players before these issues were fixed but their gold and items seemed to still remain there were rumours these players got anywhere from a three hundred and fifteen day ban all the way to their accounts were deleted regardless of what actually happened to them this left the market in a terrible spot trading was introduced it doesn't work and want mentioned in patch notes we found it accidentally but back to class balancing the balancing after the first large nerf was shaky and it seemed like they were just letting loose reckless adjustments not slight ones either hoping that it would hit the mark and solve the problem rangers got a ridiculous amount of cdr on skills berserker trashed guardians nerved paladins left with spitball damage and nothing but an inconsistent cd combo chain and a heal and so on some of us thought that getting our hands on current end game gear would help compensate for these nerds but that ended up being a dream that was swiftly crushed players started getting to max level forty five and realized that the drop rates for the purple grade level fort five gear are very small something close to five that sounds bad but its worse once you realize its five just for a random class gear piece with a random rune slot to be shared by the whole party we were told this was intentional not a bug these gear pieces dropped from the level fort three and fort five dungeons the level fort three dungeon was insanely difficult post damage nerf there is a bug that can cause infinite mobs to spawn if you wipe in a certain spot final bosses enrage timer is notorious beating this is the only way to get master crafting quest done the fort five dungeon is easier than the forty three not even worth mentioning but these dungeons can only be accessed twice a day which means your grind for this purple gear is even more limited since then we have been begging for end game drop rates to be fixed crafting materials to drop so we can craft blue grade level thirty even arm or we couldn't even get the material to craft it which meant constantly running the level thirty even dungeon until you got your entire set as drops runes boost gear stats to not all break on ave death instead we got a new world boss and a silent nerf was not mentioned in the patch notes that took the set bonus from the level fort five purple grade gear and spiked it into the ground i brought up this ninja nerf in the official discord and i was banned from talking because i was spreading rumours about the game but other players started noticing and confirming the level fort five purple gear nerf and some of the officials in the discord went silent now you might ask why are you upset a new world boss that the content you had asked for in the beginning well optimization is still non existent silent nerds are a terrible business practice and the world bosses drop trash unless you re extremely lucky there a lot more i had high hopes be wiz would turn things around i tried to keep an open mind and embrace it as early access but its obvious they done care this is going to be a very long post ill start my review by saying this yes i recommend this game i find the pieces that make it fun outweigh those that drag it down if you re looking for an incredibly well polished experience with perfect translations this is not the game for you here are pros cons recommendations for the developers and a discussion pros fun combat the combo system feels nice limo very fun player versus player a guild mate and i accidentally started a faction war in an open area last night and spent two hours laughing while we and the union zeros kept going at it taming system is really fun nothing like riding a giant caterpillar into battle large world dungeons are fun mix between ave and player versus player is well done not pay to win crafting and gathering is a rather smooth experience regardless of what everyone else is saying the deus are trying they just issued a public apology for the rough start and have been very on top of fixing issues that alone is a pro that most people done give credit for yes its their job but so many other early access games almost never make it to a full release and leave their product dead and unfixed so props there cons poor optimization this can be easily fixed by editing an in i file the fixes are all over geddit its not hard to find very poor translations servers are somewhat unstable supposed to be fixed during this maintenance market board is buggy i would be more forgiving on this point if there were trading or another way to trade sent items to friends and guild mates but currently it involves one person posting an item on the market board for the minimum value allowed a few minutes of waiting the receiver trying to grab the item before someone else does but the search doesn't always work so its means spamming to try and get the item to show up to even figure out if its posted some parts of the game haven been implemented yet see recommendations and discussion recommendations build on the guild experience add a guild chest guild house it center more content for us to do as a group add way for us to help out other guild members with gear instead of trying to go to the market place at the same time and one of us trying to scoop up whatever the other just posted for as cheap as they can post it accelerate the addition of existing content we have gear dropping for assassin mystic but done have the classes also we have dungeons for the current level cap that done drop loot because of this there no incentive to do those dungeons we also have level for unlocking the last two skills traits content beyond level forty five and other pieces of the game that i would love to experience but they are still unavailable discussion as mentioned in the pros the pipe balance is done well it will only get better as content is added i am shocked that so much of the community dove into a game that is labelled as early access bought a founders pack to get a head start in early access early early access and are raging about the imperfections yes the game has been released in three other regions it should be at least more well optimized but that also means we knew what bugs to expect if they a rent fixed on the other regions why would they bring us the game all polished and not bring it to the other regions first where these players have been waiting also regarding the server issues i personally feel as though they didst expect some of the larger streamers to bring attention and more people to this game causing queue times and full servers they are even being very lenient on refunds for people who are absolutely unsatisfiable that a great move by them honestly old there are problems its early access its to be expected but i like this game a lot so far and cant wait to see how it improves with time
a a laugh out loud click ate din all seriousness this game is fun once you get good at it so i a it thumbs up
early access review thought i would really like this game and i really did you see i put did that because i realized that there are so many hackers in this darn game every demo game i join there would be a hacker with a auto grenade launcher with unlimited ammo or a auto role playing game with unlimited ammo it really sucks when you cant even come close to win a game when someone is cheating like that would like if there was a banning system or a anti cheat program involved would make the game a lot better in so many ways besides that every other game mode is perfectly fine and i think this game is amazing besides the fact of hackers would strongly recommend
early access review the game seems fun but the twice promotion is one of the worst executed advertisement live seen if you re going to attract new players who might have played other card games done make them sit through a very long unstoppable tutorial i played through the tutorial and because of a verification issue had to re log and was made to start the tutorial all over this completely killed any drive i had to try your game there should really be a button to skip the tutorial the fact that this int in a game in this day and age is baffling
there is only one word that i can say to describe this game box this is definitely one of my top five games to play list the realism is amazing the physics are great the use of the ultra low graphic settings makes this game absolutely playable on a laptop max first person shooter i got for this game was forty even first person shooter definitely get this game
if you like dial style games and sorting through massive piles of loot to see if there anything worth equipping you re gonna like this a lot add in the fact that its free and the things in the cash shop are entirely cosmetic and optional and you really cant go wrong
the game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring every one hundred rooms floor there are generally two or three stuff happening a big room which is actually multiple rooms with spooky stuff a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor and some notes left by some dude for you to read otherwise you re just walking through the same rooms over and over sometimes you think a room is important but its actually just a regular room with nothing special of and jump scares but when you re not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas hopefully its free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you re wondering if you re not paying the game with your time
early access review for the first fifteen months this game used to be incredibly fun i hit master in ranked and draft after i got the first competitive decks built the free to play aspect is extremely fair you constantly get new cards to improve your library some color have been more dominant than other time because of their incredible wide access to game winning mechanics car draw ramp under costed legend aries like sand storm titan but the meta was still fairly diverse and since there weren't as many sets it is normal for a new card game to not have certain deck types enabled while others will be more reliant combo is mid range for examples i was expecting the deus to address these issues but they actually managed to do the exact opposite time got by far the most playable in the new set they got improvements in almost all areas bigger creatures more consistent ramp and the marked allowing for an even more consistent three turn threat it got to the point where the entire meta is basically only time decks whoever is responsible for the development of the time faction should get fired seriously what in the world are you guys thinking it forces people to basically play removal piles and they still cant manage the never ending armada of threats time plays there is no thought required to build a ranked deck just slap all the time playable together and hurt burr you will win no synergy no concept just get the big ops as quick on the board as possible and do to think about it the deus did all the thinking for you when they threw all the mechanics on the cards for you where other factions have to work to get their synergies working add certain cards to grind through your deck maybe even a tutor time just has it inherent in their cards creatures with card draw on power drop creatures with removal included creatures with global flyer lock just throw them together and you have this game figured out i was looking forward to the new expansion but after a week of facing the same exact deck and reviewing the designs i am one hell of a salty customer that is turning away from your product too bad i really liked the game up until this point but with as little foresight and understanding of meta balancing that the deus showed with their newest stick i know enough to see where this game is going nowhere
probably the best game in existence it would be min craft or footnote but this is the one i prefer especially because of the candy biome i love that one cd and in this game the lurex want taken like other stupid games my little brother tries to steal the controller but i done let him hama also it runs on my laptop so i play it under the covers after bedtime so my mum doesn't beat me laugh out loud
access review instead of trying to completely reinvent the battle royal wheel ring of elysium does enough to set itself apart amidst a streamlined polished and fun take on the genre
i lost leadership of my clan because i took a break from this game the leadership transferred to some random guy in the clan i spent more than two years building up my clan from scratch and it is all taken away from me i contacted support and they wont do anything about it lower move bullshit system
early access review a thirty five game for sure pros wii shooter free to play the scale of the war and the fact that it is entirely dynamic having a good game in this game leaves you feeling especially satisfied cons shooting and movement feels extremely clunky see drunk nikon and roman the sound of the guns is ephah massive amounts of grinding required to get anything interface could be better in short if you like wii games and have some spare time you might find this game an amusing distraction
early access review the game want bad at the start it was really nice getting use to the switch combos was the hard part of the game then i got banned because i was using a outside program i have no out side programs so i got banned for no reason on that one wasted seventy even hours on this game to get wrongfully banned contacted customer support and that so far hast been worth it cant even get a response
so when you first start this game you think noah so much content but usually it only takes about a few months to get literally everything in the game this is why you only see new players the people who have played this game for so long usually quit after a few weeks because its easy to accomplish so much kind of like sky rim if you play it a lot without mod but i like this game because people who are new to massively multiplayer online role playing game games can learn from this even though the interface is differently the time you see this review in probably still working my way up too my goal my goal you ask in trying to complete everything like every portal boss dungeon get every gear highest level with all classes every mount etc have faith in this game and i hope to reach my goal and when i do i will vow to help every person ever also even though i only had fifty minutes into this game i am on like portal nine
early access review done have a lot of hours into this and i almost never write reviews but this game is a lot of fun i have played a lot of pub and tbs i like this game better looks better feels better and plays better and i mean who docent wanna pull a drive by on a hang glider with a eagle
great game its like a better version of the james us of love the sound affects i just wish they had made the cannon on the a a just a little bit more powerful did a straining run on a tank six times and the tank was still alive
early access review must admit i was really surprised to see all the negative remarks about this once great game how ever they are all right they have completely screwed this game up progression is completely gone they have turned this game in to a complete pile of crap after playing a few match over the last month too add the game has zero balance game breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed pay to win heavy and saggy as heck do not give these greedy deus anything till they fix this pile of jun as of july tenth nope just nope let the its support this trash there is no balance at all levels going up against level one hundred bots laugh out loud pointless i started a new account just to test to see what kind of bots i ran into by the time i hit level twenty i was going up against bots the size of my main account each level you get more cup more cup equals bigger stronger parts which is one hundred one hundred and fifty is cap weapons that basic one shot you over and over and over the only thing the match maker does is put player in a game this is no tier or level grouping no balance at all then there the weapons laugh out loud tesla are a boobs best friend require zero skill and basic instal kill anything they run into and of course done forget the lag your dead before you even see what hits you i am so very sad this is the current state of this game the deus have decided that a pay to win model is better as well as not even thing to balance anything if you want to bang your head on you desk over and over and over by all means install this game if you like being constantly pitted against bots that take your entire team to kill while your whole team is destroyed install this game if you want a fair balanced game play do not install this trash july
early access review now i was very hopeful going into this knowing full well that it is a very early access copy adventure quest worlds was one of the more entertaining browser games i ever got to play as a child and i was very curious to see just how that would translate into a modern three dimensional image as a whole however i still find myself disappointed just not for the reasons you would think i the combat and the controls the combat i personally had no quarrel with the controls or the combat style of the game keeping in mind that the games design is true cross platform if i had to comment on it its not a very good idea to have everything limited as though it was a mobile only game what does this mean well the had is exactly what you think it is four to five buttons on the bottom right corner detailing your different abilities of which there are really only four for every class as the fifth button is your auto attack and your health and mana bar both of which seem very insignificant as unless you re heading into very high level territory there really int anything that can pose a threat to you not to mention it seems next to impossible to run out of mana unless you re fighting a boss mob as someone who playing on personal computer its not that in expecting tons more from a game that programmed to work on a cell phone however it still feels like artie particularly focused on the mobile aspect now i can only imagine this will change in the future when the deus have had more time to properly work on the game for now however it feels like the only thing that keeping personal computer users in mind is the fact that there a control scheme set up for them speaking of which the controls again i have no major complaints here save for the fact that they are far too simplistic for a game like adventure quest i do expect more than just click to interact and press a button to attack at least outside of their two dimensional games which even then had more interactive capabilities than this this is another case of the game being too one sided towards the is side of the target audience i still think that there will be improvement and it would be unfair of me to not give the developers time to do so however its still upsetting that it feels like the game was released into beta far too early given that they desired to capture the attentions of two separate users lets take a look at some other aspects of the game yes ii the graphics again definitely one sided towards mobile users but and a big one too there no denying that this is almost a necessity i definitely done find myself complaining too much as advanced graphics for personal computer users is something that can be integrated in the future like just about everything else that needs to be added to the game its art style is simplistic but still reminds me of the adventure quest universe i explored when i was younger there really int anything more i can say about this section really next ii the world itself how can i put this gently its empty like completely empty and almost entirely devoid of pc characters that are designed to be interacted with in battle on the main town in the game that adventure quest is known for i found more hostile pcs than anyone to talk to it seems they have many areas for the game already designed but they have yet to fill them with characters that either give you quests to which there is at least one per area shops of which there are next to none especially for low level characters that often depend on at least one or two buys so they can last long enough to get arm or from grinding something rather redundant as the first shop that actually has any of this only sells things that you can very easily grind for and overall life to the region itself battle on is a town that looks like it was abandoned in preparation for a full scale war of did i not mention that all the no hostile pcs in the town are just generic guards that cannot be interacted with in starting to ramble next section in quest for a game called adventure quest there really a rent that many quests every single one i ran into was either a fetch mission or a kill this many of this enemy mission both of which are flawed in a few ways fetch missions can be completed far too easily as the items needed are literally pointed out to you meanwhile hunter quests are just the opposite kill this many of that monster okay where is the monster that it how am i supposed to find it if i done even know where it is the fact that i ran into this exact same predicament at least five times before even ending an hour not too good again and i cant really stress this out enough the game is in an extremely early access build so i cant really say in entirely disappointed as there really want much to expect in the first place a conclusion of were at the end already that was fast anyway despite all that live negatively mentioned i like the way that this game is heading i really do think it has potential and i cannot truly blame the developers for any of it my final conclusion is that the game was released into its public testing phase far too early essentially there int really anything to test yet as you can most likely read on the top of this review i haven even played for a full hour and yet i feel like live already done everything the game currently has available to do artie entertainment had once managed to capture my young feeble heart with the majestic browser game known as adventure quest worlds even if i didst know what i was doing there was enough in it to keep me at least guessing what i had to do i would argue that for mobile the game would feel more complete were it not for the fact that live played full scale massively multiplayer online role playing game games in the past on my phone that felt far more diverse than this if i had one suggestion to make to artie its this done be afraid to add on to the game right now i had everything on maximum and my computer didst know what was happening as it had never run a game so smoothly before the game is not in the least bit finished much less finished enough for stress testing there is literally nothing to test here guys i final verdict do i recommend the game no at least not yet i recommend that you keep an eye on the game and the progress of its development as i know for a fact that artie is a company if you can really call it that given how few of them there are that likes to truly cater to its audience and try their very best to help them out wherever they can but right now the game int worth play in unless you re testing the mobile aspect of it
early access reviewing game deus banned my account after spending over fifty in game refused to do anything or give a reason to why avoid the game i will be taking the company to court
business tour online multiplayer board game review business tour is a game which is supposed to act as a digital clone of known everybody board game monopoly is it a worthy successor yes i think so and in this review in going to prove it nameplate game play is simple all you have to do is press the roll button when its your turn and buy the stuff you want to buy you get the money when you cross the start basically the way this game works is like the original monopoly except you use a mouse the game play is well made so to speak there are things this game lacks or has different than in the original monopoly you cannot trade things this easily also a nice plus is the possibility of online multiplayer graphics not much to say here the graphics are simplistic no flashy animations here it makes the game look decent music the game has only one tune playing in a never ending loop luckily enough this theme is not short and is pretty catchy it really made me enjoy the game more to summarize it all business tour online multiplayer board game is a decent game its good to enjoy with your friends its fun to play i advise you to play it you wont regret it
early access review once great now awful this game used to be a cross between min craft and world of tanks but now it a pay to win mess months later nothing has changed it makes me sad to see what has happened to this game its beyond the point of no return
amazing game and tons of potential horribly brought down by numerous bad design decisions and bugs rather than patch the bugs and bad design patches introduce more pay to win mechanics
been playing this from the beta days it was exactly when aka sura came out for the first time i can assure you that this game is one of the best mob games out there and about the steam release i couldn't get more excited
product received for free early access review used to play the rob craft often but after the new epic loot update i personal think that instead of being able to choose what you want to have and create your own unique play style it has become if you pay you can get the materials needed to do and create what you want with the loot crates you are given as a reward for playing you get one hundred random items and yet i have never got anything i wanted that wisent in the premium slot which of course you have to buy premium to unlock another thing that i disapprove of in the update is the robots feature which are what you use to forge parts but the only way to get them is to recycle what you already have for about one hundred and twenty five of its value depending on its rarity
hackers and bugs abound not worth the time and frustration if you re looking for something to just completely waste time costs nothing and you done get frustrated easily try this otherwise done i will be looking elsewhere for my zombie battle royal fixation
early access review the worst first person shooter i ever played and i have played a lot from project black out to call of duty cd so all those twitchy squad shooters now this this actually makes me want to install a notorious pay to win game than play this poor game of well i give it this it tries to be equal if any one is familiar with begone a unity based squad shooter for free this is the same thing you log in load up on kill credits and pay at spawn for arm or grenades it center so it starts most people off equal and you build up as the match stays open i personally like that than hard load outs but this game losses all points when one the maps feel baby block design hard to explain but super simple mushy non thinking turn here fire two because of this design the damage and hit detection is so off it feels like you are getting hit by paintball but problem is i played better paintball sims you can walk up and unload two full clips to peoples head and i guess there is a ring where sometimes it is a head shot and other times you just slowly reload and refine it is so bad it just feels so fake and silly it gives it charm though if you are tired of one shot kills in games like counter strike go and doubt who is a hacker or or skilled play this no doubts everything is pillow fight calculations you can swing hit a head but sometimes you get pm right in the eye three buggy this is what happened i log in play a round of earn enough to buy a grenade found out it is cool you buy it once done need to rebut each spawn game ended i quit the match joined a new server to get new group of guys and it says i have one grenade in the bottom right i thought of cool i use it nothing happens die of a bug that makes sense i done have one i just started and done have the kill credits yet i can live with that bug so i go back out decide to do a wall clip shot you know you shoot the edge of the wall as you edge out to get anyone hiding behind wall and use your own cover fire i die who killed me me i somehow killed myself i can only guess this the ricochet off the wall like this game is either so great so epic that it calculates deadly ricochet into my skull or it is so pathetically failing at being an first person shooter that it has no idea itself as a game who killed me i uninstalled on match two i can no longer continue pure cancer of yeah before i left i hung out in match a little longer because i noticed a lot of russians with high knife score in a gun battle i saw a guy passing walls floating and invisible one shooting with a knife hacked cancer the worse there is seriously you can get a better experience on a web based shooter called begone
hero and generals is a unique blend of first person shooter and strategy unlike anything else around at the moment adding these two components together with a development team that frequently adds new and improving features make this game one of the most enjoyable games live ever played the games nature encourages you to play with other players from all over the planet and getting to know new friend this way makes this game exceedingly addictive and a lot of fun to play the development team are excellent at keeping cheats at bay and despite being a small team do an amazing job at keeping up with player desires the bad as they do have a small team often response times can be slow so getting feed back from the deus is very difficult some decisions on the direction of the games progression sometimes clashes with the experienced players having each new faction added at war with existing factions apparently the plan is that once the british are added they will be at war with the germans the russians and the us a the deus can be slow to revert to better systems after getting feedback some decisions do leave players wondering if the deus have time to play the game much themselves in squad twenty and new spawn site protection system overall thou this is an awesome game with no competition out there that offers such a wide range of toys and playing level the grind is horrendous but still worth it if you can stick at it
early access review one of the best battle royal game out there with no doubt well made with very little bugs i did not find any bug just won my first game as well with two kill would recommend to everyone that loves battler yale games
early access review great game reno constantly adding new features weapons maps it center sometimes a bit buggy when they first release it but they iron it out fairly quickly this game is split into two parts first person shooter side which is fairly straightforward but depends on what units are positioned on the real time strategy map as you level up you'll be able to move some teams around on the real time strategy map yourself and give your first person shooter player some backup spawns it center the three factions fight for control of europe which you win by capturing the majority of the major cities on the map expect there to be changes to the game play they intend to change it a lot as the game develops but i think that a good thing the game will never get old and you know they re actively working on it and adding new stuff
have you ever played battlefield well if you have this is like a space battlefield this game is something my friends and i play all the time because of the epic battles and tactics that come with it the people who play it are nice and calm until a battle breaks out and the only battle cry you hear is taco bell other than the randomness of your clan mates you will ride in incredible awesome vehicles and your only goal is to run over every last person you see this game brings out the wildness inside of you because of the fast paced battles and the epic airdrop into the enemy territory overall you need to get this the updates may be long and boring but the new stuff is so cool you forget what an update is rating one thousand and ten May
early access review have spent forty and six hours trying to get into broken online only to find that they temporarily have restricted creating characters on certain servers guess where all my friends and my guides are on the server i cant make a character on shame on you deus how on earth did you come to thing that was a proper solution of all things i would refund in an instant but i am holding out just because i want a new game to play with my friends so frustrating your game will be dead within the month if you done bust your asses to fix this
it is interesting the graphics is of high quality but there are too many cards fifty for a new player it might seem difficult to manage them and for a card game it was running slowly in spite my personal computer fits the requirements i would not recommend this game unless you are a big fan of card games
this game may lag on low end computers but even if its inspired from min craft terra ria or whatever i still like it because the more you play the less you re gonna want to get out of it my rating for this game eight hundred and ten may
early access review was torn between writing a serious long review of the game or a short funny review of the game when in doubt humour done play this game with a full bladder would wet myself again
product received for freeze and my friend download the game to battle each other and unless you play against random people then all you have to do is came iron balloons and you instantly win how boring can a game be unless you pay a load of money to unlock the full game wast of time unless you want to spend time battling other people and not friend
crusaders of the lost idols is a strategy game hidden as an idle clicker your formation counts your equipment counts your talents count you just done have to play nonstop to progress unless you want to
early access review so i just played my first game and wow the game runs insanely well at amazing graphics that would be appropriate for an a a title by insanely well i mean one hundred and ten first person shooter on a ten sixty go on nearly max there only one complaint i have with this game and its a very big one the sounds now in no audiophile and done listen to music at all but the sounds in this particular game are absolutely disgusting and horrible the sounds are muffled you cant hear around you stereo or surround sound i think that what its called so it always seems like the sounds are coming from the back of your head gunshots are muffled the sound effects for the zone dying it center are just loud and extremely bad if you could fix the sound issue i would without a doubt play this game everyday so developer if you are reading this then please fix these sound issues i doubt it will take very much of your time and will make the game so much more enjoyable as a player thanks for reading edit holy a a a a a never mind it was my headset this game is insanely good ignore everything i said
please do not play this game i downloaded it and entered to the character screen after seeing how the character screen looked i deleted its local content later that day i thought i may have been to harsh on it so i installed it again i tried to ignore the character creation screen and i played about ten minutes before deleting the local content again again please do not play this game May
you cant reenact the most dangerous game have line battles that actually kill people hunt without paying girl dos you can ruin another players hunt by firing a rifle in the air when nearby spam the doe bleat call whistle like a bayou dweller deprive the local mule deer population of atmosphere absolute horseshit
early access review best replacement for csc graphics nine hundred and ten build on unreal engine three which is out date engine do but its still provide a good shade caching sex and even physics good job no studio replay one thousand one hundred and ten what can i said tho probably the best game of all time anytime endless of course its an online game good for poor man not have moneys for counter strike global offensive or bored from counter strike global offensive boobs and teenagers cons toxic gamers aim bots cheater paid downloadable content done overall points very recommended
early access review be thought a lot about this game and now i want to say about it first the game is better than pub second it looks not so monotonous or common third there are three classes which a rent different but they are very interesting and final the game is free so this game is good not the best but good if you want to play battle royal you have to try this seven snowstorms out of ten
to be fair this game has great investment in the vehicles sounds and models the game looks great however foreigner could care less when it comes to making good maps balanced matchmaking good events hiring competent friendly or staff the list goes on in adding my opinion to the rest of them currently in order to show foreigner they messed up by reintroducing chronicles such a a fun unbalanced mess that it was removed from future events the current event achievements are damn near impossible for anyone who wishes to grind them out and have a life and that coming from someone who is on disability currently and has no life many things in this game steer players towards just saying screw it and opening up the wallet to be effective right from the get go they introduce the atrocious grind i watched a player stream his first week on this game and he barely unlocked three tanks playing four hours a day without premium and i hear it only gets worse in the later tier graphics beautiful replay good audio very good audience everyone pc requirements decent get one hundred first person shooter on high with it difficulty easy to learn hard to master controls are easy to pick up but there are some advanced controls that you must look up or bind yourself and controlling each vehicle and learning its pros and cons will take a long time considering that you must unlock upgraded to be fully competitive you start off at a disadvantage also matchmaking is based on the perceived effectiveness of the vehicle according to the development called battle rating and not based on player skill or level so after you get out of tier one bot matches you will be placed with veteran players that can snipe your tank at all the choke points because they've memorized the map and distances to the target grind average grind level too much grind insanity be marked two because there are two different levels the grind level will be insanity if you done pay for a premium account to boost your research points if you do so the grind becomes about average you will still not likely unlock things very quickly even with a premium and even though it negates the unlocking grind for vehicle trees foreigner will introduce event vehicles decals and tournaments that are insanely grind and time based giving players usually only a day or weekend to complete which is hard for people with lives to manage story doesn't have an literally no story unless you count the historical campaigns thrown in last minute not worth playing done bother they give you a crap reward for playing and most of them are insanely hard to do on anything but arcade mode some can be fun to waste time in or get the hang of try out vehicles you may not usually use but that about i game time very short short average long endless you will probably play this until you are dead if you want to unlock everything bugs few bugs live had some spawn glitches mostly related to lag and some questionable things happen to my vehicle and shots but otherwise nothing to speak of multiplayer salt level salt if you play tanks re you will die from someone you cant see miles away over and over again be ready for it you will want to firebomb gains he for being so mean to their customers and putting out crap events servers can get saggy live had some games where live been unable to spawn or even exit the match because the server will report two thousand and twenty five packet loss on american servers when i do leave the game because of the server issue i get slapped with a crew lock on all my vehicles for not staying in the game server status you might wait a minute usually can find a game pretty fast especially if you are playing on a few different servers never really waited more than five minutes normal wait time is twelve minutes matchmaking you might see much more experience stronger players unbalanced you will face people at any experience level because the game is balance based on the vehicles you use and not your player skill once you have unlocked your first tier ii vehicle the game places you right into the fire you will face max levelled players while you are just beginning to learn the game high tier players will use low tier vehicles to seal club since they can memorize the map and weak spots on all the tanks and use this to their advantage that not even touching on the inherent advantages some nation vehicles have over others at certain tiers of the game may
no this game does not use re shell according to the original geddit post where everyone is getting the list of infected games from this game was a false positive anyways back to the actual review a decent idle clicker game with a lot of depth i would recommend it to those who like this kind of game i do enjoy the fact that there is no music or annoying sounds as with any idle game ever you get real tired of the same music and sound effects after a few hours laugh out loud
an massively multiplayer online with a great active combat system lengthy and robust progression rich lore from the granddaddy of rugs itself sounds good right well yes this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive so where does it go wrong honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole now being an massively multiplayer online errors and problems will surely show up from time to time i mean they re called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldn't expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to one still endgame bosses attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers which allows them not to be hurt or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few along side the numerous combat exploits are those have allowed players to gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited the exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to some are still present next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to mos but the path that these developers take with them is which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so last but not least is the free to play model that they use which before module six i didst really have a huge problem with whilst i did spend more than enough money on this game or module six it was more of a luxury than a necessity now with what i have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module six upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement pay to win feels like it has made its way here when all is said and done i did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new massively multiplayer online as in its current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money instead what i would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an box one is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and its community whereas the personal computer staff seem to barely listen to their player base on the whole may
after playing it for about a week decided to uninstall there are just too many small a fun problems with the the game the artificial intelligence is brain dead without gimmick deck the vagabond is a freaking cheater and aside from arena matches its really boring its a nonstop grind est farming gems and daily rewards and components to get more cards there no community functions outside of the chats that a filled with spam bots for gem scamming websites so you really done get to chat with other players aside from having to sign up on the the games forums i really done recommend its really only half the fun of yugo with none of its actual charm
early access review played this game for so long when the publisher is still gems cool coz in from indonesia then it comes to steam so glad that finally i can play this game again just make this game absolutely secure from cheaters and i think its gonna be a good good game and can contest any other first person shooter game and add some feature like vote kick add some guns that can be bought by bullet coz i done see bullshit coin is useful if its so hard to obtain and add some special guns which presented in previous bullshit version hope this game get big success
you have to get the guns full access downloadable content otherwise its not worth it the free to play part is more like a demo than anything else try the game and if you like it get the full access wait for a sale it goes for twenty or so buying individual packs or credits is a waste of money limo and if you want to unlock the guns without paying good luck with that this is not a free to play game but if you are into gun mechanics this is a pretty good game
best modern aircraft combat game at this time one thousand and ten realism but i play on the standalone version because the steam version is not updated just the damage model that needs to be reworked
early access review good fast games with allot of weapons to buy if you want to buy skins have to pay but that nothing more to do with the game but with the skins and only the problem is that there is allot of cheaters with aim bot guy with sniper jumps out the corner and shot you right in the head of if that happen once but all team members who going through that way had the same problem and not only once
most generous collectible card game live ever played because you can earn dust is the artificial intelligence you can grind an epic card in about one day and a legendary card every four days this makes this an extremely fun game to play as free to play if there is an awesome deck that you done have the cards for you can grind them up in a very reasonable amount of time this is my go to collectible card game and i have tried them all i cant wait for the mobile release this summer
probably the best free to play model i saw in any massively multiplayer online role playing game let me explain why in the cash shop all you can buy is fashions weapon look cosmetics if i remember well there is no weapon in the cash shop only name necessary item so you can perfectly beat the game without spending a dime there is pet mounts and all i said before in the a shop i heard that in some events you could get some kind of cash shop items characters there is no gender possibility in this game all you can change is their appearance by using some fashions for the skill slot you get half of it and its something like five for each character or the one you really want otherwise you are limited to four spell in your action slot which is fare more than enough to start the game but later
early access review used to be really fun with bros but updates have thrown this game out the window its the most pay to win game live ever known and there barely any fun anymore if you have a few thousand dollars then go wild
early access review this is the working beta of the first unit based artie entertainment game bright colourful cartoonish three dimensional graphics with quirky goofball dialogue are the trademarks of this small development team out of lakeland florida the game is in a constant cycle of development patches and updates as previously stated this is an open beta new content is added on a monthly basis generally speaking the newest update dragons of as fall added new beasts new dungeons pc characters the beginning of a new chapter as well as an increase in the level cap there are several dozen hours worth of quests to experience with more being added on a regular release schedule the game is a straightforward massively multiplayer online role playing game with a twist the full game can be played on a laptop tablet or phone on the same servers a friend playing on a laptop can instantly join in with a friend playing on his tablet as they fight in the same dungeons if two players have a gap in level the lower level player can sidekick up to the higher level to gain experience and rewards as they fight on an even playing field trades weapon fusion player versus player and more features are being developed to continuously add to the full game goblins dragons and undead skeletons await battle on
early access review for the people that done know it its a joke game its just something the developers of enlisted released as an april fools joke i guess people liked it so they are gonna release it as a standalone mode but it was never intended to be a game April
live seen a lot of people complaining about how you can get the real one yes you can get the real one but you can also get this version so you can play your tanks that you didst get on the normal personal computer version over all this game is real great i have some premium tanks that i done have on the personal computer edition so overall if your gonna get a premium tank just get it on the box or playstation four edition or even on the personal computer
early access review this is a very good game for free the one downside is if you done or cant play online the hardest bot is incredibly easy good controller layout occasionally online servers will spa and everybody will go to about thirty points then the server crashes and all is restored
its a must have game unique in many ways and extremely enjoyable also features trading which is way bigger than you might expect be sure to give team fortress two a try edit i proudly nominated team fortress two for the test of time two thousand and sixteen and labour of love two thousand and seventeen and two thousand and eighteen steam awards
this game is probably the worst i have ever played first of all the graphics are worse than min craft then there is the whole sprinting thing even while sprinting you go as fast as my grandma after thanksgiving terrible game play too you can hunt about five animals without paying a ridiculous amount to hunt other animals ten thousand and ten
early access review gives hello free realms vibes in the best way possible improvement over away not as cringe dialogue interesting art style decent starter classes and less annoying sound effects the three dimensional modelling is also quite well done and lets the concept art designs portray themselves better than the two dimensional flash animated counterparts
skipped classes thanks to data learned to gamble thanks to data learned to swear in twelve different languages thanks to data became racist thanks to data all in all ruin your life simulator one thousand and ten would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself cancer can be cure russian and sea communities cant be free to play game cant complain
i love this game it brings great aspects from games like wot and marries it with a three dimensional environment and ship with drastically different play styles worth every penny for a bug free and enjoyable game
early access review do not buy in its current state even as an early access title bless is not worth its price tag the game crashes unexpectedly and has some of the worst optimization i have ever seen not to mention the translations are garbage god forbid you get stuck on a loading screen or run into problems while playing as steam is not issuing refunds regardless of playtime anymore so if you exceed two hours you re screwed check back in a couple months and see if it is fixed and or still alive
this might be the only time to actually waste money on this game considering the seventy off otherwise the amount of money spent on this game just to collect cars and tracks is ridiculous for what you end up with compared to their older titles and hate to through in consoles but pm and it games then not to mention the upcoming project cars which in part of and is in my opinion stunning and love the the work those guys are putting into their new game project cars
its clear that on the developers list of priorities the games features and ability to engage took second place to how it would be monetized some of the worst habits of game publishers are on display here and to add insult to injury the game they re corrupting here want really worth paying for in the first place full review help wow home
this is the sequel to the first big three dimensional massively multiplayer online role playing game and i really like it its part of that world of war craft generation of massively multiplayer online a much like lot drift and wow but with a lot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much this game is fantasy turned up to eleven
in the chaotic month since the overhaul spark pants has shown to the community that they do listen to our feedback and and that they are trying to fix as many issues with the new client as they possibly can
early access review after the new update this game sucks sass in currently la one hundred and six and a beta player it was fun but after the loot update they made it where you cant earn money you have to get boxes to sell the loot for fourteen of its original value
early access review enjoy the game and its been slowly getting better performance wise and it feels like it has a lot of potential i put these issues down in hope that the development team will fix them no official forum just links to steam community hub need a feedback forum so they re aware of problems wolf noises howling out marta are so excessive its annoying i haunt seen a repair warning at all plus you cant do it below level thirteen done understand some of the quests art very explicit skill window doesn't really explain initially how to equip skills and terminology like the use of mount rather then equip is weird enhancing and upgrading companions int really explicitly explained how to get guild levels guild experience and how many members you can have per level int explained emotes art visible stones the gather able are very rare laugh out loud the publishers done seem very involved when people level people done know to do hunting quests the interface i feel like is causing a bit of lag i did some suggested in i fix that made the game lang so much less though i still have spontaneous first person shooter drop done understand why you cant use flight paths in areas your story hast reached yet unsure what the requirements are for pets to give buffs no stamina bar for when you sprint there are just some little problems leaving open doors to lack of information some weird balancing some conventionality it center it can be a little problematic but i do feel like this game has great potential if they made good choices in development
hello all i am known as sixth cytherea buck tucker and persephone in this community i have played the feb series since its inception in north america history of freestyle in wikipedia origin late two thousand and six i started playing the sierra online alpha version when it hit north america i was instantly hooked the pace of this game and the intricacies involved in pro play are what keeps me engaged we cannot compare this version of freestyle with the versions that came before it so i will review feb on its own merits review this is a free to play game you done have to pay anything to get started and you done have to pay anything to be pro create your character power forward center small forward shooting guard point guard it helps to have a basic understanding of basketball to understand what these positions mean you get a few default characters with different stats based on position their are special characters or specs that you can buy with real money that have enhanced stats what some people fail to realize is that if you are a free player that means not spending you get a free pc at level fifty so no you done have to pay to get a special character people that play this game are gonna say quot sent buck what about having to pay for extra skill slots yes extra skill slots cost my answer is that if you want need those then you are already high enough level or dedicated enough to need them you can absolutely play without spending money i have several alternatives that done spend a dime and do just fine now the the free to play thing is out of the way onto the game this is an arcade street basketball game with cartoony graphics and has an urban flavor if you like fast paced sports action and have a need for twitch reflexology then i cant recommend this game enough if you hate childish racist ageist in forty years old smack talk us look elsewhere the community is harsh most of the community is is some older most younger and most very immature please done let them get to you apparently girl people talk trash on the court i done get it because i done hoop girl and haven since the early a anyway graphics cartoony characters weird looking pets pets give you to attributes odd outfit sound six hundred and ten i turn off in game music and run pandora in the background people like to spam their emotes bow guys super annoying game play nine hundred and ten this game is all about timing coordination and using skills wisely it gets it right pcs are overpowered but meh i main of the classes are fun and true to their real life counterparts fun factor one hundred and ten its not a lot of fun to play with a its fun to play with people that at least try done be an elitist and you will have more fun i currently have three level nineteen fifties three more tools in pro around level forty and several other stragglers hit me up in game and seek out team brush if you are looking for a crew club clan i will be in rookie on a a i look forward to being you all and have fun also i have always played with a controller i do not play with a keyboard if you can i am amazed signed tucker team run
early access review love the graphics didst have time to experience everything but haven seen any major bugs although the game freezes sometimes after i jump to different sectors
id why people done recommend it like micro transaction even tho this game is completely free to play which is great and me myself done realize time goes by while playing this and this point i done even know why i play this simple game but i keep on playing it until like five am no sleep
takes some time to get used to and master it but its all worth it the player versus player kills of all type as dogfight all feel so rewarding and done forget this is the best military fighter jets simulator
can you please stop banning my communications like sure i chewed out a player but feedback should help i would not recommend this game to new people and snowflakes the company is a bunch of liberal snowflakes i had this game on mobile four years ago when everything was better i remember the following friendly fire for the boobs trying to steal kills on full he tank destroyer friendly maps luminous two tier matchmaking general chat where boobs can be boobs and stay out of battle edit of so take out all chat bans and the player base is restored please for the love of god tell the company they are dying quicker than pokemon go this game was intended for people over eighteen and of boy their feelings get hurt so easily they boast about reporting anyone like checkmate kid i win by proving you suck and need to uninstall war thunder is more friendly to people who like to curse and apparently this game needs to be taken off steam for sucking so bad and being censorship heavy if you say pizza its censored
this game has its quirks but i forgot how there is nothing like it and it just feels amazing with the sound up yeah there are saggy bits yeah it doesn't seem like the development team has testing infrastructure in place to reliably update the game but hey its unique and i love it
early access review if you enjoy getting hit through walls and an ever changing balancing system that involves nursing bad abilities and weapons and buffing the already good ones then this is the game for you its free try it if you like it enjoy it i think ill give it a little while before i go back to it to let the dust settle
good game but like any massively multiplayer online role playing game you will find yourself grinding to gain item drops then sell those drops for in game currency to buy what you need game gets repetitive fast but player versus player makes up for that but to do well in player versus player you need high end accessories and unique grade gear
this game used to be very good i have hundreds of hours beyond what steam says back when this game didst have steam release i quit because the economy became terrible due to gains greed i came back to see if anything had changed but no everything has become even worse than it was before the economy is still broken research is painful and flight model still sucks not to mention the matchmaking all these things have been discussed on the official forums with very good posts showing graphs and everything but foreigner doesn't listen to the players stay away from this game
great game but to really like it you've really got to play it you cant understand the game well unless you play it if you do play it you will understand the concepts of this great game
